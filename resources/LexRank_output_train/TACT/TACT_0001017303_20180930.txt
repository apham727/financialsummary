Net sales for the third quarter of 2018 increased $314 thousand, or 2%, from the same period in 2017.
Printer and terminal sales volume increased 12% to approximately 42 thousand units for the third quarter of 2018, driven primarily by a 73% increase in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 9% increase in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market.
The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 4% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due primarily to lower lottery printer sales, which sell at a lower price than our other products.
International sales for the third quarter of 2018 increased $1.1 million, or 55%, from the same period in 2017 due primarily to a 58% increase in sales in the international casino and gaming market.
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal due to lower sales to McDonald's.
This increase was partially offset by 81% lower domestic sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017. International sales from our POS automation and banking products decreased during the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due to lower sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald’s.
The increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due to an 79% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer sales in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by a large order of replacement printers from a domestic casino operator, as well as increased sales to our OEMs.
The increase in international sales of our casino and gaming products in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was due to a 76% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers.
While we expect casino and gaming sales to increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, we do not expect domestic and international sales of our thermal casino printers to continue at the level experienced during the third quarter of 2018 for the remainder of 2018, as the third quarter results included two large orders that we do not expect to reoccur in 2018.The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.Item 1.
