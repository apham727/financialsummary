Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP to be included in full year financial statements.
These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As of March 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $5.1 million.
As of March 31, 2019, $199 thousand of the accrued product warranty liability were classified as current in "Accrued liabilities" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the remaining $54 thousand was classified as non-current in "Other liabilities".
These outstanding stock awards are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, there were 540 thousand and 147 thousand, respectively, of potentially dilutive shares consisting of stock awards that were excluded from the calculation of earnings per diluted share.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, totaling $668 thousand, which was paid on March 15, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2019.
Consequently, financial information will not be updated, and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019.

Through our TransAct Services Group (“TSG”), we provide a complete range of supplies and consumables used in the printing and scanning activities of customers in the restaurant and hospitality, banking, retail, casino and gaming, government and oil and gas exploration markets.
Through our webstore, www.transactsupplies.com, and our direct selling team, we address the demand for these products.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2019 decreased $0.7 million, or 6%, from the same period in 2018.
International sales for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.5 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 primarily due to increased sales in the international casino and gaming market.
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was driven largely by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor.
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 to McDonald’s to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018. International casino and gaming product sales increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to a 77% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers largely to customers in Asia.
This increase was partially offset by a 70% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia.
The increase in domestic revenue from TSG for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to an increase in label sales and increased service revenue related to our restaurant solutions products.
Service revenue also increased 24% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 102% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers.
For the first quarter of 2019, gross profit increased $224 thousand, or 4%, despite a sales decrease of 6% for the first quarter in 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Our gross margin increased 480 basis points, increasing to 52.7% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 47.9% for the first quarter of 2018.
Such expenses decreased $56 thousand, or 5%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to lower expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
We expect engineering, design and product development expenses in 2019 to be consistent with 2018.
