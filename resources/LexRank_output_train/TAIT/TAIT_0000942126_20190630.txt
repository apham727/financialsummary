Sales returns for both the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $1,000 and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $4,000 and $3,000, respectively.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,356,000 and $4,597,000 at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,274,000 and $7,189,000, respectively.
In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our June 30, 2019, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 45% of current assets and 32% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the second quarter of 2019 totaled $1,772,000 versus $2,150,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $378,000 or 17.6% over the same period last year.
The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume.
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2019 was $835,000 versus $979,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 47.1% in the second quarter of 2019 versus 45.5% in the comparable period for 2018.
The $66,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase in salaries for severance pay incurred during the second quarter of 2019.
Other income, net of other expense, in the second quarter of 2019 was $31,000 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
Income tax provision was $1,000 for both the second quarter of 2019 and 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Net income was $256,000 for the second quarter of 2019 versus $399,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $143,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
Net sales in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $3,156,000 versus $3,805,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $649,000 or 17% over the same period last year.
Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $1,518,000 versus $1,633,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 48.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 42.9% for 2018, respectively.
