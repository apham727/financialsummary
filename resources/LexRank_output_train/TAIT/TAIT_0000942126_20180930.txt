These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and deferred income taxes.
Sales returns for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $2,000 and $6,000, respectively and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $5,000 and $154,000, respectively.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our September 30, 2018, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 51% of current assets and 36% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
The gross profit increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales unit pricing.
Other income, net of other expense, in the third quarter of 2018 was $29,000 versus $25,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Income tax provision was $2,000 for the third quarter of 2018 and 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018.
Net income was $279,000 for the third quarter of 2018 versus $214,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $65,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
Net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $5,707,000 versus $5,778,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $71,000 or 1.2% over the same period last year.
The decrease was driven by a decrease in demand for ODM projects.
