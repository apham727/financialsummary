Sales returns for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $0 and $2,000, respectively and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $4,000 and $5,000, respectively.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,207,000 and $4,597,000 at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,319,000 and $7,189,000, respectively.
In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the third quarter of 2019 totaled $1,658,000 versus $1,902,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $244,000 or 12.8% over the same period last year.
The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume.
The $22,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase in salaries.
Other income, net of other expense, in the third quarter of 2019 was $188,000 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
Income tax provision was $2,000 for both the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Net income was $515,000 for the third quarter of 2019 versus $279,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $236,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
Net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $4,814,000 versus $5,707,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $893,000 or 15.6% over the same period last year.
Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $2,406,000 versus $2,479,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 50% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 43.4% for 2018, respectively.
Other income, net of other expenses, in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $244,000 versus $106,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily derived from the gain on sale of our Mexico property of $160,000 and rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA.
