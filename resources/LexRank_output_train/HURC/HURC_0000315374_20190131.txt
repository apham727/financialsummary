For each contract, we identify our performance obligations, which is delivering goods or services, determine the transaction price, allocate the contract transaction price to the performance obligations (when applicable), and recognize the revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
Our computerized machine tools are general purpose computer controlled machine tools that are typically used in stand-alone operations.
For our five-axis machines that we install, we estimate the fair value of the installation performance obligation and defer the recognition of that revenue.
We consider these services to be perfunctory within the context of the contract, as the value of these services typically does not rise to a material level as a component of the total contract value.
Customer discounts and estimated product returns are considered variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded.
