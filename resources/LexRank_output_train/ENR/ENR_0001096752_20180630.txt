Acquisition of Jack Black.
The results of Jack Black for the post-acquisition period are included within the Company's results since the acquisition date.
In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a new Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
In July 2015, the FASB issued a new ASU which aligns the measurement of inventory under GAAP more closely with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Under the new guidance, an entity that measures inventory using FIFO or average cost should measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
The Company adopted these provisions of the guidance prospectively in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.Risk Factors and "Forward-Looking Statements" included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
