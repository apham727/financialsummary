The accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these financial statements.
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements include all normal adjustments and disclosures necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2019, the results of its operations for the three month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, and its cash flows for the three month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Significant changes to our accounting policies as a result of adopting ASU-2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and adopting ASU 2016-02, “Leases” in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which are discussed below.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligations in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
Installation is a separate performance obligation, except for our digital signage products.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties.
Installation revenue is recognized over time as our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided through the installation process.
The table presents a reconciliation of the disaggregation by reportable segments.
The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.
In addition, the Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease component and the accounting policy election to not present leases with an initial term of twelve months or less on the balance sheet.
The Company’s most significant leases are those relating to its two manufacturing facilities along with a small office space.

Fiscal 2020 first quarter operating income of $6.9 million increased $4.0 million from operating income of $2.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The $4.0 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2019 was impacted by the sale of the Company’s New Windsor, New York facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which favorably resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4.8 million.
Also contributing to the period-over-period change in operating income is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million with no comparable event in fiscal 2020.
