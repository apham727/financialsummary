In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements include all normal adjustments and disclosures necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of  December 31, 2018, the results of its operations for the three and six month periods ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, and its cash flows for the six month periods ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017.
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Significant changes to our accounting policies as a result of adopting ASU-2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) are discussed below.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
Installation is a separate performance obligation, except for our digital signage products.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties.
Installation revenue is recognized over time as our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided through the installation process.
The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred, and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.
This approach was applied to contracts that were not completed as of  June 30, 2018.
The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on  July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company has an implementation team tasked with reviewing our lease obligations and determining the impact of the new standard to its financial statements.
The Company will continue to evaluate the new standard’s impact to its financial statements.

Fiscal 2019 second quarter net sales of $89,541,000 decreased $2.8 million or 3% as compared to second quarter fiscal 2018 net sales of $92,305,000.
Fiscal 2019 first half net sales of $174,498,000 decreased $5.3 million or 3% as compared to first half fiscal 2018 net sales of $179,771,000.
Fiscal 2019 second quarter operating loss of $(20.3) million represents a $24.8 million change from operating income of $4.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $24.8 million change from operating income in fiscal 2018 to an operating loss in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Adjusted fiscal 2019 second quarter operating income of $1.5 million decreased $3.1 million or 66% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $4.6 million.
Fiscal 2019 first half operating loss of $(17.3) million represents a $2.9 million improvement from an operating loss of $(20.3) million in the first half of fiscal 2018.
Adjusted first half fiscal 2019 operating income of $5.1 million decreased $2.8 million or 35% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $7.8 million.
Adjusted operating income, net income and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of goodwill impairment, severance costs, transition and re-alignment costs, and restructuring and plant closure costs, are non-GAAP financial measures.
We believe that these adjusted supplemental measures are useful in assessing the operating performance of our business.
Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the periods indicated.
Lighting Segment net sales of $63,654,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 8% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $69,174,000.
Gross profit of $14,742,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $4.5 million or 23% from the same period of fiscal 2018, and decreased from 27.4% to 22.8% as a percentage of Lighting Segment net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales).
Selling and administrative expenses of $33,194,000 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 increased $19.2 million from the same period of fiscal 2018 selling and administrative expenses of $13,984,000, primarily due to the $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
