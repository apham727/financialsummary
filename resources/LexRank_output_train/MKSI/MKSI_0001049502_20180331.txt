Approximately 43% of our net revenues for both three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, were from other advanced manufacturing applications.
These include, but are not limited to, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, and research and defense.
For both periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, international net revenues accounted for approximately 50% of our total net revenues.
We expect that international net revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenues.
There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2017, other than the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606) as outlined below.
We adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
We have recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of $1.8 million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606, with the impact primarily related to our service business and certain custom products.
The impact to revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was immaterial as a result of applying ASC 606.
Revenue under ASC 606 is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer have been satisfied and control has transferred to the customer.
Installation services are not significant and are usually completed in a short period of time (normally less than two weeks) and therefore, recorded at a point in time when the installation services are completed, rather than over time as they are not material.
