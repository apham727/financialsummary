This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Approximately 56% and 58% of our net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers.
Approximately 44% and 42% of our net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were from other advanced manufacturing applications.
The semiconductor capital equipment industry is experiencing a moderation in capital spending in the near term and, we have seen a similar effect on our semiconductor revenue in the third quarter and expect that to continue into the fourth quarter.
For both nine month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, international net revenues accounted for approximately 50% of our total net revenues.
We expect that international net revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenues.
Also, on October 29, 2018, we entered into a commitment letter to provide for a $100 million asset-based revolving credit facility for working capital purposes to replace our existing $50 million asset-based revolving credit facility.
We have recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of $1.8 million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606, with the impact primarily related to our service business and certain custom products.
The impact to revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 as a result of applying ASC 606 was immaterial.
Revenue under ASC 606 is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer has been satisfied and control has transferred to the customer.
