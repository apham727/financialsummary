Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any forward-looking statement concerning the Company.
The segment table located in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements sets forth the Company’s results of operations (in thousands) including net sales, gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company’s five segments during the periods shown.
Net sales increased 11% for the 13-week period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the year-ago quarter.
Fitness was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 23% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 22% in the first quarter of 2017.
Total unit sales decreased to 2,956 in the first quarter of 2018 from 3,099 in the same period of 2017.
The current quarter marine increase of 9% was primarily driven by sales of the newly acquired Navionics business.
Fitness segment revenues increased 20% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by advanced wearables and newly introduced products.
Revenues in the outdoor segment increased 24% from the year-ago quarter primarily driven by significant growth in the wearable category.
Cost of goods sold increased 6% in absolute dollars compared to the prior year quarter.
Gross profit dollars in the first quarter of 2018 increased 14% while gross margin increased 190 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017.
The overall decrease in absolute dollars was driven primarily by decreased cooperative advertising associated with customer mix and fitness media, partially offset by an increase in outdoor media.
The marine segment increase as a percent of revenues was primarily due to expenses resulting from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018.
In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $19.8 million when compared with the year-ago quarter and increased 90 basis points as a percent of revenue.
Operating income increased 22% in absolute dollars and increased 180 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the first quarter of 2017.
The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds.
The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.
Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
The $0.8 million currency gain recognized in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling within the 13-weeks ended March 31, 2018.
