The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Jabil Inc. (the Company) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017.
The Company calculates its basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to Jabil Inc. by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
The difference between the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding and the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to dilutive unvested restricted stock awards and dilutive stock appreciation rights.
As of November 30, 2017, the shares available to be issued under the 2011 Stock Award and Incentive Plan were 12,327,622.
As a result of the modification, 0.8 million awards vested during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which resulted in approximately $24.9 million of stock-based compensation expense recognized for the three months ended November 30, 2017.
As of November 30, 2017, 3.2 million shares had been repurchased for $93.2 million and $356.7 million remains available under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program.
During the three months ended November 30, 2017, the Companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of its net revenue and 74 customers accounted for approximately 90% of its net revenue.
The Company procures components from a broad group of suppliers.
Net revenue for the operating segments is attributed to the segment in which the service is performed.
Total foreign net revenue represented 92.3% of net revenue during both the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016.
The estimated fair values of the Companys publicly traded debt, including the 8.250%, 5.625% and 4.700% senior notes, were approximately $405.6 million, $431.2 million and $525.3 million, respectively, as of November 30, 2017.
The estimated fair value of the Companys private debt, the 4.900% senior notes, was approximately $311.7 million, as of November 30, 2017.
The carrying amounts of borrowings under credit facilities and under loans approximate fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates.
The Company regularly sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset-backed securitization programs and five uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs).
Servicing fees related to each of the programs recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016 were not material.
The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of this special purpose entity as the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity from the transfer of the trade accounts receivable into the special purpose entity.
