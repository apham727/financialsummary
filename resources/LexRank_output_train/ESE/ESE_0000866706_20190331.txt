For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
The Company’s results for the three and six-month periods ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire 2019 fiscal year.
Significant changes to our policies resulting from the adoption are provided below.
We recorded a $4.2 million adjustment to increase retained earnings to reflect the cumulative impact of adopting this standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2019, primarily related to certain long-term contracts our Filtration and Technical Packaging segments have that converted to the cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition.
Revenue is recognized when control of the goods or services promised under the contract is transferred to the customer either at a point in time (e.g., upon delivery) or over time (e.g., as we perform under the contract).
A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and represents the unit of accounting for revenue recognition.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the expected consideration, or the transaction price, is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation.
Revenue is then recognized for the transaction price allocated to the performance obligation when control of the promised goods or services underlying the performance obligation is transferred.
Arrangements with customers that include payment terms extending beyond one year are not significant.
Approximately 52% of the segment’s revenues (approximately 19% of consolidated revenues) are accounted for over time as the product does not have an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for costs incurred plus a reasonable margin or the inventory is owned by the customer.
Therefore, each product is distinct in context of the contract and will be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.
Most of our contract modifications are for products that are not distinct from the existing contract and are accounted for as part of that existing contract.
We generally use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for our Filtration segment contracts the rate at which costs are incurred to fulfill a contract best depicts the transfer of control to the customer.
Under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation, and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred based on an estimated profit margin.
These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion.
Under the typical payment terms of our long term fixed price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based or progress payments.
This method recognizes the cumulative effect of changes on current and prior periods with the impact of the change from inception-to-date recorded in the current period.
Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable.

The increase in net sales in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018 was due to a $13.7 million increase in the Filtration segment, a $2.2 million increase in the USG segment, a $2.1 million increase in the Test segment and a $1.2 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment.
The increase in net sales in the first six months of 2019 as compared to the first six months of 2018 was due to a $19.9 million increase in the Filtration segment, a $2.3 million increase in the USG segment, a $5.8 million increase in the Test segment and a $0.3 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment.
In the first six months of 2019, net sales of $145.7 million were $19.9 million, or 15.8%, higher than the $125.8 million in the first six months of 2018.
The increase in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 was primarily due to an $8.0 million increase in net sales at Crissair due to higher aerospace shipments, a $5.0 million increase in net sales at PTI due to higher aerospace assembly and element shipments, a $3.6 million increase in net sales at Westland due to timing of shipments on government programs and a $3.3 million increase in net sales at Mayday due to higher aerospace shipments.
In the first six months of 2019, net sales of $84.2 million were $5.9 million, or 7.5%, higher than the $78.3 million in the first six months of 2018.
In the first six months of 2019, net sales of $104.7 million were $2.3 million, or 2.2%, higher than the $102.5 million in the first six months of 2018.
