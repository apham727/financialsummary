Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Xcerra, which is expected to be a complex, costly and time-consuming process.
In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated.
Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process.
As a result, it cannot be assured that the Merger will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.
Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process, and restructuring charges may significantly exceed original estimates.
Any delays in implementing such headcount reductions, or increased costs to implement, would materially impact the cost synergies achieved.
These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Furthermore, we expect to incur material restructuring and integration charges in connection with the Merger, which may adversely affect our operating results in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Cohu’s ability to utilize Xcerra’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards is severely limited.
As a result of the Merger an ownership change has occurred at Xcerra and as a consequence Cohu’s ability to utilize Xcerra’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards, that were already partially limited due to a prior acquisition, will be subject to annual limitations as provided for in Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383.
These annual limitations will result in the inability of Cohu to utilize a substantial portion of these carryforwards.

This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements including expectations of market conditions, challenges and plans, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by that statute.
Cohu is a leading supplier of semiconductor test and inspection handlers, micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) test modules, test contactors and thermal subsystems, semiconductor automated test equipment and bare-board printed circuit board test systems used by global semiconductor and electronics manufacturers and test subcontractors.
The level of capital expenditures by these companies depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and PCBs and the products that incorporate them.
For the three months ended March 30, 2019, our net sales increased 55.3% year-over-year to $147.8 million.
The increase in our net sales was driven by the acquisition of Xcerra Corporation, completed on October 1, 2018, and our results in the first quarter included sales of $82.5 million contributed by this acquired business.

Cohu acquired Xcerra Corporation (“Xcerra”) on October 1, 2018, at which time Xcerra became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu (the “Merger”).
Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Xcerra, which is expected to be a complex, costly and time-consuming process.
In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated.
Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process.
As a result, it cannot be assured that the Merger will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.
Any delays in implementing such headcount reductions, or increased costs to implement, would materially impact the cost synergies achieved.
These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.

Uncertainties underlie Cohu’s expectation that, relative to Cohu on a stand-alone basis, the Merger will be accretive to Cohu’s earnings per share.
However, Cohu cannot give any assurance that the Merger will actually be accretive to Cohu’s earnings per share.
