Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated as of May 7, 2018 among Cohu, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Cohu”), Xcerra Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (“Xcerra”), and Xavier Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu (“Merger Sub”), Merger Sub merged with and into Xcerra (the “Merger”), with Xcerra surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu.
Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Xcerra, which is expected to be a complex, costly and time-consuming process.
In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated.
Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process.
As a result, it cannot be assured that the Merger will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.
Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process.
These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Furthermore, we expect to incur material restructuring and integration charges in connection with the Merger, which may adversely affect our operating results in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
As a result of the Merger an ownership change has occurred at Xcerra and as a consequence Cohu’s ability to utilize Xcerra’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards, that were already limited due to a prior acquisition, will be subject to annual limitations as provided for in Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383.
These annual limitations, which are currently unknown and subject to further analysis, may result in the inability of Cohu to utilize a substantial portion of these carryforwards.
In addition, Cohu must assess whether its operating loss and credit carryforwards are similarly limited as a result of the Merger.

On October 1, 2018, Cohu completed the acquisition of Xcerra Corporation, and Xcerra became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu (the "Merger").
In connection with the Merger, Cohu and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, and other lenders that may from time to time be a party to the Credit and Guaranty Agreement.
Our gross deferred tax asset balance as of September 29, 2018, was approximately $31.6 million, with a valuation allowance of approximately $25.1 million.
As of September 29, 2018, we do not believe that circumstances have occurred that indicate impairment of our goodwill is more-likely-than-not.
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
