In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements.
The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The Company is a fiscal-year end taxpayer and is required to use a blended statutory federal tax rate, inclusive of the Federal rate change enacted on December 22, 2017 to compute its effective rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017.The Company reflected a loss before income tax benefit of $83,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to income before tax expense of $82,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to increase in contingent consideration liability resulting from increased royalty revenues for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations.
The Company reflected a loss before income tax benefit of $374,100 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to income before income tax expense of $78,200 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 mainly due to the increase in contingent consideration liability for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations and reduced income from the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations resulting from decreased catalyst research instrument sales.
The overall gross profit percentage for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 36.6% compared to 44.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to adjustment for increased contingent consideration from increased royalty revenues for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations.

The Company reflected an income tax benefit of $46,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to income tax expense of $17,300 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the loss for the period.
As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss of $37,700 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of $65,600 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
