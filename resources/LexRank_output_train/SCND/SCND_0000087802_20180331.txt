All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements.
The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The Company is a fiscal-year end taxpayer and is required to use a blended statutory federal tax rate, inclusive of the Federal rate change enacted on December 22, 2017 to compute its effective rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017.
The various provisions under the 2017 Tax Act most relevant to the Company have been considered in the preparation of the financial statements as of March 31, 2018.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 17% and 15% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (13% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues).
For the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 16% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (14% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues).
The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 - Prices or valuation that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
