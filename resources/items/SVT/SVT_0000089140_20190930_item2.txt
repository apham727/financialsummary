 Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview 



During the nine and three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 approximately 9% of the Company’s consolidated revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors. The Company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the ATG and CPG markets. While the Company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities, it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets, the foreign policies of the U.S. and other nations, the level of military operations and other factors, and as such, it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results. 



The Company’s commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today’s global economy, global competition, the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, market demand and acceptance both for the Company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate Company made components. 





The CPG consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Consumer sales are moderately seasonal. Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores. The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.

Results of Operations 











Revenue 



The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $3,159,000 or 9.0% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. During this period the ATG increased both commercial shipments by approximately $3,117,000 and government shipments by approximately $781,000. This was partially offset by the CPG decrease of commercial shipments by approximately $655,000 and government shipments by approximately $84,000. 



The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations decreased approximately $406,000 or 3.2% for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. During this period the ATG increased both commercial shipments by approximately $197,000 and government shipments by approximately $344,000. This was offset by the CPG decrease of commercial shipments by approximately $889,000 and government shipments by approximately $58,000. 



Gross Margin 



The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 was flat when compared to the same period in 2018. 



Gross margin increased in the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 due to the increase in units shipped of approximately $797,000 and due to an increase in average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $301,000 at the ATG as compared to the same period of 2018. This is offset by a decrease in units shipped of approximately $377,000 and a decrease due to average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $758,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018. 



The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased approximately $405,000 or 10.3% when compared to the same period in 2018. 



Gross margin decreased in the three month period ended September 30, 2019 due to a decrease in units shipped, average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $533,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018. This is partially offset by an increase in the gross margin due to an increase in units shipped, average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $128,000 at the ATG as compared to the same period of 2018. 



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 









Interest Expense 



Interest expense increased by 10.0% and 10.7% in the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2019, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2018. This is primarily due to the higher interest rates on the bank loans and a full year of interest paid on the equipment financing lease obligations. 



Income Taxes 



The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 17.4% and 20.0% for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 17.4% and 20.7% for the three month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate in both years reflects federal and state income taxes, permanent non-deductible expenditures, the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income and the federal tax credit for research and development expenditures. 



Net Income 



Net income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased approximately $551,000. This decrease is primarily the result of decreases at the CPG business segments and increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at both business segments. Net income for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased approximately $325,000, when compared to the same periods in 2018. This decrease is primarily the result of decreases in gross margin at the CPG business segment and increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at the ATG business segments. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



The Company’s primary liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal payments on debt. At September 30, 2019, the Company had working capital of approximately $24,978,000 ($23,141,000 – 2018) of which approximately $1,158,000 ($2,598,000 – 2018) was comprised of cash. The increase in working capital is attributable to an increase in inventory, mainly attributable to the ATG’s production increase slightly offset by improved number of days in accounts payable. 



The Company used approximately $245,000 in cash from operations during the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 as compared to a usage of cash of approximately $4,000 during the same period in 2018. Cash was generated primarily through net income of approximately $1,944,000, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash of approximately $1,042,000 and timing of accounts payable of approximately $848,000. The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 include working capital requirements, mainly an increase in accounts receivables and inventories of approximately $334,000 and $4,674,000, respectively. Cash used in operations is consistent with sales volume, customer expectations and competitive pressures. 



The Company’s primary generation of cash in its financing and investing activities in the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 included approximately $676,000 of proceeds from equipment financing and the line of credit draw of approximately $1,000,000. This is offset by the usage of cash due to approximately $411,000 of principal payments on long-term debt, approximately $404,000 for the cash dividend paid in July, as well as capital expenditures of approximately $1,660,000 to increase production requirements at the ATG. 





The Company has a $4,000,000 line of credit. The interest rate is a rate per year equal to the bank’s prime rate or Libor plus 1.4%. In addition, effective June 17, 2019, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.15% on the unused portion of the line of credit. The line of credit expires September 19, 2021. There was $1,000,000 outstanding at September 30, 2019 and zero at December 31, 2018. 



The Company has an equipment loan facility in the amount of $2,500,000 available until November 30, 2019. This line is non-revolving and non-renewable. The loan term for the equipment covered by the agreement is 60 months. Monthly payments will be fixed for the term of each funding based upon the Lender’s lease pricing in effect at the time of such funding. There was approximately $661,000 outstanding at September 30, 2019 and no balance outstanding at December 31, 2018. 



The Company believes its cash generating capability and financial condition, together with available credit facilities will be adequate to meet our future operating, investing and financing needs.
