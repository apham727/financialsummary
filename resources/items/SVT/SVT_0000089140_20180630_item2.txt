 Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview 



During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 approximately 9% of the Company’s revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors. The Company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the Advanced Technology and Consumer Products markets. While the Company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities, it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets, the foreign policies of the U.S. and other nations, the level of military operations and other factors, and as such, it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results. 



The Company’s commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today’s global economy, global competition, the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, market demand and acceptance both for the Company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate Company made components. 





The CPG consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Consumer sales are moderately seasonal. Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores. The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

Results of Operations 









Revenue 



The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $3,786,000 or 20.2% for the six month period ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. During this period the ATG increased commercial shipments by approximately $4,365,000 offset by the CPG commercial shipments decrease of approximately $474,000. Both ATG and CPG decreased government shipments by approximately $26,000 and $79,000, respectively, during the six month period ended June 30, 2018.  



The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $2,330,000 or 24.2% for the three month period ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. During this period the ATG increased commercial shipments by approximately $2,775,000 offset by the CPG commercial shipments decrease of approximately $270,000. Both ATG and CPG decreased government shipments by approximately $131,000 and $44,000, respectively, during the three months  period ended June 30, 2018.  





Cost of Goods Sold (including depreciation and amortization) 



Cost of goods sold increased approximately $2,457,000 or 16.3% for the six month period ended June 30, 2018 and increased approximately $1,192,000 or 15.2% for the three month period ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. This is due in part to the mix of product, but primarily due to the increase in revenue for the period ended June 30, 2018 from the same period in 2017. The consolidated production employment levels grew by 18.1% for the period ended June 30, 2018 and our gross margin percentage improved to approximately 24.5% for the second quarter of 2018 from 18.6% for the same period of 2017. In addition, depreciation and amortization increased by 17.1% and 9.9% for the six and three month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively, from the same period in 2017, primarily due to additional machinery and equipment procured for the ATG increase in production. 



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (including depreciation and amortization) 





Interest Expense 



Interest expense increased by 36.8% and 80% in the six and three month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2017. This is primarily due to the lease line of credit for the equipment financing for the ATG increase in production. See also Note 5, Long-Term Debt, for information on long-term debt. 



Income Taxes 



The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 19.0% and 9.7% for the six month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 20.0% and 29.5% for the three month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate in both years reflects federal and state income taxes, permanent non-deductible expenditures and the federal tax credit for research and development expenditures. 



Net Income 



Net income for the six month period ended June 30, 2018 increased approximately $907,000 and net income for the three month period ended June 30, 2018 increased approximately $602,000, when compared to the same periods in 2017. This increase is primarily the result of increases in revenue at the ATG business segment offset by a decrease in revenue at the CPG business segment as discussed above.  





Liquidity and Capital Resources 



The Company’s primary liquidity and capital requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable as well as capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal and interest payments on debt. At June 30, 2018, the Company had working capital of approximately $21,002,000 of which approximately $3,199,000 was comprised of cash and cash equivalents. 



The Company utilized approximately $237,000 in cash from operations during the six months ended June 30, 2018. The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the six month period ended June 30, 2018 includes working capital requirements, increased receivables due to timing of shipments offset by timing differences on payments to vendors. In addition, there is an increase in inventory primarily due to the increase in production by the ATG business segment. The Company’s primary use of cash in its financing and investing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2018 included approximately $274,000 of principal payments on long-term debt as well as approximately $150,000 for the purchase of treasury shares. The Company also expended approximately $984,000 for capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2018. 



The Company has a $2,000,000 line of credit available until June 19, 2019. 



The Company believes its cash generating capability and financial condition, together with available credit facilities will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs.
