Results of Operations









Results of Operations—Three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to three months ended July 1, 2017 



The results of operations for the second quarter of 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. Historically, we have experienced higher revenues in the fourth quarter as compared to the rest of the quarters of our fiscal year as a result of the purchasing patterns of our customers.



Net Sales



Net sales were $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2018, a $263 million, or 18%, increase compared to the second quarter of 2017, reflecting solid demand across the globe for our products and services. The net sales increase for the second quarter of 2018 included $154 million from acquisitions, $26 million from favorable foreign currency rates and $24 million from the adoption of ASC 606. The increase in net sales is reflective of growth in every region. Devices net sales within the Products and Systems Integration segment increased in the Americas and EMEA and decreased in AP. Systems and Systems Integration net sales within the Products and Systems Integration segment increased in every region. The Services and Software segment net sales increased in every region. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in the Americas was driven by the acquisitions of Plant and Kodiak Networks within the Software business and growth absent of acquisitions in both Services and Software. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in EMEA was primarily driven by growth absent of acquisitions in Services. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in AP was driven by the acquisition of Kodiak Networks in the Software business and growth absent of acquisitions in both Services and Software. 



Gross Margin 



Gross margin was $822 million, or 46.7% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $690 million, or 46.1% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by improved margins in Services, the adoption of ASC 606, and a favorable mix. 



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses





Research and Development Expenditures





Other Charges



We recorded net charges of $71 million in the second quarter of 2018, compared to net charges of $37 million in the second quarter of 2017. The net Other charges in the second quarter of 2018 were driven by $53 million of charges relating to the amortization of intangibles and $18 million of net reorganization of business charges. The net charges in the second quarter of 2017 of $37 million were primarily from $37 million of charges relating to the amortization of intangibles. The net reorganization of business charges are discussed in further detail in the Reorganization of Businesses section.



Net Interest Expense



Net interest expense was $58 million in the second quarter of 2018 and $51 million in the second quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest expense in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to the second quarter of 2017 was a result of increases in outstanding debt issued during the first quarter of 2018.



Other



Net Other income was $13 million in the second quarter of 2018, compared to an expense of $4 million in the second quarter of 2017. The net other income in the second quarter of 2018 was primarily comprised of $20 million of net periodic postretirement benefit and a $11 million foreign currency gain, partially offset by a $19 million loss on derivative instruments. The net Other expense in the second quarter of 2017 was primarily comprised of a $20 million foreign currency loss and $16 million of charges relating to the Non-U.S. pension settlement loss, partially offset by a $18 million gain on derivative instruments and $12 million of net periodic postretirement benefit.



Effective Tax Rate



We recorded $46 million of net tax expense in the second quarter of 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 20%, compared to $73 million of net tax expense in the second quarter of 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate of 36%. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 of 20% is lower than our effective tax rate for the three months ended July 1, 2017 of 35%, primarily due to the corporate income tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%, as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted December 22, 2017. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2018 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to a favorable settlement of a state audit, resulting in a tax benefit. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2017 was greater than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% partly due to change of estimates between provision and the filing of tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. 





Net Earnings Attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc.



After taxes, we had net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of $180 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018, compared to net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of $131 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2017.

Net sales were $3.2 billion in the first half of 2018, a $450 million, or 16%, increase compared to the first half of 2017. The net sales increase for the first half of 2018 included $201 million from acquisitions, $65 million from favorable foreign currency rates and $39 million from the adoption of ASC 606.The increase in net sales is reflective of growth in every region. Within the Products and Systems Integration segment, Devices net sales increased in the Americas and EMEA and decreased in AP and Systems and Systems Integration net sales increased in every region. The Services and Software segment increased in every region. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in the Americas was driven by the acquisitions of Plant and Kodiak Networks within the Software business, the acquisition of Interexport in Services and growth absent of acquisitions in both Services and Software. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in EMEA was primarily driven by growth absent of acquisitions in Services. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in AP was driven by the acquisition of Kodiak Networks in the Software business and growth absent of acquisitions in both Services and the Software business.



Gross Margin 



Gross margin was $1.5 billion, or 46.2% of net sales, in the first half of 2018, compared to $1.3 billion, or 45.4% of net sales, in the first half of 2017. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by favorable mix, the adoption of ASC 606, and improved margins in Services.



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses





Research and Development Expenditures





Other Charges





Net Interest Expense



Net interest expense was $104 million in the first half of 2018 and $102 million in the first half of 2017. The increase in net interest expense in the first half of 2018 as compared to the first half of 2017 was a result of increases in outstanding debt.



Gains (losses) on Sales of Investments and Businesses, net



Net gains on sales of investments and businesses were $10 million in the first half of 2018 compared to net gains of $2 million in the first half of 2017. The net gains in the first half of 2018 and 2017 were primarily related to the sales of various equity investments. 



Other







million of net periodic postretirement benefit, (ii) a $11 million gain on derivative instruments, and (iii) $3 million of other non-operating gains.



Effective Tax Rate



We recorded $69 million of net tax expense in the first half of 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 19%, compared to $114 million of net tax expense in the first half of 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate of 35%. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018 of 19% is lower than our effective tax rate for the six months ended July 1, 2017 of 35%, primarily due to the corporate income tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%, as a result of the Tax Act. Our effective tax rate in the first half of 2018 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation and a tax benefit due to a favorable settlement of a state audit. Our effective tax rate in the first half of 2017 was equal to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%.



Net Earnings Attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc.



After taxes, we had net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of $297 million, or $1.73 per diluted share, in the first half of 2018, compared to net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of $208 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, in the first half of 2017.

Reorganization of Business



During the second quarter of 2018, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $25 million including $18 million of charges recorded within Other charges and $7 million in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the $25 million were charges of $27 million related to employee separation costs and $1 million related to exit costs, partially offset by $3 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.



During the first half of 2018, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $38 million including $26 million of charges recorded within Other charges and $12 million in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources





Cash and Cash Equivalents



At June 30, 2018, $513 million of the $941 million cash and cash equivalents balance was held in the U.S. and $428 million was held by us or our subsidiaries in other countries. Restricted cash was $63 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 



Operating Activities



Net cash used for operating activities in the first half of 2018 was $75 million, as compared to $315 million provided by operating activities in the first half of 2017. Operating cash flows in the first half of 2018, as compared to the first half of 2017, were negatively impacted by the $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan, higher incentive payments, higher tax payments and the recovery of financial receivables owed to us in the first quarter of 2017. The contribution to our U.S. pension plan moves the next anticipated required contribution to 2024, or beyond.



Investing Activities



Net cash used by investing activities was $1.2 billion in the first half of 2018, compared to $189 million in the first half of 2017. The $1.2 billion of cash used in the first half of 2018 included $1.2 billion used for acquisitions and investments and $82 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by $79 million of proceeds from sales of investments and businesses. The cash usage of $189 million in the first half of 2017 consisted primarily of $140 million cash used for acquisitions and investments and $121 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by $72 million of proceeds from the sale of investments and businesses.











Financing Activities







To complete the acquisition of Avigilon during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we entered into a term loan for $400 million with a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the “Term Loan”). Interest on the Term Loan is variable and indexed to LIBOR. Interest is payable monthly, subject to our discretion. The weighted average borrowing rate for amounts outstanding during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was 3.35%. Net proceeds after issuance costs were $399 million. No additional borrowings are permitted and amounts borrowed and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed. 



Also in conjunction with the acquisition of Avigilon in March 2018, we assumed $75 million of borrowings under Avigilon's revolving credit facility, of which $35 million was repaid during the first quarter of 2018 with the remaining $40 million paid during the second quarter of 2018, resulting in the closure of the facility.



In February of 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028. After debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized net proceeds of $497 million. These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2018.



On August 25, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue $1.0 billion of 2.00% Senior Convertible Notes which mature in September 2020. The notes became fully convertible as of August 25, 2017. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.7476, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a conversion price of $67.81 per share). The exercise price adjusts automatically for dividends. In the event of conversion, the notes may be settled in either cash or stock, at our discretion. We intend to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash.



We have investment grade ratings on our senior unsecured long-term debt from the three largest U.S. national rating agencies. We continue to believe that we will be able to maintain sufficient access to the capital markets. Any future disruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital markets, or deterioration in our credit ratings, may result in higher funding costs for us and adversely affect our ability to access funds.









Credit Facilities



As of June 30, 2018, we had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement"). During the first quarter of 2018, $400 million was borrowed under this facility for the Avigilon acquisition, of which $100 million was repaid during the three months ended June 30, 2018. As of June 30, 2018, the outstanding loan amounted to $300 million. Subsequent to the quarter, we paid an additional $50 million. The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), at our option. The weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding amounts was 3.75%. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of June 30, 2018. 



Long-Term Customer Financing Commitments







Sales of Receivables







At June 30, 2018, the Company had retained servicing obligations for $844 million of long-term receivables, compared to $873 million at December 31, 2017. Servicing obligations are limited to collection activities related to the sales of accounts receivables and long-term receivables. 



Other Contingencies







Some of these obligations arise as a result of divestitures of our assets or businesses and require us to indemnify the other party against losses arising from breaches of representations and warranties and covenants and, in some cases, the settlement of pending obligations. Our obligations under divestiture agreements for indemnification based on breaches of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration, and for amounts for breaches of such representations and warranties in connection with prior divestitures not in excess of a percentage of the contract value. We had no accruals for any such obligations at June 30, 2018.







Recent Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method upon adoption. We have begun to assess the impact of the ASU on our financial statements, including the package of available practical expedients, required disclosures, and changes to internal controls. Based on the preliminary work completed, we expect a material impact to our balance sheet through the recording of right-of-use assets and lease obligations that were not required to be recorded within the balance sheet under current accounting standards.





Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements





We adopted ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method of adoption. The amendments in the ASU require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic cost (benefit) and report that component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The other components of net periodic cost (benefit) are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside of operating earnings. We have restated our comparative period results to reflect the application of the presentation guidance of the ASU. As a result of the ASU, the presentation of net periodic cost (benefit) has been updated to classify all components of our net periodic benefit, with the exception of the service cost component, within Other in Other income (expense) on the statement of operations. We recorded $20 million and $4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively, and $40 million and $1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively.



We adopted ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," and all the related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to our opening retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods.



We retained much of the same accounting treatment used to recognize revenue under ASC 606 as under accounting standards in effect in prior periods. Revenue on a significant portion of our System and Integration services contracts continues to be recognized under percentage of completion accounting, applying a cost-to-cost method. Services contracts continue to be recognized ratably over relevant contract terms as we stand ready to perform. Finally, revenue on equipment sales continues to be recognized based on delivery terms as aligned with the transfer of control.





Under the new standard, revenue recognition for software sales is accelerated based on when control of software licenses and related support services are transferred to the customer. Amounts deferred under previous software accounting rules due to a lack of vendor-specific objective evidence have been recognized as an adjustment through opening retained earnings.





 Historically, we presented transactions that involved a third-party sales representative on a net basis. After considering the control concept and the remaining three indicators of gross presentation under the new standard, we have determined that we are the principal in contracts that involve a third-party sales representative. Thus, we present associated revenues on a gross basis, with the affect being an equal increase to selling, general and administrative expenses for our cost of third-party commissions.



Under prior accounting standards, we expensed sales commissions and other costs to obtain a contract as incurred. However, under the new standard, we capitalize sales commissions and certain other costs as incremental costs to obtain a contract. Such costs are classified as a non-current contract cost assets within Other assets and amortized over a period that approximates the timing of revenue recognition on the underlying contracts.



The new standard clarified the definition of a receivable and requires us to present our net position in a contract with a customer on the balance sheet. The position is presented as either a receivable, contract asset, or a contract liability. Under the new definition, accounts receivable are unconditional rights to consideration from a customer. Contract assets represent rights to consideration from a customer in exchange for transferred goods and services that are conditional on events other than the passage of time. Contract liabilities represent obligations to transfer goods and services for which we have received, or is due, consideration from a customer respectively. We reclassified our customer positions to align with the new definitions and presentation guidance. Accordingly, Unbilled accounts receivable and Costs and earnings in excess of billings have been reclassified from Accounts receivable and Other current assets, respectively, and are presented as Contract assets. Accounts receivable which are not due from customers have been reclassified into Other current assets. Deferred revenue, Billings in excess of costs and earnings, and Customer downpayments have been reclassified from Accrued liabilities and are presented as Contract liabilities. Non-current deferred revenue has been reclassified from Deferred revenue to Non-current contract liabilities within Other liabilities.
