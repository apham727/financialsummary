Results of Operations









Results of Operations—Three months ended September 29, 2018 compared to three months ended September 30, 2017 



The results of operations for the third quarter of 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. Historically, we have experienced higher revenues in the fourth quarter as compared to the rest of the quarters of our fiscal year as a result of the purchasing patterns of our customers.



Net Sales



Net sales were $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2018, a $217 million, or 13%, increase compared to the third quarter of 2017. The net sales increase for the third quarter of 2018 included $145 million from acquisitions and $19 million from the adoption of ASC 606 (see Note 1 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by $9 million from unfavorable foreign currency rates. The Products and Systems Integration segment grew 10% driven by the Americas and EMEA. The Services and Software segment grew 22% with growth in all regions.



The increase in net sales is reflective of growth in the Americas and EMEA. Devices net sales within the Products and Systems Integration segment increased in the Americas and EMEA and decreased in AP. Systems and Systems Integration net sales within the Products and Systems Integration segment increased in every region. The Services and Software segment net sales increased in every region. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in the Americas was driven by acquisitions within the Software business and growth absent of acquisitions in both Services and Software. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in EMEA was primarily driven by growth absent of acquisitions in Services. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in AP was driven by growth absent of acquisitions in both Services and Software. 



Gross Margin 



Gross margin was $901 million, or 48.4% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018, compared to $794 million, or 48.3% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by the adoption of ASC 606 and a favorable mix within the Services and Software segment, partially offset by lower margins in the Products and Systems Integration segment due to acquisitions and lower margins on a few large projects.

The increase in net sales is reflective of growth in every region. Within the Products and Systems Integration segment, Devices net sales increased in the Americas and EMEA and decreased in AP and Systems and Systems Integration net sales increased in every region. The Services and Software segment increased in every region. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in the Americas was driven by acquisitions within the Software business, the acquisition of Interexport in Services and growth absent of acquisitions in both Services and Software. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in EMEA was primarily driven by growth absent of acquisitions in Services. The Services and Software segment net sales increase in AP was driven by the acquisition of Kodiak Networks in the Software business and growth absent of acquisitions in both Services and the Software businesses.

Reorganization of Business



During the third quarter of 2018, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $25 million including $21 million of charges recorded within Other charges and $4 million in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the $25 million were charges of $13 million related to employee separation costs and $12 million related to exit costs. 



During the first nine months of 2018, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $62 million including $46 million of charges recorded within Other charges and $16 million in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the $62 million were charges of $61 million related to employee separation costs and $16 million related to exit costs, partially offset by $15 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.



During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $8 million including $6 million of charges recorded within Other charges and $2 million in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the $8 million were charges of $7 million related to employee separation costs and $1 million related to exit costs. 



During the first nine months of 2017, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $30 million including $22 million of charges recorded within Other charges and $8 million in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the $30 million were charges of $30 million related to employee separation costs and $5 million related to exit costs, partially offset by $5 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.







Cash payments for employee severance and exit costs in connection with the reorganization of business plans were $51 million in the first nine months of 2018 and $77 million in the first nine months of 2017. The reorganization of business accruals at September 29, 2018 were $61 million, of which $39 million relate to employee separation costs that are expected to be paid within one year and $22 million of accruals related primarily to lease termination obligations that are expected to be paid over a number of years.



Liquidity and Capital Resources





Cash and Cash Equivalents



At September 29, 2018, $290 million of the $851 million cash and cash equivalents balance was held in the U.S. and $561 million was held by us or our subsidiaries in other countries, with approximately $200 million held in the United Kingdom. Restricted cash was $12 million at September 29, 2018 and $63 million at December 31, 2017. During the three months ended September 29, 2018, restricted cash decreased from $63 million to $12 million due to the completion of a settlement related to our legacy Networks business. 



Operating Activities



Net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2018 decreased $322 million, compared to the first nine months of 2017. Operating cash flows in the first nine months of 2018, as compared to the first nine months of 2017, were negatively impacted by a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in February 2018, a settlement payment related to our legacy Networks business, higher incentive payments, and the recovery of financial receivables owed to us by a former customer in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by improved working capital. The contribution to our U.S. pension plan moves the next anticipated required contribution to 2024, or beyond.





Investing Activities



Net cash used by investing activities increased $781 million in the first nine months of 2018, compared to the first nine months of 2017. The $1.2 billion of cash used in the first nine months of 2018 included $1.2 billion used for acquisitions and investments and $128 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by $90 million of proceeds from sales of investments and businesses. The cash usage of $415 million in the first nine months of 2017 consisted primarily of $383 million cash used for acquisitions and investments and $206 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by $174 million of proceeds from the sale of investments and businesses.









Financing Activities







To complete the acquisition of Avigilon during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we entered into a term loan for $400 million with a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the “Term Loan”). Interest on the Term Loan is variable, indexed to LIBOR, and paid monthly. The weighted average borrowing rate for amounts outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2018 were 3.33% and 3.43%, respectively. No additional borrowings are permitted and amounts borrowed and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed. 



In February of 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028. After debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized net proceeds of $497 million. These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2018.



On August 25, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue $1.0 billion of 2.00% Senior Convertible Notes which mature in September 2020. The notes became fully convertible as of August 25, 2017. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.8252, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a conversion price of $67.45 per share). The exercise price adjusts automatically for dividends. On September 5, 2018, we agreed with Silver Lake Partners to repurchase $200 million in principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes for aggregate consideration of $369 million in cash, inclusive of the conversion premium. As of September 29, 2018, we paid $169 million of cash to Silver Lake Partners and recorded a gain of $6 million from the extinguishment of the convertible debt. The principal amount of $200 million was reclassified to short term debt. In the event of an additional conversion, the notes may be settled in either cash or stock, at our discretion. We intend to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash.



On September 28, 2018, we issued an additional $200 million on the outstanding 4.60% Senior notes due 2028 bringing the outstanding total to $700 million. We settled the issuance on October 5, 2018 and recognized net proceeds of $196 million, subsequent to quarter end, which was then used to pay the $200 million principal due to Silver Lake Partners on October 15, 2018. 



We continue to believe that we hold sufficient liquidity to cover the day-to-day operations of our business as well as any future volatility or uncertainty that may arise in the capital markets.











Credit Facilities



As of September 29, 2018, we had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement"). As of March 31, 2018, we borrowed $400 million under the facility to complete the Avigilon acquisition. As of September 29, 2018, the outstanding loan amount under the facility was $100 million, with $200 million paid during the third quarter. Subsequent to the quarter, we paid the remaining $100 million. The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), at our option. The weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding amounts for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2018 was 3.58%. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of September 29, 2018. 



Long-Term Customer Financing Commitments





Sales of Receivables







At September 29, 2018, the Company had retained servicing obligations for $879 million of long-term receivables, compared to $873 million at December 31, 2017. Servicing obligations are limited to collection activities related to the sales of accounts receivables and long-term receivables. 



Other Contingencies



There were no significant changes impacting our commitments and contingencies during the three months ended September 29, 2018.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. In July 2018 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 that amended the ASU to include an additional (and optional) transition relief. The additional transition relief provides entities the option to adopt the ASU by applying the new ASU at the adoption date and recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without restatement of comparative periods. The new ASU must be adopted utilizing the modified retrospective method as of the earliest comparative period presented if the optional adoption method is not selected. We will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method as of the adoption date. We are continuing to assess the impact of the ASU on our financial statements, including the package of available practical expedients, required disclosures, and changes to internal controls. Based on the preliminary work completed, we expect a material impact to our balance sheet through the recording of right-of-use assets and lease obligations that are not required to be recorded within the balance sheet under current accounting standards.









In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20) - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,” which modifies the disclosure requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted. The ASU requires a retrospective adoption method. We do not believe the ASU will have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures.



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements





We adopted ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method of adoption. The amendments in the ASU require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic cost (benefit) and report that component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The other components of net periodic cost (benefit) are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside of operating earnings. We have restated our comparative period results to reflect the application of the presentation guidance of the ASU. As a result of the ASU, the presentation of net periodic cost (benefit) has been updated to classify all components of our net periodic benefit, with the exception of the service cost component, within Other in Other income (expense) on the statement of operations. We reclassified $18 million and $10 million in the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and $58 million and $10 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.



We adopted ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," and all the related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to our opening retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods.



We retained much of the same accounting treatment used to recognize revenue under ASC 606 as under accounting standards in effect in prior periods. Revenue on a significant portion of our System and Integration services contracts continues to be recognized under percentage of completion accounting, applying a cost-to-cost method. Services contracts continue to be recognized ratably over relevant contract terms as we stand ready to perform. Finally, revenue on equipment sales continues to be recognized based on delivery terms as aligned with the transfer of control.





Under the new standard, revenue recognition for software sales is accelerated based on when control of software licenses and related support services are transferred to the customer. Amounts deferred under previous software accounting rules due to a lack of vendor-specific objective evidence have been recognized as an adjustment through opening retained earnings.





 Historically, we presented transactions that involved a third-party sales representative on a net basis. After considering the control concept and the remaining three indicators of gross presentation under the new standard, we have determined that we are the principal in contracts that involve a third-party sales representative. Thus, we present associated revenues on a gross basis, with the affect being an equal increase to selling, general and administrative expenses for our cost of third-party commissions.



Under prior accounting standards, we expensed sales commissions and other costs to obtain a contract as incurred. However, under the new standard, we capitalize sales commissions and certain other costs as incremental costs to obtain a contract. Such costs are classified as non-current contract cost assets within Other assets and amortized over a period that approximates the timing of revenue recognition on the underlying contracts.



The new standard clarified the definition of a receivable and requires us to present our net position in a contract with a customer on the balance sheet. The position is presented as either a receivable, contract asset, or a contract liability. Under the new definition, accounts receivable are unconditional rights to consideration from a customer. Contract assets represent rights to consideration from a customer in exchange for transferred goods and services that are conditional on events other than the passage of time. Contract liabilities represent obligations to transfer goods and services for which we have received, or is due, consideration from a customer respectively. We reclassified our customer positions to align with the new definitions and presentation guidance. Accordingly, Unbilled accounts receivable and Costs and earnings in excess of billings have been reclassified from Accounts receivable and Other current assets, respectively, and are presented as Contract assets. Accounts receivable which are not due from customers have been reclassified into Other current assets. Deferred revenue, Billings in excess of costs and earnings, and Customer downpayments have been reclassified from Accrued liabilities and are presented as Contract liabilities. Non-current deferred revenue has been reclassified from Deferred revenue to Non-current contract liabilities within Other liabilities.
