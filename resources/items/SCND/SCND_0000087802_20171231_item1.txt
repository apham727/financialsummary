  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 



  Principles of Consolidation 



 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Scientific Industries, Inc., Altamira Instruments, Inc. (“Altamira”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, Scientific Bioprocessing, Inc. (“SBI”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, and Scientific Packaging Industries, Inc., an inactive wholly-owned subsidiary (all collectively referred to as the “Company”). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 



  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 





 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842). The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the new standard. 







 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”. This update provides guidance on how to record eight specific cash flow issues. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and a retrospective transition method to each period should be presented. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 



 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective approach which requires application of the guidance for all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard and does not expect the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 





  Adopted Accounting Pronoucements 





 On December 22, 2017, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, “Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or SAB 118,” which addresses situations where the accounting under the FASB, Accounting Standards Codification No. 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740 is incomplete for certain income tax effects of Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the 2017 Tax Act, by the time an entity issues its financial statements for the fiscal period that includes the date the 2017 Tax Act was enacted. 



 Under ASC 740, entities are required to adjust current and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the effects of changes in tax laws or rates at their date of enactment. However, pursuant to SAB 118, if an entity does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act at the time an entity’s financial statements are issued, an entity shall apply ASC 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act. If the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete, but an entity can determine a reasonable estimate for those effects, an entity can record provisional amounts during a measurement period, which ends on the earlier of when an entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to complete the accounting requirements of ASC 740 and December 22, 2017. 



 The 2017 Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. income tax system. The 2017 Tax Act contains numerous provisions impacting the Company, the most significant of which reduces the Federal corporate statutory rate from 35% to 21%. The Company is a fiscal-year end taxpayer and is required to use a blended statutory federal tax rate, inclusive of the Federal rate change enacted on December 22, 2017 to compute its effective rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017. The various provisions under the 2017 Tax Act most relevant to the Company have been considered in the preparation of the financial statements as of December 31, 2017. However, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of 2017 Tax act. The Company’s provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 is based on reasonable estimates of the effects of its implementation and existing deferred tax balances. The Company estimates it will record a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $30,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 due to an estimated reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the Federal tax rate. We expect to complete our accounting during the one year measurement period from the enactment date. 



  2. Segment Information and Concentrations 













 Approximately 31% and 55% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (48% and 30% of total revenues) for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 



 Approximately 12% and 21% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (19% and 11% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 



 For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 10% and 17% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (15% and 9% of the Company’s total revenues). Sales of catalyst research instruments generally comprise a few very large orders averaging approximately $50,000 per order to a limited number of customers, who differ from order to order. Sales to one and three customers during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, accounted for approximately 74% and 99% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations’ revenues and 7% and 44% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. 









 Approximately 36% and 52% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (46% and 36% of total revenues) for the six month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 



 Approximately 16% and 23% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (21% and 16% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 11% and 16% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (15% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues). 



 Sales of catalyst research instruments generally comprise a few very large orders averaging approximately $50,000 per order to a limited number of customers, who differ from order to order. Sales to one and six customers during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, accounted for approximately 64% and 97% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations’ revenues and 4% and 29% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. 



  3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 



 The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. 







 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 



 Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 



 Level 3 - Prices or valuation that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 



 In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. 



 The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables. 























 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value, and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimate is based on managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. Cost of work-in-process and finished goods inventories include material, labor, and manufacturing overhead. 





  5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 



 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisitions. Goodwill amounted to $705,300 at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 











 Total amortization expense was $61,100 and $76,200 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $122,200 and $154,100 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $124,700 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, $185,800 for fiscal 2019, $65,400 for fiscal 2020, $48,000 for fiscal 2021, $27,000 for fiscal 2022, and $7,400 thereafter. 



  6. Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share 







 Approximately 82,000 and 43,500 shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
