Note 1 Basis of Presentation



Basis of Presentation



In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements of Applied Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied or the Company) included herein have been prepared on a basis consistent with the October 28, 2018 audited consolidated financial statements and include all material adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly present the information set forth therein. These unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Applied’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2018 (2018 Form 10-K). Applied’s results of operations for the three and nine months ended July 28, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Applied’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October of each year. Fiscal 2019 and 2018 contain 52 weeks each, and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 each contained 39 weeks. 



At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Applied adopted the new revenue recognition standard using the full retrospective method. All financial statements and disclosures have been recast to comply with this new guidance. See “Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Accounting Standards Adopted” section below for further information.



Use of Estimates



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, Applied evaluates its estimates, including those related to standalone selling price (SSP) related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, inventories, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of share-based awards, and income taxes, among others. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. 



Changes to Significant Accounting Policies 



Applied adopted various amended guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The following accounting policies have been updated as part of the adoption of the new standards.



Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 



Applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues Applied has identified. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to Applied. Bad debt expense and any reversals are recorded in marketing and selling expenses in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Operations. 



Sales and Value Added Taxes 



Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations.



Shipping and Handling Costs



Applied accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill our promise to transfer the associated products. Accordingly, amounts billed for shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of net sales and costs as a component of cost of products sold. 



Warranty 



Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. 





APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



Applied also sells extended warranty contracts to its customers which provide an extension of the standard warranty coverage period of up to 2 years. Applied receives payment at the inception of the contract and recognizes revenue ratably over the extended warranty coverage period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the extended warranty.



Revenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers



Applied recognizes revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Applied expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Applied determines revenue recognition through the following five steps; (1) identification of the contract(s) with customers, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.



Identifying the contract(s) with customers. Applied sells manufacturing equipment, services, and spare parts directly to its customers in the semiconductor, display, and related industries. The Company generally considers written documentation including, but not limited to, signed purchase orders, master agreements, and sales orders as contracts provided that collection is probable. Collectability is assessed based on the customer’s creditworthiness determined by reviewing the customer’s published credit and financial information, historical payment experience, as well as other relevant factors.



Identifying the performance obligations. Applied’s performance obligations include delivery of manufacturing equipment, service agreements, spare parts, installation, extended warranty and training. Applied’s service agreements are considered one performance obligation and may include multiple goods and services that Applied provides to the customer to deliver against a performance metric. Judgment is used to determine whether multiple promised goods or services in a contract should be accounted for separately or as a group. 



Determine the transaction price. The transaction price for Applied’s contracts with customers may include fixed and variable consideration. Applied includes variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. 



Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation identified within the contract. Applied generally estimates the standalone selling price of a distinct performance obligation based on historical cost plus an appropriate margin. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, Applied allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.



Recognizing the revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. Applied recognizes revenue from equipment and spares parts at a point in time when Applied has satisfied its performance obligation by transferring control of the goods to the customer which typically occurs at shipment or delivery. Revenue from service agreements is recognized over time as customers receive the benefits of services. 



The incremental costs to obtain a contract are not material.



Payment Terms. Payment terms vary by contract. Generally, the majority of payments are due within a certain number of days from shipment of goods or performance of service. The remainder is typically due upon customer technical acceptance. Applied typically receives deposits on future deliverables from customers in the Display and Adjacent Markets segment and, in certain instances, may also receive deposits from customers in the Applied Global Services segment. Applied’s payment terms do not generally contain a significant financing component.



Investments



All of Applied’s investments, except equity investments held in privately-held companies, are classified as available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates. Investments classified as available-for-sale are measured and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest earned on cash and investments, as well as realized gains and losses on sale of securities, are included in interest and other income, net in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations.



Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost, less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes. Adjustments resulting from impairments and observable prices changes will be recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Accounting Standards Adopted



Retirement Benefits. In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires companies to present the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line items in which they report compensation cost. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented. Applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance resulted in reclassification of other components of net benefit costs outside of income from operations and did not have a significant impact on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.



Business Combinations. In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the definition of a business to help companies evaluate whether acquisition or disposal transactions should be accounted for as asset groups or as businesses. Applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a prospective basis. The impact of the adoption depends on the facts and circumstances of future acquisition or disposal transactions.





Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which addresses classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments related to the statement of cash flows. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Applied adopted the authoritative guidance retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact and only impacts disclosures in Applied' s consolidated condensed statements of cash flow.





Revenue Recognition. In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and requires certain additional disclosures. Applied adopted this authoritative guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the full retrospective method, which required restating each prior reporting period presented. Refer to the Impacts to Previously Reported Results section below for the impact of the adoption of the standard to Applied’s consolidated financial statements.



For all periods prior to the date of initial adoption of this standard, Applied elected to use the practical expedient pursuant to which Applied excluded disclosures of both transaction prices allocated to remaining performance obligations and when these performance obligations are expected to be recognized as revenue.



The most significant impact from the adoption of this standard is fewer constraints on revenue recognition upon shipment of manufacturing equipment.

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted







Derivatives and Hedging. In August 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that modifies the recognition and presentation of hedge accounting to better align an entity’s risk management strategies and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The authoritative guidance expands the application of hedge accounting for non-financial and financial risk components and eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. While the Company's evaluation of the impact of this new guidance is not complete, it is not currently expected to have a significant impact on Applied’s consolidated financial statements. 





Goodwill Impairment. In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that simplifies the process required to test goodwill for impairment. The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.

Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for lease accounting, which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for certain lease arrangements that are classified as operating leases under the previous standard, and to provide for enhanced disclosures. The authoritative guidance should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. Applied currently anticipates adopting this guidance using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 and will not adjust comparative prior periods. While the Company's evaluation of the impact of this new guidance is not complete, Applied currently expects that the primary impact of the new standard will be the recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, mainly related to leases classified as operating leases. Applied is currently implementing changes to business processes and controls to support measurement and disclosure requirements under the new standard.

Earnings Per Share



Basic earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares (representing the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan shares) outstanding during the period. Applied’s net income has not been adjusted for any period presented for purposes of computing basic or diluted earnings per share due to the Company’s non-complex capital structure. 





Potentially weighted dilutive securities attributable to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share where the combined exercise price and average unamortized fair value are greater than the average market price of Applied common stock, and therefore their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Gains and Losses on Investments



During the three and nine months ended July 28, 2019 gross realized gains and losses on investments were not material. During the three and nine months ended July 29, 2018, gross realized gains on investments were $13 million and $14 million, respectively, and the gross realized losses on investments for these periods were not material. 







APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



Applied determined that the gross unrealized losses on its marketable fixed-income securities as of July 28, 2019 and July 29, 2018 were temporary in nature and therefore it did not recognize any impairment of its marketable fixed-income securities during the three and nine months ended July 28, 2019 or July 29, 2018. Impairment charges on equity investments in privately-held companies during the three and nine months ended July 28, 2019 and July 29, 2018 were not material. These impairment charges are included in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)





Fair Value Measurements



Applied’s financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity investments in privately-held companies. These equity investments are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. Applied’s nonfinancial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.



Fair Value Hierarchy





•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;



•Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and



•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.



Applied’s investments consist primarily of debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at their fair values. In determining the fair value of investments, Applied uses pricing information from pricing services that value securities based on quoted market prices and models that utilize observable market inputs. In the event a fair value estimate is unavailable from a pricing service, Applied generally obtains non-binding price quotes from brokers. Applied then reviews the information provided by the pricing services or brokers to determine the fair value of its short-term and long-term investments. In addition, to validate pricing information obtained from pricing services, Applied periodically performs supplemental analysis on a sample of securities. Applied reviews any significant unanticipated differences identified through this analysis to determine the appropriate fair value. As of July 28, 2019, substantially all of Applied’s available-for-sale, short-term and long-term investments were recognized at fair value that was determined based upon observable inputs.



Applied’s equity investments with readily determinable values consist of publicly traded equity securities. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01, these investments are measured at fair value using quoted prices for identical assets in an active market and the changes in fair value of these equity investments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Applied adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using a modified retrospective transition method and reclassified the unrealized gains on these equity investments of $21 million to retained earnings as a cumulative-effect adjustment on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.



Investments with remaining effective maturities of 12 months or less from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining effective maturities of more than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis







There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the three and nine months ended July 28, 2019 or July 29, 2018. Applied did not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements as of July 28, 2019 or October 28, 2018.



Assets and Liabilities without Readily Determinable Values Measured on a Non-recurring Basis



Applied’s equity investments without readily determinable values consist of equity investments in privately-held companies. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01, Applied elected the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes on a prospective basis for certain equity investments without readily determinable fair values and is required to account for any subsequent observable changes in fair value within the statements of operations. Applied adopted the guidance prospectively, effective October 29, 2018, and there was no impact to Applied’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, these investments were generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting. These investments are periodically assessed for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that a decline in value may have occurred. Impairment charges on equity investments in privately-held companies during the three and nine months ended July 28, 2019 and July 29, 2018 were not material.



Other



The carrying amounts of Applied’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable - short term, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. As of July 28, 2019, the aggregate principal amount of long-term debt was $5.4 billion, and the estimated fair value was $5.9 billion. As of October 28, 2018, the aggregate principal and estimated fair value amounts of long-term debt were both $5.4 billion. The estimated fair value of long-term debt is determined by Level 2 inputs and is based primarily on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further detail of existing debt.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)





Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities



Derivative Financial Instruments



Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as the Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Taiwanese dollar. Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within the next 24 months. The purpose of Applied’s foreign currency management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged. 



Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign currency exchange and interest rate contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of any hedges, are recognized currently in earnings. All of Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair value in other current assets or in accounts payable and accrued expenses. 



Hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and foreign exchange derivatives are typically entered into once per month. Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of AOCI in stockholders’ equity and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. The majority of the after-tax net income or loss related to foreign exchange derivative instruments included in AOCI as of July 28, 2019 is expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months. Changes in the fair value of currency forward exchange and option contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness. Both ineffective hedge amounts and hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings. If the transaction being hedged is no longer probable to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is deemed to be ineffective, Applied promptly recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument in earnings. The amount recognized due to discontinuance of cash flow hedges that were probable not to occur by the end of the originally specified time period was not significant for the three and nine months ended July 28, 2019 and July 29, 2018.



Additionally, forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. These derivatives are typically entered into once per month and are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.



The fair values of foreign exchange derivative instruments as of July 28, 2019 and October 28, 2018 were not material.

Credit Risk Contingent Features



If Applied’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, it would be in violation of credit risk contingent provisions of the derivative instruments discussed above, and certain counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position was immaterial as of July 28, 2019.



Entering into derivative contracts with banks exposes Applied to credit-related losses in the event of the banks’ nonperformance. However, Applied’s exposure is not considered significant.





Accounts Receivable, Net 



Applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. Applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse. Applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. The discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. 



Applied sold $143 million and $1.3 billion of accounts receivable during the three and nine months ended July 28, 2019, respectively. Applied sold $271 million and $1.0 billion of accounts receivable during the three and nine months ended July 29, 2018, respectively. Applied discounted letters of credit issued by customers of $40 million during the three and nine months ended July 28, 2019. Applied did not discount letters of credit issued by customers or discount promissory notes during the three and nine months ended July 29, 2018. Financing charges on the sale of receivables and discounting of letters of credit are included in interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations and were not material for all periods presented.



Accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $30 million and $33 million as of July 28, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. Applied sells its products principally to manufacturers within the semiconductor and display industries. While Applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate and represents its best estimate as of July 28, 2019, it continues to closely monitor customer liquidity and industry and economic conditions, which may result in changes to Applied’s estimates. 



Note 7 Contract Balances



Contract assets primarily result from receivables for goods transferred to customers where payment is conditional upon technical sign off and not just the passage of time. Contract liabilities consist of unsatisfied performance obligations related to advance payments received and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Applied’s contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.



Contract assets are generally classified as current and included in Other Current Assets in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when performance obligations will be satisfied and associated revenue is expected to be recognized.







The increase in contract assets during the nine months ended July 28, 2019, was primarily due to goods transferred to customers where payment was conditional upon technical sign off, offset by the reclassification of contract assets to net accounts receivable upon meeting conditions to the right to payment.



During the nine months ended July 28, 2019, Applied recognized revenue of approximately $622 million related to contract liabilities at October 28, 2018. This reduction in contract liabilities was offset by new billings for products and services for which there were unsatisfied performance obligations to customers and revenue had not yet been recognized as of July 28, 2019.



There were no impairment losses recognized on Applied’s accounts receivables and contract assets during the three and nine months ended July 28, 2019.





APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



As of July 28, 2019, the amount of remaining unsatisfied performance obligations on contracts with an original estimated duration of one year or more was approximately $808 million, which is expected to be recognized within the next 36 months. Applied has elected the available practical expedient to exclude the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.





Balance Sheet Detail





Included in finished goods inventory are $11 million as of July 28, 2019, and $19 million as of October 28, 2018, of newly-introduced systems at customer locations where the sales transaction did not meet Applied’s revenue recognition criteria as set forth in Note 1. Finished goods inventory includes $327 million and $350 million of evaluation inventory as of July 28, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively.

Business Combination



Kokusai Electric Corporation



On June 30, 2019, Applied entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) to acquire all outstanding shares of Kokusai Electric Corporation (Kokusai Electric) for $2.2 billion in cash. Kokusai Electric is a leading company in providing high-productivity batch processing systems and services for memory, foundry and logic customers. These systems complement Applied’s leadership portfolio in single-wafer processing systems. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.



Note 10Goodwill, Purchased Technology and Other Intangible Assets



Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets



Applied’s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Applied assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the date of acquisition. Typically, acquisitions relate to a single reporting unit and thus do not require the allocation of goodwill to multiple reporting units. If the products obtained in an acquisition are assigned to multiple reporting units, the goodwill is distributed to the respective reporting units as part of the purchase price allocation process.



Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment, especially in emerging markets. Applied regularly monitors current business conditions and considers other factors including, but not limited to, adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions and lower projections of profitability that may impact future operating results.



To test goodwill for impairment, Applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, Applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, Applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Applied determines the fair value of each of its reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If Applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, Applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.



As of July 28, 2019, Applied’s reporting units include Semiconductor Product Group and Imaging and Process Control Group, which combine to form the Semiconductor Systems reporting segment, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. 



The evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment. In the event of future changes in business conditions, Applied will be required to reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses. If the results of these future analyses are lower than current estimates, a material impairment charge may result at that time. 









APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



During the nine months ended July 28, 2019, the increase in goodwill was primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, which were not significant to Applied’s results of operations.







Finite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets



Applied amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from 1 to 15 years.



Applied evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. Applied assesses the fair value of the assets based on the amount of the undiscounted future cash flow that the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset, plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When Applied identifies an impairment, Applied reduces the carrying value of the group of assets to comparable market values, when available and appropriate, or to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach.



Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. Applied evaluates the useful lives of its intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances require revising the remaining period of amortization. In addition, Applied reviews intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Management considers such indicators as significant differences in actual product acceptance from the estimates, changes in the competitive and economic environments, technological advances, and changes in cost structure.

Note 11Borrowing Facilities and Debt



Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in September 2021. This agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to one of various benchmark rates selected by Applied for each advance, plus a margin based on Applied’s public debt rating and includes financial and other covenants. Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $74 million are with Japanese banks. Applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. Applied has not utilized these credit facilities and no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities as of both July 28, 2019 and October 28, 2018. In fiscal 2011, Applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. As of July 28, 2019, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding.



Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Applied entered into a term loan credit agreement with a group of lenders. Under the agreement, the lenders have committed to make an unsecured term loan to Applied of up to $2.0 billion to finance in part Applied’s planned acquisition of all outstanding shares of Kokusai Electric, to pay related transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. The commitments of the lenders to make the term loan will terminate if the transactions contemplated by the SPA are not consummated on or before June 30, 2020, which date may be extended by three months on two separate occasions if, on the applicable date, the only remaining conditions to closing relate to required regulatory approvals. The term loan, if advanced, will bear interest at one of two rates selected by Applied, plus an applicable margin, which varies according to Applied’s public debt credit ratings, and must be repaid in full on the third anniversary of the funding date of the term loan.

Stock Repurchase Program



In February 2018, the Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing up to an aggregate of $6.0 billion in repurchases. As of July 28, 2019, approximately $2.4 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program.







Applied records treasury stock purchases under the cost method using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Upon reissuance of treasury stock, amounts in excess of the acquisition cost are credited to additional paid in capital. If Applied reissues treasury stock at an amount below its acquisition cost and additional paid in capital associated with prior treasury stock transactions is insufficient to cover the difference between the acquisition cost and the reissue price, this difference is recorded against retained earnings. 



Dividends



In June 2019, March 2019 and December 2018, Applied’s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends, in the amount of $0.21, $0.21 and $0.20 per share, respectively. The dividend declared in June 2019 is payable in September 2019. Dividends paid during the nine months ended July 28, 2019 and July 29, 2018 totaled $577 million and $410 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applied’s stockholders. 



Share-Based Compensation



Applied has a stockholder-approved equity plan, the Employee Stock Incentive Plan, which permits grants to employees of share-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units. In addition, the plan provides for the automatic grant of restricted stock units to non-employee directors and permits the grant of share-based awards to non-employee directors and consultants. Share-based awards made under the plan may be subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances in the event of a change in control of Applied. Applied also has two Employee Stock Purchase Plans, one generally for United States employees and a second for employees of international subsidiaries (collectively, ESPP), which enable eligible employees to purchase Applied common stock. 









APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



The cost associated with share-based awards that are subject solely to time-based vesting requirements, less expected forfeitures, is recognized over the awards’ service period for the entire award on a straight-line basis. The cost associated with performance-based equity awards, which include both performance and market goals, is recognized for each tranche over the service period. The cost of equity awards related to performance goals is based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved. For the equity awards based on market goals, the cost is recognized based upon the assumption of 100% achievement of the goal.



As of July 28, 2019, Applied had $417 million in total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to grants of share-based awards and shares issued under Applied’s ESPP, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years. As of July 28, 2019, there were 67 million shares available for grants of share-based awards under the Employee Stock Incentive Plan, and an additional 15 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.



Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares and Performance Units







As of July 28, 2019, 1.6 million additional performance-based awards could be earned based upon achievement of certain levels of specified performance goals.





The awards become eligible to vest only if performance goals are achieved and will vest only if the grantee remains employed by Applied through each applicable vesting date, subject to a qualifying retirement described below. The number of shares that may vest in full after three years ranges from 0% to 200% of the target amount. The awards provide for a partial payout based on actual performance at the conclusion of the three-year performance period in the event of a qualifying retirement based on age and years of service.



The fair value of the portion of the awards subject to targeted levels of adjusted operating margin is estimated on the date of grant. If the performance goals are not met as of the end of the performance period, no compensation expense is recognized, and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. The expected cost is based on the portion of the awards that is probable to vest and is reflected over the service period and reduced for estimated forfeitures. 



The fair value of the portion of the awards subject to targeted levels of relative total shareholder return is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized based upon the assumption of 100% achievement of the TSR goal and will not be reversed even if the threshold level of TSR is never achieved, and is reflected over the service period and reduced for estimated forfeitures.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans







 Note 13 Income Taxes



On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The Tax Act requires a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries payable over eight years. U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities were subject to remeasurement due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provided guidance on accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and a measurement period for companies to complete this accounting. Applied completed the accounting for the Tax Act during the measurement period, which ended one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act. Accounting for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, and the accounting for the transition tax was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.



The Tax Act also includes provisions that impact Applied starting in fiscal 2019, including a provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). On June 14, 2019, the U.S. government released regulations that significantly affect how the GILTI provision of the Tax Act is interpreted. As a result, Applied reversed a tax benefit of $96 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 that had been realized in the first half of fiscal 2019. An accounting policy choice is allowed to treat GILTI temporary differences in taxable income either as a current-period expense when incurred (period cost method) or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes (deferred method). Applied has chosen the period cost method.



Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. It is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings.



Applied’s effective tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 27.0 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was higher than the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the regulations released on June 14, 2019. 



Applied’s effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 17.3 percent and 35.2 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate was lower than the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to tax expense of $1.1 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 for the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act. Excluding the tax expense of $1.1 billion, the effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was higher than the rate in the same period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to certain provisions in the Tax Act becoming effective in fiscal 2019, tax expense of $79 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 related to changes in uncertain tax positions and the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 being $42 million less than in the same period in the prior fiscal year.



During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits related to certain tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns could be recognized in the amount of approximately $65 million as a result of negotiations with tax authorities and lapses of statutes of limitation.

Note 14Warranty, Guarantees and Contingencies 



Warranty







 Applied products are generally sold with a warranty for a 12-month period following installation. The provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is recognized. Parts and labor are covered under the terms of the warranty agreement. The warranty provision is based on historical experience by product, configuration and geographic region. Quarterly warranty consumption is generally associated with sales that occurred during the preceding four quarters, and quarterly warranty provisions are generally related to the current quarter’s sales.



Guarantees



In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of July 28, 2019, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $74 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.



Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of July 28, 2019, Applied has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $151 million to cover these arrangements.



Legal Matters



From time to time, Applied receives notification from third parties, including customers and suppliers, seeking indemnification, litigation support, payment of money or other actions by Applied in connection with claims made against them. In addition, from time to time, Applied receives notification from third parties claiming that Applied may be or is infringing or misusing their intellectual property or other rights. Applied also is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. 



Although the outcome of the above-described matters, claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not believe that any will have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Note 15Industry Segment Operations





The Semiconductor Systems reportable segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for etch, rapid thermal processing, deposition, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, wafer packaging, and ion implantation.



The Applied Global Services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and other products. 



The Display and Adjacent Markets segment includes products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays (LCDs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), equipment upgrades and flexible coating systems and other display technologies for TVs, monitors, laptops, personal computers, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices.



Each operating segment is separately managed and has separate financial results that are reviewed by Applied’s chief operating decision-maker. Each reportable segment contains closely related products that are unique to the particular segment. Segment operating income is determined based upon internal performance measures used by Applied’s chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker does not evaluate operating segments using total asset information.



Applied derives the segment results directly from its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies Applied uses to derive reportable segment results are substantially the same as those used for external reporting purposes. Management measures the performance of each reportable segment based upon several metrics including orders, net sales and operating income. Management uses these results to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings



The information set forth under “Legal Matters” in Note 14 in Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference.



Item 1A:Risk Factors



The risk factors set forth below include any material changes to, and supersede the description of, the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of Applied’s 2018 Form 10-K. These factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.



The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.



As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions. Applied’s industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment, and can have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations.



To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.



Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.





•uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands;



•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;



•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses, trade sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes;



•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;





•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;





•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs;



•delays or restrictions in shipping materials or finished products between countries;



•geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;



•supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, or other events beyond our control;



•a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;



•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;



•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel, Chinese yuan or Singapore dollar;



•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;



•performance of third party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities;



•political instability, natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;



•challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;



•the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and



•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.



International trade disputes could result in increases in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could have an adverse impact on our operations.



We sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside of the United States including China. We also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the United States. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions, and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 



Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses could potentially limit our markets and impact our business. In addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent a significant portion of Applied’s current business as well as long-term growth opportunities.



Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.



Uncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services, which may have an adverse impact on Applied’s revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.



Uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.



Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.



Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.



Applied’s customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation. Applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied’s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, gross margins and net income. Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. The concentration of Applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur additional bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied’s business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins. 



Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.





•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for Applied’s products;



•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;



•trade, regulatory or tax policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;



•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied operates;



•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;



•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;



•the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;



•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;



•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;



•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;



•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;



•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;



•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;



•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and



•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.



Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.





•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;



•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;



•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;



•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;



•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;



•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied’s products have lower relative market presence;



•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;



•semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;



•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;



•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;



•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;



•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of Applied’s foundry customers;



•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; 



•investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China and the United States; and



•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.



If Applied does not accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.



Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.





•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) and metal oxide transistor backplanes, flexible displays, and new touch panel films;



•the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;



•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China and the United States;



•the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;



•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and



•fluctuations in customer spending quarter over quarter and year over year for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.



If Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.



The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.





•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;



•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;



•differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;



•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;



•enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;



•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;



•effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;





•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;



•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;



•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;



•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and 



•implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.



If Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.



Applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.





•inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee (which, in the case of the stock purchase agreement related to the proposed acquisition of Kokusai Electric, Applied will be obligated to pay in the amount of $154 million if such agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals);



•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;



•contractual restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;



•the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;



•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;



•following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;



•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;



•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;



•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;



•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;



•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;



•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;



•increases in debt obligations, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;



•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;



•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;



•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;



•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and procedures, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;



•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;



•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;



•unknown, underestimated or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and



•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.



Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. In addition, new legislation or additional regulations may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.



Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.



Applied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). On June 14, 2019, the U.S. government released regulations that significantly affect how the GILTI provision of the Tax Act is interpreted. As a result, Applied reversed a tax benefit of $96 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 that had been realized in the first half of fiscal 2019. An increase in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition.



Consistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.



In addition, Applied is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.



Applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.



Applied has $5.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement as of July 28, 2019, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied’s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. 



Applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.





•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;



•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;



•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;



•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;



•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;



•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;



•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;



•new materials, processes and technologies;



•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;



•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;



•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;



•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;



•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and



•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.





Manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.





•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;



•volatility in the availability and cost of materials;



•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;



•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;



•information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider; and



•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied’s control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.





The ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.





Applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.



Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. Applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in U.S. patent laws, may impact Applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied’s intellectual property.



Third parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied’s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied’s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied’s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business and results of operations.



Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.



In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by Applied or third party providers. These data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. All information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation of intellectual property, and corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied’s and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied’s investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. Compliance with, and changes to, laws and regulations concerning privacy and information security could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against Applied by regulatory authorities or other third parties.



Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.



Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or has other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.



Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.



The failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact Applied’s business and results of operations.



Applied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth. Implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to Applied’s business operations. If Applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.



Applied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.



Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.



Applied is subject to risks associated with environmental and safety regulations.





Applied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.



As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied’s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, restrictions on Applied’s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
