 ﻿  



 ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION  



 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides a historical and prospective narrative on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. This interim MD&A should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in our 2017 Form 10-K. The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our 2017 Form 10-K, and as may be updated in our Forms 10-Q. Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of June 30, 2018.

 OVERVIEW  



 ﻿  



 Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework   



 ﻿  



 In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. The Framework outlines our leadership priorities and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses. We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. Under our Framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.   



 ﻿  



 Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities. Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms. This strategy allows us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.   



 ﻿  



 Summary of results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018  



 ﻿  



 Net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2,747 million and $5,247 million, compared to $2,497 million and $4,872 million, respectively, in the same periods in 2017, driven by an increase in net sales in all segments. The increase in both periods was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $141 million and $209 million, respectively, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North American and Europe, and an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in data centers. Environmental Technologies segment sales increased $54 million and $101 million, respectively, driven by higher sales of all products. Life Sciences sales increased by $24 million and $46 million, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product lines. Net sales in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments increased by $3 million and $6 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2018.

 ﻿  



   ·    An increase of $267 million in translated earnings contracts gains; 



   ·    The impact of discrete tax and other tax-related items in the amount of $49 million. These items include the release of a $28 million tax valuation reserve in the second quarter of 2018, combined with the absence of the tax impact related to the sale of investment securities and the write-off of a tax receivable due to settlement in the second quarter of 2017;  





   ·    Lower net income in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments, down $34 million and $6 million, respectively, slightly offset the items above. 



 ﻿  



 Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.36 per share, or 86%, when compared to the second quarter of 2017, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 24.6 million shares of common stock for approximately $674 million.  



 ﻿  





 ﻿  



   ·    A $103 million charge related to legal matters, including a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation matters; 



   ·    The preliminary agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to settle an audit in the amount of $172 million; 



   ·    Lower net income in the Display Technologies, Specialty Materials and All Other segments, down $94 million, $17 million and $30 million, respectively, and 



   ·    A decrease of $47 million in equity earnings, driven largely by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of long-term sales agreements with a customer of HSG. 



 ﻿  



 The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.  



 ﻿  





 ﻿  



 We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that segment net sales will reach approximately $11.3 billion, an increase from prior expectations of $11.0 billion. In our Display Technologies segment, we expect pricing to continue to improve, with year-over-year declines reaching mid-single digits in the third quarter, an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns. We anticipate Corning’s LCD glass volume will grow faster than the expected LCD glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China. In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase in the high-teen percentage range with organic growth improving by a low-teen percentage range with an additional $200 million from the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers. We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on new model launches and the adoption of our innovations. We are increasing our expectation of sales growth to the mid-teen percentage range in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and from the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters. We are increasing our expectations to mid-to-high single digit percentage growth in the Life Sciences segment.

 Income Before Income Taxes  



 The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.  



 ﻿  



 Provision for Income Taxes   





 ﻿  





 ﻿  





 ﻿  



   ·    A reduction in the estimated impact of the base erosion and anti-deferral tax (“BEAT”) attributable to year-to-date losses from foreign exchange and translated earnings contracts; 



   ·    Additional tax amounts related to global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”); and  



   ·    A $28 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable.  



 ﻿  





 ﻿  



   ·    Additional tax expense of $172 million related to a preliminary agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to settle the income tax audit for the years 2013 and 2014;

Comprehensive Income (Loss)  



 For the three months ended June 30, 2018 comprehensive income decreased by $154 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due to the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $382 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and the Korean won, partially offset by an increase in net income of $299 million.  



 ﻿  



 For the six months ended June 30, 2018 comprehensive (loss) income decreased by $1,044 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due to a decrease in net income of $376 million, the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $568 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and the Korean won, and a decrease in net unrealized gains of designated hedges of $62 million.  



 ﻿  



 Refer to Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  



 CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES  



 ﻿  



 In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at core performance measures. These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Additionally, Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and New Taiwan dollar currencies. The Company believes that the use of constant currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows. Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.   



 ﻿  



 These measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the Company’s outlooks for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan or New Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control. As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.  



 ﻿  



 See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for details on core performance measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below.

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures  



 We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.  



 ﻿  



 Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company’s operations.

 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS  



 ﻿  





 ﻿  



   ·    Display Technologies – manufactures glass substrates primarily for flat panel liquid crystal displays. 



   ·    Optical Communications – manufactures carrier and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry. 



   ·    Specialty Materials – manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs. 



   ·    Environmental Technologies – manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel emission control applications.  



   ·    Life Sciences – manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media and reagents enabling workflow solutions for scientific applications. 



 ﻿  



 All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.” This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies business and new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates.   





 ﻿  



 We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist the CODM in making internal operating decisions. We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.   



 ﻿  



 Display Technologies  





 ﻿  



 ﻿  





 ﻿  



 Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $3 million, and decreased by $34 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. LCD glass price declines essentially offset increased sales volume for the second quarter of 2018. Net sales decreased by $34 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, or 2%, primarily due to LCD glass price declines in the high single digits in percentage terms, partially offset by an increase in volume during the first quarter of 2018. The second quarter pricing environment was the most favorable in more than a decade.  



 ﻿  



 Net income in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $34 million and $94 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Increased manufacturing costs of $33 million and $45 million, respectively, driven by the impact of the start-up of our facility in Hefei, China were the primary driver of the decrease for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. Additionally, for the six months ended June 30, 2018, the glass price declines described above contributed to the decrease and were partially offset by increases in volume.   



 ﻿  





 In the third quarter, we expect the LCD glass market volume to grow mid-single digits sequentially, and for our volume to grow faster than the market. We expect third quarter sequential LCD price declines to again be moderate.

 Optical Communications  





 ﻿  



 ﻿  





 ﻿  



 Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased by $141 million, or 16%, and $209 million, or 12%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Higher sales of carrier products, up $96 million and $145 million, and enterprise network products, up $45 million and $64 million, respectively, drove the increase. Strong growth in the North American and European fiber-to-the-home and access markets drove the increase in carrier network products, and an increase in data centers drove the increase in enterprise network sales.  



 ﻿  



 Net income increased by $22 million, or 17%, and $21 million, or 9%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase was driven by the change in sales outlined above. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, volume gains were partially offset by costs associated with our planned capacity expansions.  



 ﻿  



 On June 1, 2018, Corning acquired substantially all of 3M’s Communications Market Division, results of which will be included in the Optical Communications segment. Net sales and net income had an insignificant impact on the results of this segment in the second quarter of 2018.  





 In the third quarter, Optical Communications sales are expected to increase by approximately 25% on a year-over-year basis, including the impact of the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division.  



 ﻿  



 Specialty Materials  





 ﻿  



 ﻿  





 ﻿  



 Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $6 million, or 2%, during the second quarter of 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018, decreased by $16 million, or 3%. Net income decreased by $6 million, or 9%, and $17 million, or 13% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily driven by development costs for new technology. Improvements in manufacturing efficiency partially offset the decline.  



 ﻿  





 In the third quarter of 2018, Specialty Materials sales are expected to increase approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis.  



 ﻿  



 Environmental Technologies

 Index  



Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased $54 million, or 21%, and $101 million, or 19%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Automotive product sales increased $30 million and $52 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, due to global market strength and continued sales growth of gas particulate filters. Diesel product sales increased $24 million and $49 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The increases were driven by higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Europe.  Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net sales in the amounts of $12 million and $32 million when compared to the corresponding three and six-month periods in 2017.  



 ﻿  



 Net income increased by $16 million, or 42%, and $24 million, or 29%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The increase was driven by the sales increase outlined above and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net income in the amounts of $1 million and $5 million when compared to the corresponding three and six-month periods in 2017.  



 ﻿  





 In the third quarter, we expect sales to increase in the high-teens in percentage terms on a year-over-year basis.  



 ﻿  



 ﻿  



 Life Sciences  





 ﻿  



 ﻿  





 ﻿  



 Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $24 million, or 11%, and $46 million, or 11%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, driven by higher sales in North America, Europe and China. Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net sales in the amount of $5 million and $14 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.  



 ﻿  



 Net income increased by $9 million, or 41%, and $12 million, or 26%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, driven by the increase in sales described above and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact net income in the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.  



 ﻿  





 Third-quarter sales are expected to increase by a mid-single digit percentage on a year-over-year basis.

 In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 24.6 million and 51.6 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $674 million and $1,488 million, respectively, as part of its 2016 Repurchase Program.   



 ﻿  



 Refer to Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) for additional information.  



 ﻿  



 Capital Spending  



 Capital spending totaled $1,177 million and $761 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect our 2018 capital expenditures to be slightly more than $2.0 billion, driven by expansions related to the Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility, the addition of capacity to support the new gas-particulate filters business in the Environmental Technologies segment and investment to support growth in customer demand in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments.  



 ﻿  



 Cash Flow   





 ﻿  





 ﻿  



 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $564 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, driven by customer deposits received of $576 million and the positive impact of changes in working capital of $215 million. A $62 million decline in dividends received from affiliated companies and non-cash adjustments partially offset these cash inflows.  



 ﻿  



 Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1,121 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, driven by the cash outflow of $794 million for the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, an increase of $416 million in capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansion projects in our Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Environmental Technologies segments and a decrease of $113 million in realized gains on translated earnings contracts. Cash received of $196 million, which represents the original fair value of the contingent consideration asset related to the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials (see Note 13), partially offset the net cash used in investing activities.  



 ﻿  



 Net cash used in financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased by $440 million when compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase of $438 million in share repurchases, debt repayments of $375 million and a decrease of $209 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $596 million partially offset the negative cash impact of these items.

 Management Assessment of Liquidity  



 We ended the first half of 2018 with approximately $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world, with approximately 70% held outside of the United States, and are generally unrestricted. We utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. In the first half of 2018, the Company distributed approximately $2.2 billion from its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent of those subsidiaries. There were no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with the respect to this distribution of cash.   



 ﻿  



 To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements. We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $850 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt. Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.   



 ﻿  



 Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $2 billion. Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company’s $2 billion revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.  



 ﻿  



 Other   



 We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.  



 ﻿  



 Our major source of funding for 2018 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.

Corning has access to a $2 billion unsecured committed revolving credit facility. This credit facility includes a leverage ratio financial covenant. The required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%. At June 30, 2018, our leverage using this measure was approximately 28%, and, as such, are in compliance with the financial covenant.  



 ﻿  



 Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all such provisions.  



 ﻿  



 Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  



 ﻿  



 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in our 2017 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first six months of 2018. For certain items, additional details are provided below.  



 ﻿  



 Impairment of Assets Held for Use  



 We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.  



 ﻿  



 Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets. This review considers all of the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support our manufacturing operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.  



 ﻿  



 At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $663 million and $711 million, respectively. These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments. Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments. The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments. Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments.

ENVIRONMENT  



 ﻿  



 Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Corning had accrued approximately $35 and $38 million, respectively, (undiscounted) for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.
