Overview





Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, we changed the composition of our Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers we serve. This resulted in the identification of new operating segments within Defense Solutions. In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments. While this activity did not have a material impact on the Company's reportable segments, prior year segments results have been recast to reflect this change. 



Business Environment and Trends 



U.S. Government Markets 



During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, we generated approximately 87% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government. Accordingly, our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending, especially on national security, homeland security and intelligence, and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the U.S. government.



In September 2018, Congress passed and the President signed a consolidated appropriations bill funding the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Health and Human Services for the full government fiscal year ("GFY") 2019. Earlier in 2018, funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Energy as well as funding for Congress were also enacted. All were funded at increased levels from the previous year. 



The remaining seven appropriations bills were operating under a continuing resolution ("CR") until it expired on December 21, 2018. From the expiration of that CR until the passage of a new CR on January 25, 2019 there was a partial U.S. government shutdown, which reduced or delayed work on existing contracts and caused delays in other government contracting actions and payments. Prior to the expiration of the January CR, Congress passed appropriations for the seven remaining appropriations bills, thereby completing funding for GFY 2019.



In March 2019, the President submitted the GFY 2020 budget proposal to Congress. The budget includes $750 billion for defense and $563 billion for non-defense spending. The defense budget proposal includes $576 billion for national defense and $165 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.



LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.



On July 22, 2019, the White House and Congress reached a tentative two-year budget deal to raise spending caps and suspend the debt ceiling until July 2021. Under the deal, allocations for national defense spending increases to $738 billion in GFY 2020 and to $741 billion in GFY 2021. For non-defense programs, spending increases to $632 billion in GFY 2020 and $635 billion in GFY 2021. Overall, the measure increases spending by $323 billion over the limits set under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Congress is now addressing the passage of the appropriations bills for GFY 2020.



International Markets



Sales to customers in international markets represented approximately 8% of total revenues for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in Australia and the U.K. Our international business increases our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory and geopolitical risks.



Recent changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials, may increase our procurement costs of certain IT hardware used both on our contracts and for internal use. However, we expect to recover certain portions of these higher tariffs through our cost-plus contracts. While we are still evaluating the impact of higher tariffs, currently, we do not expect tariffs to have a significant impact to our business.



Results of Operations







The increase in revenues in constant currency(1) for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, was 8.4% and 7.2%, as compared to an actual increase in revenues of 7.9% and 6.7%, respectively. The foreign currency impact was mainly attributable to adverse exchange rate movements in the British pound and Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar.

Segment and Corporate Results





The increase in revenues for the three months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the three months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily attributable to new awards, partially offset by the completion of certain contracts, lower net profit write-ups in the current quarter and adverse exchange rate movements in the Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar.



The increase in revenues for the six months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the six months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily attributable to new awards and a net increase in program volumes, partially offset by the completion of certain contracts, lower net profit write-ups in the current year and adverse exchange rate movements in the Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar.



The increase in operating income for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily due to new awards, partially offset by lower net profit write-ups in the current year. 





The increase in revenues for the three months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the three months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily attributable to new awards and a net increase in program volumes, partially offset by the impact of the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business during the three months ended March 29, 2019, lower net profit write-ups in the current quarter and adverse exchange rate movements in the British pound when compared to the U.S. dollar.

The increase in operating income for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily due to new awards and lower amortization of intangibles, partially offset by lower net profit write-ups in the current year.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.



The decrease in operating income for the three months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the three months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily attributable to reduced margins on awarded re-compete contracts and the completion of certain contracts.



The decrease in operating income for the six months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the six months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily attributable to the completion of certain contracts and reduced margins on awarded re-compete contracts, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses.





The decrease in operating loss for the six months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the six months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily attributable to lower integration and restructuring costs and an asset impairment charge in the prior year.



Non-Operating (Expense) Income, net



Non-operating expense, net of $31 million for the three months ended June 28, 2019 was consistent with the non-operating expense, net of $34 million for the three months ended June 29, 2018.



Non-operating income, net for the six months ended June 28, 2019 was $23 million as compared to non-operating expense, net of $68 million for the six months ended June 29, 2018. The $91 million increase was primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business.



Provision for Income Taxes



For the three months ended June 28, 2019, our effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 12.1% for the three months ended June 29, 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits recognized during the three months ended June 29, 2018, related to the anticipated sale of our commercial cybersecurity business.



For the six months ended June 28, 2019, our effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 14.8% for the six months ended June 29, 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits recognized during the three months ended June 29, 2018, related to the anticipated sale of our commercial cybersecurity business and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits.



Bookings and Backlog 



We recorded net bookings worth an estimated $3.0 billion and $6.2 billion during the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively, as compared to $3.4 billion and $5.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, respectively.



LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.







The decrease in backlog within the Civil segment was primarily due to $154 million related to the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business in the first quarter of 2019.



Backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by factors including modifications of contracts and foreign currency movements. Our total backlog consists of remaining performance obligations (see "Note 5–Revenues") and unexercised option periods.



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Overview



As of June 28, 2019, we had $660 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we have a secured revolving credit facility which can provide up to $750 million in additional borrowing, if required. As of June 28, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with related financial covenants.



At June 28, 2019, and December 28, 2018, we had outstanding debt of $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. We made principal payments on our long-term debt of $17 million and $48 million during the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively, and $27 million and $44 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, respectively. This activity included required quarterly principal payments on our senior secured term loans of $14 million and $41 million during the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively, and $16 million and $31 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, respectively. In April 2018, we made a required debt prepayment of $10 million on our senior secured term loans. The prepayment was a result of the annual excess cash flow calculation clause in our credit agreements. The notes outstanding as of June 28, 2019, contain financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of June 28, 2019. 



We paid dividends of $47 million and $101 million during the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively, and $51 million and $103 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, respectively.



For the next 12 months, we anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs, including servicing our debt, through cash generated from operations, available cash balances and, if needed, borrowings from our revolving credit facility. 



LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.



Summary of Cash Flows







Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $85 million for the three months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to less favorable timing of working capital changes and higher tax payments.



Net cash provided by operating activities increased $181 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher advance payments from customers, $24 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs, partially offset by higher payments for taxes and timing of interest payments.



Net cash provided by investing activities increased $330 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to proceeds of $267 million received for the disposition of our commercial cybersecurity business and sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition, partially offset by higher purchases of equipment and software. 



Net cash used in financing activities decreased $128 million for the three months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to $90 million of stock repurchases in the prior year quarter and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year quarter.



Net cash used in financing activities increased $78 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $111 million increase in stock repurchases, partially offset by $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



We have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business. We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds as described in "Note 20–Commitments" of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These arrangements have not had, and management does not believe it is likely that they will in the future have, a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, operations or financial condition. 



Commitments and Contingencies



We are subject to a number of reviews, investigations, claims, lawsuits, other uncertainties and future obligations related to our business. For a discussion of these items, see "Note 19–Contingencies" and "Note 20–Commitments" of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.



Critical Accounting Policies



There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies, estimates or judgments, other than our accounting policy on leases, during the period covered by this report from those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2018. We revised our accounting policy on leases in conjunction with our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 (see "Note 3–Significant Accounting Policies").

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.









On February 16, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in one or more open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase transactions. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements, compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness and other considerations. There is no assurance as to the number of shares that will be repurchased, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our Board of Directors' discretion.
