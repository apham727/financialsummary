ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with the consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2018. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and in Part II, Item 1A -“Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report. See also “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this report.



Overview





A large percentage of our products are ICs used in AC-DC power supplies, which convert the high-voltage AC from a wall outlet to the low-voltage DC required by most electronic devices. Power supplies incorporating our products are used with all manner of electronic products including mobile phones, computing and networking equipment, appliances, electronic utility meters, power tools, industrial controls, and lighting applications that utilize light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and “smart-home,” or “internet of things” applications such as networked thermostats, power strips and other building-automation and security devices.



We also offer high-voltage gate drivers – either standalone ICs or circuit boards containing ICs, electrical isolation components and other circuitry – used to operate high-voltage switches such as insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). These combinations of switches and drivers are used for power conversion in high-power applications (i.e., power levels ranging from a few kilowatts up to one gigawatt) such as industrial motors, solar- and wind-power systems, electric vehicles and high-voltage DC transmission systems.



Our products bring a number of important benefits to the power-conversion market compared with less advanced alternatives, including reduced component count and design complexity, smaller size, higher reliability and reduced time-to-market. Our products also improve the energy efficiency of power converters, helping our customers meet the increasingly stringent efficiency standards that have been adopted around the world for many electronic products, and improving the efficiency of renewable-energy systems, electric vehicles and other high-power applications.







Our market-penetration strategy also includes capitalizing on the importance of energy efficiency in the power conversion market. For example, our EcoSmart™ technology drastically reduces the amount of energy consumed by electronic products when they are not in use, helping our customers comply with regulations that seek to curb this so-called “standby” energy consumption. Also, our gate-driver products are critical components in energy-efficient DC motor drives, high-voltage DC transmission systems, renewable-energy installations and electric transportation applications.



•Increase the size of our addressable market. Prior to 2010 our addressable market consisted of AC-DC applications with up to about 50 watts of output, a served available market (“SAM”) opportunity of approximately $1.5 billion. Since that time we have expanded our SAM to approximately $3 billion through a variety of means. These include 



the introduction of products that enable us to address higher-power AC-DC applications (such as our Hiper™ product families, which address applications up to about 500 watts) and our entry into the gate-driver markets through the acquisition of CT-Concept Technologie AG in 2012. In 2016 we introduced the SCALE-iDriverTM family of gate-driver ICs, which enables us to address applications between approximately 10 kilowatts and 100 kilowatts, whereas previously our gate-driver products were primarily for applications above 100 kilowatts.



Also contributing to our SAM expansion has been the emergence of new applications within the power ranges that our products can address. For example, applications such as LED lighting, “smart” utility meters, battery-powered lawn equipment and bicycles, and USB power ports (installed alongside traditional AC wall outlets) can incorporate our products; the increased use of electronic intelligence and controls in consumer appliances has also enhanced our SAM. Finally, we have enhanced our SAM by increasing the level of integration of our products, which in turn increases their value. For example, our InnoSwitch™ ICs integrate circuitry from the secondary, or low-voltage, side of AC-DC power supplies, whereas earlier product families integrated circuitry only on the primary, or high-voltage side.



We intend to continue expanding our SAM in the years ahead through all of the means described above.



Our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuations. We plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of projected customer demand, which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. Customers typically may cancel or reschedule orders on short notice without significant penalty and, conversely, often place orders with very short lead times to delivery. Also, external factors such as global economic conditions and supply-chain dynamics can cause our operating results to be volatile. Furthermore, because our industry is intensely price-sensitive, our gross margin (gross profit divided by net revenues) is subject to change based on the relative pricing of solutions that compete with ours. Variations in product mix, end-market mix and customer mix can also cause our gross margin to fluctuate. Because we purchase a large percentage of our silicon wafers from foundries located in Japan, our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. Changes in the prices of raw materials used in our products, such as copper and gold, can also affect our gross margin. Although our wafer-fabrication and assembly operations are outsourced, as are most of our test operations, a portion of our production costs are fixed in nature. As a result, our unit costs and gross margin are impacted by the volume of units we produce.



Recent Results



Our net revenues were $109.5 million and $107.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $212.6 million and $212.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in net revenues for the three month period was due primarily to higher unit sales into the industrial end-market, driven mainly by growth in high-power gate-driver applications. Net revenues for the six-month period were flat compared with the prior-year period as growth in the industrial, computer and consumer end-markets was offset by lower sales into the communications end-market for cellphone-charger and residential-networking applications.



Our top ten customers, including distributors that resell to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers, accounted for approximately 59% and 58% of our net revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and approximately 57% of net revenues in each of the respective corresponding periods of 2017. Our top customer, a distributor of our products, accounted for approximately 14% and 15% of our net revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and approximately 16% and 17% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. International sales accounted for approximately 97% and 96% of our net revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and approximately 96% of net revenues in each of the respective corresponding periods of 2017.



Our gross margin was 51% and 50% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and 52% and 49% in the six months ended June 30, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increases in gross margin as compared with the same periods in the prior year were due primarily to a favorable change in end-market mix, with a greater percentage of revenues coming from higher-margin end-markets; cost-reduction efforts also contributed to the increases.



Total operating expenses were $40.6 million and $39.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $80.2 million and $76.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increases were due primarily to the expansion of our workforce and annual merit increases, resulting in higher salary and related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense; also contributing to the increases were higher product-development expenses in support of our product-development efforts and increased legal expenses related to our litigation with ON Semiconductor.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 



amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those listed below. We base our estimates on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ from those estimates.





•revenue recognition;



•stock-based compensation;



•estimating write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory;



•income taxes;



•business combinations; and



•goodwill and intangible assets.



Our critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in each case in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2018.



Results of Operations



The following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated.





Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017



Net revenues.  Net revenues consist of revenues from product sales, which are calculated net of returns and allowances. Net revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $109.5 million and $212.6 million, respectively, and $107.6 million and $212.3 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2017. The increase in net revenues for the three month period was due primarily to higher unit sales into the industrial end-market, driven mainly by growth in high-power gate-driver applications. Net revenues for the six-month period were flat compared with the prior-year period as growth in the industrial, computer and consumer end-markets was offset by lower sales into the communications end-market for cellphone-charger and residential-networking applications.







International sales, consisting of sales outside of the United States of America based on “bill to” customer locations, were $105.8 million and $205.0 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and $103.1 million and $203.9 million in the corresponding periods of 2017, respectively. Although power converters using our products are distributed to end markets worldwide, most are manufactured in Asia. As a result, sales to this region represented 79% and 78%, of our net revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and 78% and 79% of our net revenues in the corresponding periods of 2017, respectively. We expect international sales, and sales to the Asia region in particular, to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues in the future.



Sales to distributors accounted for 76% of net revenues in each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and 80% and 78% in the corresponding periods of 2017, respectively. Direct sales to OEMs and power-supply manufacturers accounted for the remainder.



In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, one customer, a distributor of our products, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues.







 No other customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in these periods.







The increases in gross margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared with the same periods in the prior year, was due primarily to a favorable change in end-market mix, with a greater percentage of revenues coming from higher-margin end-markets; cost-reduction efforts also contributed to the increases.

























The increases in other income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same periods in 2017, were due primarily to increases in interest income reflecting higher yields earned on our cash and investments.







In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the effective tax rate was lower than the then statutory federal income-tax rates of 21% and 35%, respectively, due to the geographic distribution of our world-wide earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, the impact of federal research tax credits, as well as the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments. Additionally, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the effective tax rate was impacted by the estimated 2018 GILTI tax.



Liquidity and Capital Resources



As of June 30, 2018, we had $246.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, a decrease of approximately $36.2 million from $282.9 million as of December 31, 2017. As of June 30, 2018, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $288.6 million, a decrease of approximately $24.9 million from $313.5 million as of December 31, 2017.



Operating activities generated cash of $42.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. Net income for this period was $29.6 million; we also incurred non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization of $11.7 million, $9.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Sources of cash also included a $9.9 million decrease in accounts receivable due to increased cash collections. These sources of cash were partially offset by an $11.7 million increase in inventory, reflecting anticipated demand, a $7.3 million decrease in accounts payable, excluding payables related to property and equipment, due primarily to the timing of payments, and a $1.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily driven by prepaid taxes and maintenance agreements.



Operating activities generated cash of $30.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. Net income for this period was $28.0 million; we also incurred non-cash stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses of $11.3 million, $8.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Sources of cash also included a $3.2 million increase in taxes payable and accrued liabilities. These sources of cash were partially offset by a $12.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased shipments, an $8.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and a $3.6 million decrease in accounts payable due primarily to the timing of payments.



Our investing activities provided $79.3 million of cash in the six months ended June 30, 2018, consisting of $90.4 million from sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by $10.5 million for purchases of property and equipment, primarily for manufacturing. Our investing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2017, resulted in a $56.3 million net use of cash, consisting of $33.4 million for purchases of marketable securities, net of maturities, and $22.9 million for purchases of property and equipment, primarily production-related machinery and equipment. 



Our financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2018, resulted in a $67.2 million net use of cash, consisting of $63.4 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $9.5 million for the payment of dividends to stockholders. These uses of cash were offset in part by $5.6 million from the issuance of common stock, including the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. Our financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2017, resulted in a $3.2 million net use of cash. Financing activities consisted of $8.3 million for the payment of dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $5.1 million from the issuance of common stock, including the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. 



On July 27, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement with a bank (the "Credit Agreement") that provides us with a $75.0 million revolving line of credit to use for general corporate purposes with a $20.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby and trade letters of credit. The Credit Agreement was amended on April 30, 2018, to extend the termination date from July 26, 2019, to April 30, 2022, with all other terms remaining the same. Our ability to borrow under the revolving line of credit is conditioned upon our compliance with specified covenants, including reporting and financial covenants, primarily a minimum liquidity measure and a debt to earnings ratio, with which we are currently in compliance. The Credit Agreement terminates on April 30, 2022; all advances under the revolving line of credit will become due on such date, or earlier in the event of a default. As of June 30, 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under our agreement.



In January 2017, our board of directors declared four cash dividends in the amount of $0.14 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2017. We paid a total of $16.6 million in cash dividends in 2017. In January 2018, our board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.16 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2018. Dividend payouts of approximately $4.8 million and $4.7 million occurred on March 30, 2018 and June 29, 2018, respectively. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.





As of June 30, 2018, we had a contractual obligation related to income tax, which consisted primarily of unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $18.4 million. A portion of the tax obligation is classified as long-term income taxes payable and a portion is recorded in deferred tax assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.



As of June 30, 2018, there were no material changes in our contractual commitments from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.





If our operating results deteriorate during the remainder of 2018 as a result of a decrease in customer demand, pricing pressure, or other factors, our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized. In that case, we may be forced to use our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, use our credit agreement or seek additional financing from third parties to fund our operations. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with existing sources of liquidity, will satisfy our projected working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.



Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements



As of June 30, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
