NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 





As permitted by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, these notes are condensed and do not contain all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). As a result of the adoption of ASC 842 "Leases," Cognex Corporation (the "Company") has provided new disclosures related to leases in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Reference should be made to the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a full description of other significant accounting policies.



In the opinion of the management of the Company, the accompanying consolidated unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal, recurring adjustments, and financial statement reclassifications necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 29, 2019, and the results of its operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, and changes in shareholders’ equity, comprehensive income, and cash flows for the periods presented.



The results disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.



Leases



The Company accounts for leases in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 842, "Leases." The core principle of ASC 842 is that a lessee should recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. 



At inception of a contract, the Company determines whether that contract is or contains a lease. The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease by assessing whether there is an identified asset and whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company has control of the asset if it has the right to direct the use of the asset and obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use. 



As a practical expedient, the Company does not recognize a lease asset or lease liability for leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. In the determination of the lease term, the Company considers the existence of extension or termination options and the probability of those options being exercised. 



Lease contracts may include lease components and non-lease components, such as common area maintenance and utilities for property leases. As a practical expedient, the Company accounts for the non-lease components together with the lease components as a single lease component for all of its leases. 







The lease liability equals the present value of the future cash payments discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term, which is the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a 2.5% credit risk spread.





Operating lease expense equals the total cash payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The amortization of the lease asset is calculated as the straight-line lease expense less the accretion of the interest on the lease liability each period. The lease liability is reduced by the cash payment less the interest each period.





Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Measurement of Credit Losses"



ASU 2016-13 applies to all reporting entities holding financial assets that are not accounted for at fair value through net income (debt securities). The amendments in this ASU eliminate the probable initial recognition threshold to recognize a credit loss under current U.S. GAAP and, instead, reflect an entity’s current estimate of all expected credit losses. In addition, this ASU broadens the information an entity must consider in developing the credit loss estimate, including the use of reasonable and supportable forecasted information. The amendments in this ASU require that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down and an entity will be able to record reversals of credit losses in current period net income. For public companies, the guidance in ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods. This ASU should be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. As of the date of this report, management is in the process of completing the implementation of this ASU, including finalizing the internal credit losses policy and the related processes, internal control, and disclosures. Management does not expect ASU 2016-13 to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures. 



Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-08, "Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs - Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities"



ASU 2017-08 applies to all reporting entities that hold investments in callable debt securities that have an amortized cost basis in excess of the amount that is repayable by the issuer at the earliest call date (that is, at a premium). The amendments in this ASU shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. Specifically, the amendments require the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity. Under current GAAP, premiums and discounts on callable debt securities generally are amortized to the maturity date. If that callable debt security is subsequently called, the entity records a loss equal to the unamortized premium. The amendments in this ASU more closely align the amortization period of premiums and discounts to expectations incorporated in market pricing on the underlying securities. For public companies, the amendments in ASU 2017-08 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim reporting periods within annual years beginning after December 15, 2020. This ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption, and, in the period of adoption, the entity is required to provide disclosures about the change in accounting principle. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Management does not expect ASU 2017-08 to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.



Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-15, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software"



ASU 2018-15 applies to entities that are a customer in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The amendments in this ASU align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. Accordingly, the amendments in this ASU require an entity in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. Further, it requires the entity to expense the capitalized implementation costs over the term of the hosting arrangement. In addition, it requires the presentation of the expenses related to the capitalized implementation costs in the same line item in the statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting element of the arrangement and the classification of the payments for the capitalized implementation costs in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as the payments made for the fees associated with the hosting element. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Management does not expect ASU 2018-15 to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 





Financial Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis







The Company’s money market instruments are reported at fair value based upon the daily market price for identical assets in active markets, and are therefore classified as Level 1. 



The Company’s debt securities and forward contracts are reported at fair value based upon model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, and are therefore classified as Level 2. Management is responsible for estimating the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities, and in doing so, considers valuations provided by a large, third-party pricing service. For debt securities, this service maintains regular contact with market makers, brokers, dealers, and analysts to gather information on market movement, direction, trends, and other specific data. They use this information to structure yield curves for various types of debt securities and arrive at the daily valuations. The Company's forward contracts are typically traded or executed in over-the-counter markets with a high degree of pricing transparency. The market participants are generally large commercial banks.



The Company did not record an other-than-temporary impairment of these financial assets during the three-month or nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018.



The Company's contingent consideration liabilities are reported at fair value based upon probability-adjusted present values of the consideration expected to be paid using significant inputs that are not observable in the market and are therefore classified as Level 3. Key assumptions used in these estimates include probability assessments with respect to the likelihood of achieving certain revenue milestones. The fair values of these contingent consideration liabilities were calculated using discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement, and are remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in "Other income (expense)" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.







Non-financial Assets that are Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis



Non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and intangible assets are required to be measured at fair value only when an impairment loss is recognized. The Company did not record an impairment charge related to these assets during the three-month or nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 







As of September 29, 2019, the Company did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment of these investments. In its evaluation, management considered the type of security, the credit rating of the security, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the size of the loss position, the Company's intent and ability to hold the security to expected recovery of value, and other meaningful information. The Company does not intend to sell, and is unlikely to be required to sell, any of these available-for-sale investments before their effective maturity or market price recovery.



The Company recorded gross realized gains and gross realized losses on the sale of debt securities totaling $361,000 and $67,000, respectively, during the three-month period ended September 29, 2019 and $283,000 and $17,000, respectively, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2018. The Company recorded gross realized gains and gross realized losses on the sale of debt securities totaling $818,000 and $103,000, respectively, during the nine-month period ended September 29, 2019 and $646,000 and $111,000, respectively, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018. These gains and losses are included in "Investment income" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to the sale of these securities, unrealized gains and losses for these debt securities, net of tax, are recorded in shareholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss.















On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, “Leases,” using the transition method of adoption, which allowed the Company to apply the standard on a prospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance sheet as of the adoption date. Accordingly, the Company recorded lease assets 





COGNEX CORPORATION 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 



of $17,522,000, current lease liabilities of $4,736,000, and non-current lease liabilities of $12,669,000 on its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019.





The Company's leases are primarily leased properties across different worldwide locations where the Company conducts its operations. All of these leases are classified as operating leases. Certain leases may contain options to extend or terminate the lease at the Company's sole discretion. There were no options to extend or terminate that were included in the determination of the lease term for the leases outstanding as of September 29, 2019. Certain leases contain leasehold improvement incentives, retirement obligations, escalating clauses, rent holidays, and variable payments tied to a consumer price index. There were no restrictions or covenants for the leases outstanding as of September 29, 2019.



The total operating lease expense for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 was $1,749,000 and $4,976,000, respectively. The total operating lease cash payments for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 was $1,708,000 and $4,778,000, respectively. The total lease expense for leases with a term of twelve months or less for which the Company elected not to recognize a lease asset or lease liability was $22,000 and $255,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019, respectively.







The discounted present value of the future lease cash payments resulted in a lease liability of $16,167,000 as of September 29, 2019.



The weighted-average discount rate was 4.8% for the leases outstanding as of September 29, 2019. The weighted-average remaining lease term was 3.6 years for the leases outstanding as of September 29, 2019. The Company did not have any leases that have not yet commenced but that create significant rights and obligations as of September 29, 2019. 



The Company owns a building adjacent to its corporate headquarters that is partially occupied with a tenant who has a lease agreement that will expire in 2022. Rental income was $76,000 and $77,000 for the three-month period ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively. Rental income was $234,000 and $236,000 for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively.

The Company records the estimated cost of fulfilling product warranties at the time of sale based upon historical costs to fulfill claims. Obligations may also be recorded subsequent to the time of sale whenever specific events or circumstances impacting product quality become known that would not have been taken into account using historical data. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers and third-party contract manufacturers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage, and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. An adverse change in any of these factors may result in the need for additional warranty provisions. Warranty obligations are included in “Accrued expenses” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.









The Company’s foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the potential financial impact of changes in the value of transactions and balances denominated in foreign currencies resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, the Company enters into economic hedges to manage this risk. The economic hedges utilize foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of up to 45 days to manage the exposure 





COGNEX CORPORATION 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 



to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising primarily from foreign-denominated receivables and payables. The gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to be offset by the changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities being hedged. These economic hedges are not designated as hedging instruments for hedge accounting treatment.

Costs to Fulfill a Contract



Costs to fulfill a contract are included in "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and amounted to $4,792,000 and $3,514,000 as of September 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.



Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets, and Contract Liabilities



Accounts receivable represent amounts billed and currently due from customers which are reported at their net estimated realizable value. The Company maintains reserves against its accounts receivable for potential credit losses. Credit losses recognized on accounts receivable were immaterial for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively. Contract assets consist of unbilled revenue which arises when revenue is recognized in advance of billing for certain application-specific customer solutions contracts. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and customer deposits which arise when amounts are billed to or collected from customers in advance of revenue recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company has elected not to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations, as our contracts have an original expected duration of less than one year.





The Company’s share-based payments that result in compensation expense consist of stock option grants and restricted stock units (RSUs). As of September 29, 2019, the Company had 17,350,152 shares available for grant. Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the Company’s common stock at the grant date and generally vest over four or five years based upon continuous service and expire ten years from the grant date. RSUs generally vest upon three years of continuous employment or incrementally over such three-year period. Participants are not entitled to dividends on RSUs. 



Stock Options







 (1) In addition to the vested options, the Company expects a portion of the unvested options to vest at some point in the future. Options expected to vest are calculated by applying an estimated forfeiture rate to the unvested options.









COGNEX CORPORATION 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 



Risk-free rate



The risk-free rate was based upon a treasury instrument whose term was consistent with the contractual term of the option.



Expected dividend yield



Generally, the current dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by the Company’s Board of Directors and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the grant date. 



Expected volatility



The expected volatility was based upon a combination of historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the contractual term of the option and implied volatility for traded options of the Company’s stock.



Expected term



The expected term was derived from the binomial lattice model from the impact of events that trigger exercises over time.



The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted during the three-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 were $18.42 and $22.52, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted during the nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 were $18.58 and $21.70, respectively. 



The total intrinsic values of stock options exercised for the three-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 were $5,746,000 and $17,985,000, respectively. The total intrinsic values of stock options exercised for the nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 were $42,545,000 and $50,975,000, respectively. The total fair values of stock options vested for the three-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 were $1,213,000 and $997,000, respectively. The total fair values of stock options vested for the nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 were $32,072,000 and $27,557,000, respectively. 



Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)



The fair values of RSUs granted were determined based upon the market value of the Company's common stock at the time of grant. The initial cost was then amortized over the period of vesting until the restrictions lapsed. 







The weighted-average grant-date fair values of RSUs granted during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 were $45.20. There were no RSUs vested for the three or nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019. There were no RSUs granted or vested in 2018.



Stock-Based Compensation Expense





As of September 29, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock awards, including stock options and RSUs, was $59,708,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.60 years.





COGNEX CORPORATION 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 



The total stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit recognized for the three-month period ended September 29, 2019 were $10,194,000 and $1,804,000, respectively, and for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 were $9,143,000 and $1,654,000, respectively. The total stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit recognized for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2019 were $33,442,000 and $5,839,000, respectively, and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 were $31,339,000 and $5,608,000, respectively. No compensation expense was capitalized as of September 29, 2019 or December 31, 2018.









In October 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $200,000,000 of the Company's common stock. As of September 29, 2019, the Company repurchased 1,601,000 shares at a cost of $70,312,000 under this program, including 1,398,000 shares at a cost of $61,690,000 during the nine-month period ended September 29, 2019. The Company may repurchase shares under this program in future periods, up to the remaining balance of $129,688,000, depending upon a variety of factors, including, among other things, the impact of dilution from employee stock options, stock price, share availability, and cash requirements.









Management has determined that earnings from its legal entity in China will be indefinitely reinvested to provide sufficient local funding for growth, and that earnings from all other jurisdictions will not be indefinitely reinvested. The Company is tax resident in numerous jurisdictions around the world and has identified its major tax jurisdictions as the United 





COGNEX CORPORATION 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 



States, Ireland, and China. The statutory tax rate is 12.5% in Ireland and 25% in China, compared to the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21%. International rights to certain of the Company's intellectual property are held by a subsidiary whose legal jurisdiction does not tax this income, resulting in a foreign effective tax rate that is lower than the above mentioned statutory rates, although the reduced taxes overseas have been partially offset by changes in U.S. tax law. These differences resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate by 7 percentage points for all periods presented.



The excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate by 1 and 4 percentage points for the three-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively, and a decrease in the effective tax rate by 3 and 5 percentage points for the nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively. 



During the nine-month period ended September 29, 2019, the Company recorded a $37,000 increase in reserves for income taxes, net of deferred tax benefit. Estimated interest and penalties included in these amounts totaled $50,000 for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2019.



The Company’s reserve for income taxes, including gross interest and penalties, was $8,179,000 as of September 29, 2019, which included $7,151,000 classified as a non-current liability and $1,028,000 recorded as a reduction to non-current deferred tax assets. The amount of gross interest and penalties included in these balances was $918,000. If the Company’s tax positions were sustained or the statutes of limitations related to certain positions expired, these reserves would be released and income tax expense would be reduced in a future period. As a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations, there is a potential that a portion of these reserves could be released, which would decrease income tax expense by approximately $1,300,000 to $1,400,000 over the next twelve months.



The Company has defined its major tax jurisdictions as the United States, Ireland, and China, and within the United States, Massachusetts. Within the United States, the tax years 2016 through 2018 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and various state tax authorities. The tax years 2015 through 2018 remain open to examination by various taxing authorities in other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. 









Equity awards to purchase 6,078,000 and 5,695,000 shares of common stock, on a weighted-average basis, were outstanding during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2019, respectively, and 2,796,000 and 2,353,000 for the same periods in 2018, but were not included in the calculation of dilutive net income per share because they were anti-dilutive.





On October 16, 2019, the Company acquired Sualab Co., Ltd. (Sualab), a provider of deep learning-based vision software for industrial image analysis based in Korea for approximately $195 million. The total consideration included cash payments of approximately $171 million upon closing. The remaining consideration consists of deferred payments of approximately $24 million that may become payable on the fourth anniversary date of the closing, contingent upon the continued employment of key talent, and will be recorded as compensation expense over this four-year period. Given the timing of this acquisition, the Company is in the process of completing the purchase price allocation for the $171 million of consideration that is not related to employment. Transaction costs incurred to date were not material and were expensed as incurred. The financial results of Sualab prior to the acquisition date are not material to the consolidated financial results of the Company.



On October 28, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.055 per share. The dividend is payable on November 29, 2019 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 15, 2019. 





ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



Various claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened on behalf of or against the Company. While we cannot predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that any liability arising from them will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.



ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS



For a list of factors that could affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition, see the risk factors discussion provided in Part I—Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
