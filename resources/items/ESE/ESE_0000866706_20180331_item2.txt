ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 



References to the second quarters of 2018 and 2017 represent the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 



OVERVIEW 



In the second quarter of 2018, sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $174.8 million, $10.0 million and $0.38 per share, respectively, compared to $161.2 million, $11.2 million and $0.43 per share, respectively, in the second quarter of 2017. In the first six months of 2018, sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $348.3 million, $44.7 million and $1.72, respectively, compared to $307.5 million, $21.9 million and $0.84 per share, respectively, in the first six months of 2017. 



NET SALES 



Net sales increased $13.6 million, or 8.4%, to $174.8 million in the second quarter of 2018 from $161.2 million in the second quarter of 2017. Net sales increased $40.8 million, or 13.2%, to $348.3 million in the first six months of 2018 from $307.5 million in the first six months of 2017. The increase in net sales in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to the second quarter of 2017 was due to a $14.0 million increase in the USG segment, a $2.4 million increase in the Test segment and a $0.3 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment, partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in the Filtration segment. The increase in net sales in the first six months of 2018 as compared to the corresponding prior year period was due to a $34.3 million increase in the USG segment, a $6.2 million increase in the Test segment and a $2.2 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in the Filtration segment. 



-Filtration 







-Test 



In the second quarter of 2018, net sales of $40.8 million were $2.4 million, or 6.3%, higher than the $38.4 million recorded in the second quarter of 2017. Net sales increased $6.1 million, or 8.4%, to $78.3 million in the first six months of 2018 from $72.2 million in the first six months of 2017. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to higher sales from the segment’s U.S. operations due to the timing of test and measurement chamber projects. 



-Utility Solutions Group (USG) 



Net sales increased $14.0 million, or 42.8%, to $46.7 million in the second quarter of 2018 from $32.7 million in the second quarter of 2017. Net sales increased $34.3 million, or 50.3%, to $102.5 million in the first six months of 2018 from $68.2 million in the first six months of 2017. The increase in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was mainly due to the sales contributions from the NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard Instruments (Vanguard) acquisitions. The increase in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 was mainly due to the sales contributions from NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard and new products and software solutions at Doble. 



-Technical Packaging 



In the second quarter of 2018, net sales of $21.5 million were $0.3 million, or 1.4%, higher than the $21.2 million in the second quarter of 2017. Net sales increased $2.3 million, or 5.8%, to $41.7 million in the first six months of 2018 from $39.4 million in the first six months of 2017. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to the increase in net sales from Plastique due to increased shipments to new customers as well as fluctuations in currency. 



ORDERS AND BACKLOG 



Backlog was $416.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $377.1 million at September 30, 2017. The Company received new orders totaling $187.3 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $166.9 million in the second quarter of 2017. Of the new orders received in the second quarter of 2018, $67.8 million related to Filtration products, $48.1 million related to Test products, $52.5 million related to USG products, and $18.9 million related to Technical Packaging products. Of the new orders received in the second quarter of 2017, $62.0 million related to Filtration products, $44.2 million related to Test products, $33.0 million related to USG products, and $27.6 million related to Technical Packaging products. 



The Company received new orders totaling $387.8 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to $349.8 million in the first six months of 2017. Of the new orders received in the first six months of 2018, $133.2 million related to Filtration products, $106.4 million related to Test products, $110.1 million related to USG products, and $38.1 million related to Technical Packaging products.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 







AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS 



Amortization of intangible assets was $4.6 million and $9.0 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $3.8 million and $7.5 million for the corresponding periods of 2017. Amortization expenses consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily software). The increase in amortization expense in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was mainly due to an increase in amortization of intangibles related to the Morgan Schaffer, NRG and Mayday acquisitions. 



OTHER EXPENSES (INCOME), NET 



Other expenses, net, was $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to other income, net, of $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2017. The principal components in other expenses, net, in the second quarter of 2018 were $2.1 million of charges primarily related to the USG segment restructuring activities, including the Doble facility consolidations, partially offset by gains on derivative instruments. The restructuring charges mainly related to severance and compensation benefits, professional fees and asset impairment charges related to abandoned assets. There were no individually significant items in other (income) expenses, net, in the second quarter of 2017. 



Other expenses, net, was $1.6 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to other income, net, of $1.3 million in the first six months of 2017. The principal components in other expenses, net, in the first six months of 2018 were $2.1 million of charges related to the USG segment restructuring activities as mentioned above, partially offset by gains on derivative instruments. The principal component in other income, net, in the first six months of 2017 was $0.4 million of income related to death benefit insurance proceeds from a former subsidiary.  



EBIT 



The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on EBIT, and provides EBIT on a consolidated basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, above. EBIT was $15.6 million (8.9% of net sales) for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $17.7 million (11.0% of net sales) for the second quarter of 2017. For the first six months of 2018, EBIT was $30.6 million (8.8% of net sales) compared to $34.5 million (11.2% of net sales) for the first six months of 2017. 



The following table presents a reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings. 





-Filtration 





-Test 



EBIT in the second quarter of 2018 was $5.3 million (13.0% of net sales) compared to $3.8 million (9.8% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first six months of 2018 was $7.9 million (10.1% of net sales) compared to $6.2 million (8.6% of net sales) in the first six months of 2017. The increase in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods was primarily due to the increased sales volumes mainly from the segment’s U.S. operations. 





-Utility Solutions Group 



EBIT in the second quarter of 2018 was $5.6 million (12.0% of net sales) compared to $7.4 million (22.8% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first six months of 2018 was $16.3 million (15.9% of net sales) compared to EBIT of $17.1 million (25.1% of net sales) in the first six months of 2017. The decrease in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was mainly due to the restructuring charges incurred in the second quarter of 2018 and product mix. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company incurred $1.9 million of charges related to closing the Doble facilities in Norway and China consisting mainly of employee severance and compensation benefits, professional fees, and asset impairment charges. 



-Technical Packaging 



EBIT in the second quarter of 2018 was $1.9 million (8.8% of net sales) compared to $2.2 million (10.3% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first six months of 2018 was $2.9 million (6.8% of net sales) compared to $3.2 million (8.2% of net sales) in the first six months of 2017. The decrease in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was mainly due to product mix at Plastique including lower margin projects. 



-Corporate 



Corporate costs included in EBIT were $8.3 million and $17.2 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $7.3 million and $14.4 million in the corresponding periods of 2017. The increase in Corporate costs in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to higher professional fees and an increase in amortization of intangible assets related to recent acquisitions. 



INTEREST EXPENSE, NET 



Interest expense was $2.0 million and $4.2 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, and $0.9 million and $1.5 million in the corresponding periods of 2017. The increase in interest expense in the first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding period of 2017 was mainly due to higher average outstanding borrowings ($264 million compared to $167 million) and higher average interest rates (2.9% vs. 1.8%) as a result of the additional borrowings to fund the Company’s recent acquisitions. 



INCOME TAX EXPENSE 





In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $2.3 million provisional estimate of the income tax effects of the future repatriation of the cumulative earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which unfavorably impacted the year-to-date effective tax rate by 8.9%. An additional $7.5 million pension contribution for the 2017 plan year was approved increasing the value of the deferred tax liability by $1.0 million (provisional amount). This favorable adjustment, net of the $0.3 million unfavorable impact to the 2017 Domestic Production Deduction, favorably impacted the second quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 5.8% and 3.0%, respectively. The income tax expense in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was also unfavorably impacted by the cancellation of debt income triggered by the dissolution of a foreign subsidiary increasing the second quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 1.5% and 0.8%, respectively. 



In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded reasonable estimates of the TCJA income tax effects. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company was unable to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740 for the change in the value of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as it needs more time to collect and analyze information primarily related to depreciation expense, pension liability (see provisional adjustment described above), and percentage of completion revenue recognition. The accounting for these items will be completed within the allotted measurement period. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company collected and analyzed some of the additional information needed to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740 for the income tax effects of subjecting the Company’s cumulative foreign earnings to federal income tax and as described above recorded a $0.7 million adjustment. This amount remains provisional as the Company needs more time to collect and analyze the remaining information to compute the cumulative balance of earnings subject to the tax and the amount of foreign tax credit that is available to offset the tax. 



Since the TCJA subjected the Company’s cumulative foreign earnings to U.S. tax, repatriation of those earnings generally provides that no additional federal tax will be imposed. However, the permissible amount of repatriation can be restricted by local law and a repatriation can result in tax expense due to local country withholding tax, U.S. state tax, and changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company is evaluating these considerations to determine the amount of its foreign subsidiaries’ cumulative earnings it intends to indefinitely reinvest. 



The TCJA includes a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”). The Company expects it will be subject to this tax. At its January 10, 2018 meeting, the FASB staff indicated that companies should make and disclose a policy election as to whether they will recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI or whether they will account for GILTI as period costs if and when incurred. Because there are interpretative questions associated with the approach that involves recognizing deferred taxes, the Company is in the process of evaluating and will make the accounting policy election during the SAB 118 measurement period. 



TCJA moved the U.S. to a federal tax system that will no longer tax dividends from foreign corporations to U.S. corporations. The cost of transitioning to this new tax system is a deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings, the “Foreign Earnings Toll Charge”, the estimated tax cost of which was recorded in the first quarter and trued up during the second quarter of 2018. The actual repatriation of foreign earnings triggers foreign dividend withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes, the estimated cost of which was recorded in the first quarter and trued up during the second quarter of 2018. 



During the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, there were no material changes in the unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate a material change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. 





CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 



The Company’s overall financial position and liquidity remains strong. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased to $205.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $197.8 million at September 30, 2017. Inventories increased by $12.5 million during this period mainly due to a $6.2 million increase within the Filtration segment primarily to support new aerospace platforms and a $4.1 million increase within the USG segment. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on long-term contracts decreased $7.0 million in the first six months of 2018 due to ETS-Lindgren ($4.7 million) and VACCO ($2.3 million). 



Net cash provided by operating activities was $33.0 million and $36.7 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2018 as compared to the first six months of 2017 was due to higher working capital requirements. 



Capital expenditures were $10.1 million and $15.4 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the first six months of 2018 was mainly due to a decrease in machinery and equipment at Plastique ($3.0 million) and VACCO ($1.6 million). In addition, the Company incurred expenditures for capitalized software of $4.6 million and $3.4 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. 



Credit Facility 



At March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $176 million available to borrow under its bank credit facility, a $250 million increase option, and $42.9 million cash on hand. At March 31, 2018, the Company had $265 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility in addition to outstanding letters of credit of $9.1 million. Cash flow from operations and borrowings under the Company’s credit facility are expected to meet the Company’s capital requirements and operational needs for the foreseeable future. The Company’s ability to access the additional $250 million increase option of the credit facility is subject to acceptance by participating or other outside banks. 



New Accounting Standards 



In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which updates ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits. This update permits only the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement expense to be reported with other compensation costs, while all other components are required to be reported separately in other deductions, outside any subtotal of operating income. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted on a retrospective basis. The updates change presentation only and will not impact the Company’s results of operations. 



In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities, which updates ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. This update is intended to amend the hedge accounting model to enable entities to better align the economics of risk management activities and financial reporting. The updates eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. These updates are not expected to materially impact the Company’s results of operations. 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-062, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This standard will increase an entities’ reported assets and liabilities. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition period for all entities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 



In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This guidance has been further clarified and amended. The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has selected the Cumulative Effect method of transition to the new standard. 



Acquisitions 



On March 14, 2018, the Company acquired the assets of Manta Test Systems Inc. (Manta), a North American utility solutions provider located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, for a purchase price of $9.5 million in cash. Manta has annualized sales of approximately $8 million. Since the date of acquisition, the operating results for Manta have been included as a product line of Doble within the Company’s USG segment. 



During the second quarter of 2018, the Company paid a deferred payment of $1.6 million in connection with the 2016 acquisition of Plastique. 



Dividends 



A dividend of $0.08 per share, totaling $2.1 million, was paid on October 17, 2017 to stockholders of record as of October 3, 2017. A dividend of $0.08 per share, totaling $2.1 million, was paid on January 19, 2018 to stockholders of record as of January 4, 2018. Subsequent to March 31, 2018, a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, totaling $2.1 million, was paid on April 18, 2018 to stockholders of record as of April 3, 2018. 



OUTLOOK 



Management’s current expectations for 2018 remain consistent with the details outlined in the Business Outlook presented in the Company’s February 6, 2018 release. 



On a quarterly basis, Management continues to expect 2018 revenues and EPS to reflect a profile similar to 2017, including EPS being more second-half weighted. Third quarter 2018 EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.73 per share. Management expects 2018 GAAP EPS in the range of $3.55 to $3.65 per share and Adjusted EPS in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 per share, adjusting for the first quarter 2018 incremental net tax benefits resulting from U.S. Tax Reform and the second quarter 2018 cost reduction charges in the USG and Filtration segments. 





CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 



Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements and related notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. Certain of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by Management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on historical experience, trends in the industry, information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. The most significant areas involving Management judgments and estimates may be found in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis and in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. 



OTHER MATTERS 



Contingencies 



As a normal incident of the business in which the Company is engaged, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against the Company. Additionally, the Company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation relating to environmental matters. In the opinion of Management, the aggregate costs involved in the resolution of these matters, and final judgments, if any, which might be rendered against the Company, are adequately reserved, are covered by insurance, or would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results from operations, capital expenditures, or competitive position.
