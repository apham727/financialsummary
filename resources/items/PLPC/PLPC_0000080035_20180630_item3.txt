ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 



The Company operates manufacturing facilities and offices around the world and uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance the Company’s global operations. As a result, the Company is subject to business risks inherent in non-U.S. activities, including political and economic uncertainty, import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company believes that the political and economic risks related to the Company’s international operations are mitigated due to the geographic diversity in which the Company’s international operations are located. 



As of June 30, 2018, the Company had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 







The Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate revolving credit facilities and term notes, which consisted of borrowings of $41.5 million at June 30, 2018. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
