ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 



The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018. 



We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2019” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2019. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. 



We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. 



Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 



This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to: 



•Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. 



•Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. 



•If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 





•The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. 



•Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 



•Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies. 



•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 



•As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.



•Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.  



•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. 



•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. 



•If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 



•Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. 



•We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. 



•If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. 



•Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. 





•Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. 



•We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. 



•We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. 



•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders. 



For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 



Overview 



Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. 



Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, U.K. pound and Japanese yen. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results.



As previously announced, on January 10, 2019, Pierre Nanterme stepped down as our chairman and chief executive officer and as a director for health reasons. Effective January 10, 2019, the Board of Directors appointed David Rowland, who was serving as our chief financial officer, as the interim chief executive officer and a director of Accenture, and KC McClure, who was serving as our managing director—Finance Operations, as our chief financial officer, and named our lead independent director, Marge Magner, as the non-executive chair of the board. We subsequently announced the passing of Mr. Nanterme on January 31, 2019.



Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). In connection with the adoption, we present total revenues and no longer report revenues before reimbursements (net revenues). This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 



Summary of Results









As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in 



favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4% and 3% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2019, we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.







Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), which required us to reclassify certain components of pension costs from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 



Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 29.2%, compared with 28.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was 30.2% compared with 29.9% for the six months ended February 28, 2018. The increase in gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower labor costs, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was primarily due to lower non-payroll costs, compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.



Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 15.8% for the six months ended February 28, 2019, compared with 15.8% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and six months ended February 28, 2018. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the recognition of share-based compensation upon the previously disclosed vesting and settlement of our former chairman and chief executive officer’s restricted share units in connection with his resignation for health reasons during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. For the six months ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 20 basis points, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points.



Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 13.3%, compared with 13.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was 14.3%, compared with 14.1% for the six months ended February 28, 2018. 



Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740). Upon adoption, we recorded deferred tax assets of $2.1 billion, and we will recognize incremental income tax expense going forward as these deferred tax assets are utilized. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 



The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 were 17.1% and 18.6%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 were 26.1% and 23.0%, respectively. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Absent this charge, our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 15.1% and 18.0%, respectively. For additional information see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. 



Diluted earnings per share were $1.73 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared with $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Diluted earnings per share were $3.69 for the six months ended February 28, 2019, compared with $3.16 for the six months ended February 28, 2018. The tax charge decreased fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share by $0.21 in both the second quarter and six months ended February 28, 2018. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.58 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $3.37 for the six months ended February 28, 2018. 



We have presented effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of the tax charge in fiscal 2018, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impact of the charge and our financial performance. 



New Bookings 



New bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were $11.8 billion, with consulting bookings of $6.7 billion and outsourcing bookings of $5.1 billion. New bookings for the six months ended February 28, 2019 were $22.0 billion, with consulting bookings of $12.6 billion and outsourcing bookings of $9.3 billion.

Cost of services for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $350 million, or 5%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.8% from 71.1% during this period. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased to 29.2% from 28.9% during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.



Sales and Marketing 



Sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $21 million, or 2%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.8% from 10.1% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. 



General and Administrative Costs 



General and administrative costs for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $83 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.2% from 5.7% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher share-based compensation as discussed in the Overview. 



Operating Income and Operating Margin 



Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $91 million, or 7%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2018. 







Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 









•Financial Services operating income decreased as higher consulting contract profitability and revenue growth were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.





•Products operating income was relatively flat year-over-year as revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.



•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.



Other Income (Expense), net 



Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, other expense decreased $33 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower net foreign exchange losses. 



Provision for Income Taxes 



The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 17.1%, compared with 26.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million tax charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 would have been 15.1%. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2019 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments and higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16, partially offset by a decrease in prior year tax liabilities. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 



Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 



Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $40 million, or 71%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. 



Earnings Per Share 



Diluted earnings per share were $1.73 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared with $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The $0.36 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million tax charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.21. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.15 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2018, due to an increase of $0.12 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.05 from lower non-operating expense and $0.02 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.04 from a higher effective tax rate. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 



Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended February 28, 2019 Compared to the Six Months Ended February 28, 2018

Cost of Services 



Cost of services for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased $838 million, or 6%, over the six months ended February 28, 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 69.8% from 70.1% during this period. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased to 30.2% from 29.9% during the six months ended February 28, 2018. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower non-payroll costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. 



Sales and Marketing 



Sales and marketing expense for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased $90 million, or 5%, over the six months ended February 28, 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.9% from 10.1% during this period. 



General and Administrative Costs 



General and administrative costs for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased $117 million, or 10%, over the six months ended February 28, 2018, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 5.9% from 5.7% during this period.

•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. 



•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability. 



Provision for Income Taxes 



The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was 18.6%, compared with 23.0% for the six months ended February 28, 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million tax charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 18.0%. The higher effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments and higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16, partially offset by higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 



Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2019 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. 



Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 



Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the six months ended February 28, 2019 decreased $88 million, or 73%, from the six months ended February 28, 2018 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. 



Earnings Per Share 



Diluted earnings per share were $3.69 for the six months ended February 28, 2019, compared with $3.16 for the six months ended February 28, 2018. The $0.53 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million tax charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2018 by $0.21. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased $0.32 compared with the six months ended February 28, 2018, due to an increase of $0.28 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.03 from lower non-operating expenses and $0.03 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.02 from a higher effective tax rate.For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



As of February 28, 2019, Cash and cash equivalents was $4.5 billion, compared with $5.1 billion as of August 31, 2018. 









Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 









We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 



Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. 



Borrowing Facilities 







Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $386 million of letters of credit outstanding as of February 28, 2019.



Share Purchases and Redemptions 



The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. 















Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 



In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. 



To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 



New Accounting Pronouncements and Significant Accounting Policies 



See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) and Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Note 2 includes updates to our revenue policy as result of the implementation of FASB ASU No. 2014-09.
