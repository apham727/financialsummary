Executive Summary 



For the first quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $417.8 million compared to $285.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $132.4 million, or 46.4%. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS along with higher volume across all three segments. Net sales for Electronics increased $110.6 million, or 72.0%, due to the acquisition of IXYS and U.S. Sensor and strong growth across all the business units and geographic regions. Net sales for the Automotive segment increased $18.3 million, or 17.0% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units and geographic regions. Net sales in the Industrial segment increased $3.4 million or 14.4% due to volume growth in the power fuse and relay businesses. The Company recognized net income of $36.0 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $38.9 million, or $1.69 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in net income reflects the impact of the acquisition and integration related costs of $39.5 million associated with the IXYS acquisition that were mostly offset by operating income increases across all three segments and foreign exchange gains. Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 1.5 million as a result of the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.  



Net cash provided by operating activities was $69.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $22.9 million for the three months ended April 1, 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs. 



On January 17, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of IXYS for total purchase consideration of $778.8 million, net of cash acquired. IXYS is a global pioneer in the power semiconductor and integrated circuit markets with a focus on medium to high voltage power control semiconductors across the industrial, communications, consumer and medical markets. IXYS has a broad customer base, serving more than 3,500 customers through its direct salesforce and global distribution partners. 



Results of Operations  



The following table summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the periods presented. The first quarter of 2018 includes $39.5 million of non-segment charges. The charges related to the IXYS acquisition total $38.6 million and include $17.9 million of purchase accounting inventory charges, $11.7 million in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses associated with the acquisition of IXYS, $4.5 million of stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior services periods $2.5 million in backlog amortization costs and $2.1 million in other charges. In addition, there were $0.8 million of restructuring charges related to certain operations in the Electronics segment. 



The first quarter of 2017 includes approximately $1.5 million of non-segment charges. These were primarily attributable to acquisition-related costs primarily related to legal and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisitions in 2016 of the ON Portfolio and PolySwitch.

Net Sales 



Net sales increased $132.4 million, or 46.4%, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 with increases of $86.3 million and $3.1 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S Sensor acquisitions, respectively. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher volume across all businesses in the Electronics segment and Automotive segments as well as increases in the fuse and relay businesses in the Industrial segment. 



Gross Profit 



Gross profit was $149.6 million, or 35.8% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $113.7 million, or 39.8% of net sales in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in gross profit reflects the lower gross profit of the IXYS acquisition and volume growth and expense leverage across all segments. The decrease in gross margin is due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $17.9 million which negatively impacted the first quarter of 2018 gross margin by 4.3 percentage points. 



Operating Expenses 



Total operating expenses were $112.1 million, or 26.8% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $64.8 million, or 22.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in operating expenses of $47.3 million is primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the IXYS and US Sensor acquisitions as well as higher acquisition-related and integration costs of $20.1 million and an increase in amortization expense of $6.1 million resulting from the acquisition of IXYS.

Operating Income 



Operating income was $37.6 million, a decrease of $11.3 million or 23.1% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $48.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $17.9 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the IXYS acquisition as described above. Operating margins decreased from 17.1% in the first quarter of 2017 to 9.0% in the first quarter of 2018. The higher acquisition and integration charges negatively impacted operating margins by 9.0% in the first quarter of 2018.  



Income Before Income Taxes 



Income before income taxes was $44.6 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $47.4 million, or 16.6% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income, income before income taxes was impacted by favorable comparative foreign exchange gains that were partially offset by increased interest expense associated with the increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition. The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on various foreign currency transactions worldwide was approximately $10.6 million of unrealized income for the first quarter of 2018 compared to income of unrealized $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to fluctuations in the euro and Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar. Interest expense increased $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily reflecting increased borrowings. Additionally, other income increased by $1.9 million as a result of unrealized investment gains, primarily associated with our investment in Polytronics. 



Income Taxes 



Income tax expense was $8.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 19.3%, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $8.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 18.0%, for the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 was lower than the then applicable 35% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions. 



Segment Results of Operations 









Electronics Segment 



The Electronics segment net sales increased $110.6 million, or 72.0%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions of $86.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, higher volume across all businesses driven by the strong electronics cycle and favorable foreign exchange impacts of $5.3 million. 



Automotive Segment  



The Automotive segment net sales increased $18.3 million, or 17.0%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to increased volume across all businesses with the commercial vehicle business having the most growth as well as favorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $7.4 million. 





Table of Contents  



Industrial Segment  



The Industrial segment net sales increased $3.4 million, or 14.4%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher volume in the power fuse and relay operations partially offset by lower volume in the custom products business. 



Geographic Net Sales Information

Asia-Pacific  



Asia-Pacific net sales increased $50.8 million, or 39.5%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to incremental net sales from current year and prior year acquisitions and higher net sales in all of the Electronics and Automotive segments’ businesses as well as favorable foreign currency effects of $3.1 million. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



The Company has historically supported its liquidity needs through cash flows from operations. Management expects that the Company’s (i) current level of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, (ii) current and forecasted cash flows from operations, (iii) availability under existing funding arrangements, and (iv) access to capital in the capital markets will provide sufficient funds to support the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, investments, and debt obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis. 





On March 4, 2016, the Company entered into a new five-year credit agreement with a group of lenders for up to $700.0 million. The new credit agreement consists of an unsecured revolving credit facility of $575.0 million and an unsecured term loan credit facility of up to $125.0 million. In addition, the Company has the ability, from time to time, to increase the size of the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility by up to an additional $150.0 million, in the aggregate, in each case in minimum increments of $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of participating lenders.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities 



Operating cash inflows are largely attributable to sales of the Company’s products. Operating cash outflows are largely attributable to recurring expenditures for raw materials, labor, rent, interest, taxes and other operating activities. 



Net cash provided by operating activities was $69.3 million for the first three months of 2018, compared to $22.9 million during the three months ended April 1, 2017.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 



The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures. The assumptions, estimates, and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends, and other factors the Company believes are relevant at the time it prepares the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 





Recent Accounting Pronouncements 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases" (Topic 842). This ASU requires lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases of greater than twelve months. The accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition. The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02. 



In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") provisions in the Tax Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred taxes related to GILTI inclusions or treating any taxes on GILTI inclusions as period cost are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election. The Company has not yet completed its assessment and therefore has not yet elected an accounting policy.
