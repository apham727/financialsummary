Item 4. Controls and Procedures



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, and pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company’s management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.



Change in Internal Controls. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We implemented internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition on our financial statements to facilitate their adoption on October 1, 2018. There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new standard.
