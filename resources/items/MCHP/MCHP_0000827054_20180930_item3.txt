Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk



As of September 30, 2018, our long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled $12.31 billion. We have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $6.49 billion as of September 30, 2018. We do have interest rate exposure with respect to the $5.83 billion balance of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2018. A 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately $29.2 million.
