Item 1. Legal Proceedings



We are defendants in various lawsuits or arbitration proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes, based on the opinion of legal counsel and other factors, that the aggregated liabilities, if any, arising from such actions will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and the cash flows of the Company.



Item 1A. Risk Factors



There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed under Item 1A. of the Companyâ€™s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.



The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
