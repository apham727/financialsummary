We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (“PC”s), and mobile devices.
The terms “Activision Blizzard,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A, and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi S.A., we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc.
In 2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie, Inc. (“Bungie”) to publish games in the Destiny franchise.
Effective December 31, 2018, Activision and Bungie mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise.
Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products.
King’s games are free to play; however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or real currency, and we continue to focus on in-game advertising as a growing source of additional revenue.
•the Activision Blizzard Distribution (“Distribution”) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.
We monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business.
Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others.
Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.
In-game net bookings primarily includes the net amount of downloadable content and microtransactions sold during the period, and is equal to in-game net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.

Q3 2019 vs. Q3 2018
The decrease in in-game net bookings for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in Blizzard and Activision in-game net bookings of $183 million and $113 million, respectively, due to the same drivers discussed for net bookings above.
YTD Q3 2019 vs. YTD Q3 2018
MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month.
We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period.
An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users.
For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.
Average MAUs decreased by 11 million, or 3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in average MAUs for King.
The decrease in King’s average MAUs is primarily due to decreases from the Candy Crush franchise.
The slight increase in Blizzard’s average MAUs is due to an increase in average MAUs for World of Warcraft, largely offset by lower average MAUs for Hearthstone.
Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry.
Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 18% annually from 2015 to 2018.
The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.
Additionally, we have sold the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League.
The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry.
According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 38% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2018.
For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for 58% of our consolidated net revenues—and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income—for 2018.
Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year.
This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement.
Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.

On February 12, 2019, the Company committed to a Board-authorized restructuring plan under which the Company aims to refocus its resources on its largest opportunities and remove unnecessary levels of complexity and duplication from certain parts of the business.
Since the roll out of the plan, we have been, and will continue focusing on these goals.
The restructuring and related costs incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, relate primarily to severance costs, write-downs of lease facility assets, and the write-downs of other assets that will no longer be used.

•an $11 million increase in interest income due to our cash and cash equivalent balances earning interest at higher rates, along with an overall higher cash balance, in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as potential dividend payments or share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $913 million, as compared to $791 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments and lower cash spent to support the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018).
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $79 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $160 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to $153 million of cash proceeds from the maturities of available-for-sale investments, as compared to purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million in the prior-year period.
Additionally, capital expenditures of $79 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, were lower than the capital expenditures of $97 million for the prior-year period.
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.
Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $251 million, as compared to $2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $24 million on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to a negative impact of $15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
On February 12, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per common share.
On May 9, 2019, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $283 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 28, 2019.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, capital expenditures were $79 million.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were no significant changes to the above critical accounting policies and estimates.
