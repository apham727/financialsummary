The Initial Decision described the basis for issuing a transfer pricing assessment of approximately 3.5kr billion (approximately $379 million), primarily concerning an alleged intercompany asset transfer.
On June 17, 2019, we received a reassessment from the STA (“Reassessment”) which changed the Initial Decision based on a revision of the transfer pricing approach reflected in King’s 2016 Swedish tax return and removal of the alleged intercompany asset transfer that was the basis of the Initial Decision.
The STA also, at the same time, reassessed the 2017 tax year on the same transfer pricing basis as 2016.
