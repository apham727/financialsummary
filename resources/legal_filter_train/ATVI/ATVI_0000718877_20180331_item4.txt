Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, at March 31, 2018, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During the first quarter of 2018, we implemented internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of the new accounting standard related to revenue recognition on our financial statements to facilitate their adoption. There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard.
