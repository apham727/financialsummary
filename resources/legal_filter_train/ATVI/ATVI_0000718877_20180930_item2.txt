Item 2.
We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (PC), and mobile devices.
The terms Activision Blizzard, the Company, we, us, and our are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992.
In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi), and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc.
The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol ATVI.
We have also established a long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny.
Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products.
Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net®, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content.
Blizzard also includes the activities of the Overwatch LeagueTM, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and our Major League Gaming (MLG) business, which is responsible for various esports events and serves as a multi-platform network for Activision Blizzard esports content.
Kings games are free to play, however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or directly using real currency.
· the Activision Blizzard Distribution (Distribution) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
The Companys financial results for 2018 are presented in accordance with a new revenue accounting standard that was adopted in the first quarter of 2018.
Prior period results have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting standards.
Further information about our adoption of the new standard is provided in Notes 2 and 3 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
· consolidated net revenues decreased 7% to $1.51 billion, while consolidated operating income increased 3% to $265 million, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $1.62 billion and consolidated operating income of $257 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017;
· revenues from digital online channels were $1.28 billion, or 84% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $1.35 billion, or 84% of consolidated net revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2017;
· consolidated net income increased 38% to $260 million, as compared to $188 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017; net income for the 2018 period included $72 million of net tax benefits from discrete tax items primarily related to updates to our accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S.
· consolidated net revenues increased 3% to $5.12 billion, and consolidated operating income increased 19% to $1.29 billion, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $4.97 billion and consolidated operating income of $1.09 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017;
· revenues from digital online channels were $4.00 billion, or 78% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $4.05 billion, or 81% of consolidated net revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017;
· operating margin was 25.3%, as compared to 21.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017;
· diluted earnings per common share increased 35% to $1.51, as compared to $1.12 for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.
We monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business.
Net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others.
Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.
· lower net bookings from Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, which was released in June 2017 on the PlayStation 4 platform, and in June 2018 on the Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017
· lower net bookings due to fewer content releases in 2018 from our Diablo and Bubble Witch franchises as compared to 2017.
We monitor monthly active users (MAUs) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base.
MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month.
We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period.
An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users.
For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.
Average MAUs decreased by 7 million, or 2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The sequential decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to minor decreases across franchises from less engaged users leaving the network.
Average MAUs decreased by 39 million, or 10%, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017.
The year-over-year decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to decreases across Kings franchises from less engaged users leaving the network.
The year-over-year decrease in Blizzards average MAUs is due to lower MAUs for Hearthstone and Overwatch.
Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry.
Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry grew, on average, 18% from 2014 to 2017.
The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.
Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on the mobile platform has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home.
Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than both console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate.
King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises.
These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products.
As part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, which completed its inaugural season in July 2018.
During 2018, we have completed the sale of eight additional teams, which are expected to compete in the leagues second season.
The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry.
According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 36% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2017.
For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for 66% of our consolidated net revenuesand a significantly higher percentage of our operating incomefor 2017.
The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises.
The top 10 console franchises in 2017 were all established franchises.
Similarly, according to U.S. rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence, as of December 2017, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of 22 months.
In 2014, we released Hearthstone and Destiny; in 2015, we released Heroes of the Storm; and in 2016, we released Overwatch.
Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year.
This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement.
Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017
· an increase of $81 million in revenues from King, primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchises increased monetization, primarily through in-game features and events.
The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $164 million in revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to lower revenues recognized from Overwatch, partially offset by revenues from the Overwatch League, which started its inaugural regular season in January 2018.
The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $229 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to lower net deferrals of revenues from the Destiny franchise, as a result of lower net deferrals for Forsaken, the third expansion to Destiny 2, which was released in September 2018, as compared to net deferrals for the full game release of Destiny 2 in September 2017.
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017
The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $470 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to higher net deferred revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, driven by Destiny 2, and its associated in-game content, with no comparable release in 2016.
Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $14 million and a positive impact of $146 million on our consolidated net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year.
We do not aggregate operating segments.

The increase in Blizzards net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to the same drivers and partially offsetting factors as those for the three months ended September 30, 2018 discussed above, in addition to lower revenues from the Diablo franchise due to the release of Rise of the Necromancer, a downloadable content pack for Diablo III, which was released in June 2017, with no comparable release in 2018.
The decrease in Kings net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to decreases in revenues across various title offerings.
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017
The increase in Kings net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchises increased monetization, primarily through in-game features and events.
The increase was partially offset by lower revenues from the Bubble Witch franchise due to the release of Bubble Witch 3 Saga at the beginning of 2017, with no comparable release in 2018.

The decrease in Kings operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to lower revenues, as discussed above, partially offset by lower digital storefront fees (e.g.
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017
Kings operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was comparable to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to higher revenues, as discussed above, offset by higher marketing and product development costs for King franchises.
Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $16 million and a positive impact of $92 million on reportable segment net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year.

The decrease in net revenues from the PC platform for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to lower revenues recognized from Overwatch, partially offset by revenues recognized from Destiny 2, which was released on the PC platform in October 2017, and its associated in-game content, with no comparable release in 2016.
The decrease in net revenues from mobile and ancillary for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to decreases in revenues across various title offerings by King.

The decrease in product costs for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was in-line with the decrease in product sales, partially offset by higher product sales from our lower margin distribution business.
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017
The decrease in product costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $11 million in product costs from Activision, primarily related to there being no title releases for the Guitar Hero and Skylanders franchises, largely offset by higher product costs from our lower margin distribution business driven by increased product sales.
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017
The increase in game operations and distribution costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to higher personnel, facilities, and equipment costs of $52 million associated with our online games and broadcasting operations.
The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $11 million in software amortization and royalties from Activision, primarily due to the software amortization and royalties from expansion releases on Destiny 2.
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017
The increase in product development costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a $102 million increase in personnel and external developer costs to support existing and upcoming title releases.
The decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $76 million in amortization of the customer base intangible asset acquired as part of our acquisition of King, as the asset was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2018.
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017
The decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $187 million in amortization of the customer base intangible asset acquired as part of our acquisition of King, as the asset was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2018.
The decrease was partially offset by a $30 million increase in marketing spending and personnel costs, primarily associated with the Candy Crush franchise, World of Warcraft, and the Overwatch League, the last of which started its inaugural regular season in January 2018, partially offset by (1) reduced marketing costs for the Destiny franchise, due to lower marketing for Forsaken, the third expansion to Destiny 2, which was released in September 2018, as compared to marketing for the full game release of Destiny 2 in September 2017, and (2) reduced marketing costs for the Bubble Witch franchise, as Bubble Witch 3 SagaTM was released during the first quarter of 2017, with no comparable release in 2018.
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017
The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a $12 million increase in interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and higher interest rates compared to the prior-year period.
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017
The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a $35 million increase in interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and higher interest rates as compared to the prior-year period.
The income tax benefit of $48 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, reflects an effective tax rate of (23)%, which is lower than the effective tax rate of 15% for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
On June 27, 2018, the Company entered into the Closing Agreement.
The primary adjustments related to the Closing Agreement that were recognized in the second quarter of 2018 were a tax expense of $70 million and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million.
On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
SAB 118 enables companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete.
In addition, as of December 31.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company obtained additional information, including adjustments related to the Closing Agreement, and the evaluation of the impact of changing our indefinite reinvestment assertion, which affected the provisional amount initially recorded for the U.S. Tax Reform Act in the fourth quarter of 2017.
We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths.
Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.
Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $791 million, as compared to $1.06 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments.
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.
Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $160 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $163 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The decrease in the cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $80 million in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher capital expenditures of $97 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $86 million in the prior-year period.
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.
· higher dividends paid of $259 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $226 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $15 million on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a positive impact of $72 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.
· on August 24, 2018, we also entered a Seventh Amendment (the Amendment) to our Credit Agreement for which the Amendment, among other things replaced our prior revolving credit facility of $250 million with a new revolving credit facility with commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, which is scheduled to mature on August 24, 2023.
On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share.
On May 9, 2018, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $259 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018.
For the year ending December 31, 2018, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $125 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, capital expenditures were $97 million.
Below are recently issued accounting pronouncements that were most significant to our accounting policy activities.
For a detailed discussion of all relevant recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 3 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
As discussed in Note 2 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and on January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (collectively, the new revenue accounting standard), utilizing the modified retrospective method.
Additionally, we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date.
We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
Under the prior accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements was required.
· The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements.
While the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows.
The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.
Therefore, restricted cash will be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively.
We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented.
The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition.
Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows.
In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for derivatives and hedging.
We adopted the standard during the first quarter of 2018.
The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic.
The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases.
Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting.
The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments.
The asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments.
Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern.
The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
In July 2018, the FASB issued guidance to provide for an optional adoption method that allows companies to use the effective date of the new lease standard as the initial date of application on transition, and therefore does not require prior periods to be restated.
As part of our evaluation process, we have established a project implementation team that is evaluating our lease portfolio and system solutions, as well as identifying required process and policy changes, which include consideration of internal controls.
We have made progress in gathering the necessary data elements for our lease population, have selected a system provider, and system configuration and implementation is underway.
We do not plan to early adopt this new standard but do expect to elect and apply the available transition practical expedients, including the optional adoption method discussed above.
