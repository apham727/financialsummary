Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (PC), and mobile devices. We also operate esports events and leagues and create film and television content based on our intellectual property. The terms Activision Blizzard, the Company, we, us, and our are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi), and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. 
The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol ATVI. 
· the Activision Blizzard Distribution (Distribution) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware. 
· consolidated net revenues decreased 7% to $1.51 billion, while consolidated operating income increased 3% to $265 million, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $1.62 billion and consolidated operating income of $257 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017; 
· revenues from digital online channels were $1.28 billion, or 84% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $1.35 billion, or 84% of consolidated net revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2017; 
· consolidated net revenues increased 3% to $5.12 billion, and consolidated operating income increased 19% to $1.29 billion, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $4.97 billion and consolidated operating income of $1.09 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017; 
· revenues from digital online channels were $4.00 billion, or 78% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $4.05 billion, or 81% of consolidated net revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017; 
· operating margin was 25.3%, as compared to 21.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017;

Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year. Net revenues and operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2018, include a net effect of $146 million and $89 million, respectively, from the deferral of net revenues and related cost of revenues. Net revenues and operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, include a net effect of $692 million and $468 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues. 
The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. 
· lower net bookings from Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, which was released in June 2017 on the PlayStation 4 platform, and in June 2018 on the Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms. 
YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017 
· lower net bookings due to fewer content releases in 2018 from our Diablo and Bubble Witch franchises as compared to 2017. 
We monitor monthly active users (MAUs) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user. 
Average MAUs decreased by 7 million, or 2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018. The sequential decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to minor decreases across franchises from less engaged users leaving the network. 
Average MAUs decreased by 39 million, or 10%, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017. The year-over-year decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to decreases across Kings franchises from less engaged users leaving the network. King MAUs were also negatively impacted by technical system changes in the prior quarter made by some third-party partners in response to data initiatives, which inadvertently impacted some users ability to play and spend money in King games. The year-over-year decrease in Blizzards average MAUs is due to lower MAUs for Hearthstone and Overwatch. 
Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry grew, on average, 18% from 2014 to 2017. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment. 
Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on the mobile platform has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than both console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises. 
As part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, which completed its inaugural season in July 2018. During 2018, we have completed the sale of eight additional teams, which are expected to compete in the leagues second season. 
The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry. According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 36% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2017. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games were responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for 66% of our consolidated net revenuesand a significantly higher percentage of our operating incomefor 2017. 
The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. The top 10 console franchises in 2017 were all established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S. rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence, as of December 2017, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of 22 months. 
Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.

YTD Q3 2018 vs. YTD Q3 2017 
The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a $35 million increase in interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and higher interest rates as compared to the prior-year period. 
We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.4 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $791 million, as compared to $1.06 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments. The decrease was partially offset by higher net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. 
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions. 
Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $160 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $163 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in the cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $80 million in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher capital expenditures of $97 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $86 million in the prior-year period. 
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends. 
· higher dividends paid of $259 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $226 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. 
· on August 24, 2018, we also entered a Seventh Amendment (the Amendment) to our Credit Agreement for which the Amendment, among other things replaced our prior revolving credit facility of $250 million with a new revolving credit facility with commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, which is scheduled to mature on August 24, 2023. 
On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. On May 9, 2018, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $259 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018. 
For the year ending December 31, 2018, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $125 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, capital expenditures were $97 million. 
As discussed in Note 2 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and on January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (collectively, the new revenue accounting standard), utilizing the modified retrospective method. Additionally, we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date. For contracts that were modified before the period of adoption, we elected to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications when (1) identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (2) determining the transaction price, and (3) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018 was $88 million. 
· The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements. While the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements. 
In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively. 
We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. 
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. When the new standard was initially issued, it was required to be adopted using a modified retrospective transition that required application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, subject to certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in connection with the adoption. In July 2018, the FASB issued guidance to provide for an optional adoption method that allows companies to use the effective date of the new lease standard as the initial date of application on transition, and therefore does not require prior periods to be restated.
