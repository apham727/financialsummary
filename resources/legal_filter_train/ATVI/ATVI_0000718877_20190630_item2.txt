We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (“PC”s), and mobile devices.
The terms “Activision Blizzard,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A, and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi S.A., we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc.
Activision Publishing, Inc. (“Activision”), is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platform.
Activision’s key product franchise is Call of Duty®, a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms.
In 2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie, Inc. (“Bungie”) to publish games in the Destiny franchise.
Effective December 31, 2018, Activision and Bungie mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise.
Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise.
Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products.
King’s games are free to play; however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or real currency, and we continue to focus on in-game advertising as a growing source of additional revenue.
•the Activision Blizzard Distribution (“Distribution”) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, Activision released CrashTM Team Racing Nitro-Fueled and Blizzard released the latest expansion to Hearthstone—Rise of ShadowsTM.
The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.
We monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business.
Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others.
Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.

MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month.
We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period.
An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users.
For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.
Average MAUs decreased by 18 million, or 5%, for the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in average MAUs for King and Activision.
The decrease in King’s average MAUs is primarily due to decreases from the Candy Crush franchise.
The decrease in Activision’s average MAUs is primarily due to decreases from the Call of Duty franchise.
Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry.
Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 18% annually from 2015 to 2018.
The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.
The wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable audience for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home.
Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than console and PC gaming, and continues to grow at a significant rate.
King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises.
For example, as part of our efforts to take advantage of esports opportunities, during 2017, we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League, which concluded its inaugural season in July 2018.
During 2018, we also completed the sale of eight additional teams for the Overwatch League, which are competing in the league’s second season that began in February 2019.
Additionally, we have sold the first eight teams for our professional Call of Duty city-based league.
The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry.
According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 38% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2018.
For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for 58% of our consolidated net revenues—and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income—for 2018.
For example, in 2014, we released Hearthstone, and in 2016, we released Overwatch.
Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year.
This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement.
Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.

The increase is primarily due to the factors discussed above for the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018.
We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths.
Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019, was $604 million, as compared to $538 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments and lower cash spent to support the Destiny franchise, the publishing rights to which we sold to Bungie in December 2018, as previously disclosed.
This increase was partially offset by lower net income and a decrease in non-cash adjustments to net income for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019, was $37 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $124 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to cash flow activities associated with available-for-sale investments, for which, in the six months ended June 30, 2019, there were $75 million of cash proceeds from the maturities of available-for-sale investments, as compared to purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million in the prior-year period.
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.
The increase was partially offset by lower tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units of $48 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $68 million for the prior-year period.
Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $3 million on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to a negative impact of $19 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.
On February 12, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per common share.
On May 9, 2019, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $283 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 28, 2019.
For the year ending December 31, 2019, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $140 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, capital expenditures were $45 million.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, there were no significant changes to the above critical accounting policies and estimates.
Below are recently issued accounting pronouncements that were most significant to our accounting policy activities.
For a detailed discussion of all relevant recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 3 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
As noted in Note 2 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we adopted the new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019.
We elected to apply an optional adoption method, which uses the effective date as the initial date of application on transition with no retrospective adjustments to prior periods.
