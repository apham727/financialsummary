Please see the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” immediately preceding Part 1 for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.
This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The industry in which we operate is dynamic and highly competitive, and we expect it to remain so in the future.
Competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue.
There are also large, cloud-based service companies who innovate quickly and serve small businesses and consumers.
In recent years the widespread availability of the Internet, the emergence of mobile devices, and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that people throughout the world manage important financial tasks.
Our Consumer offerings have significant seasonal patterns.
As a result, during each of the last three fiscal years the total consolidated revenue for our third quarter ended April 30 has represented nearly half of our annual total consolidated revenue for those years.
To remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
As we continue transitioning to offer more connected services, the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important.
Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data.
information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
We implemented additional security measures in our products and began working with state governments to share information regarding suspicious filings while continuing to share such information with the federal government.
We continue to invest in security and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.
Total credit and debit card transaction volume correlates strongly with the macroeconomic environment and is one of the key drivers of revenue growth in our payment processing business.
Customers for our connected services offerings have generally grown faster than those for our traditional desktop software offerings, reflecting our strategic focus on connected services over the past few years.
Connected services (total service and other revenue) generated $3.8 billion or 73% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017.
We ended the first nine months of fiscal 2018 with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.9 billion.
We believe that there were no significant changes in those critical accounting policies and estimates during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and their disclosure in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the Audit and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors.
Operating income increased 12% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the same quarter of fiscal 2017.
The increase was due to the higher revenue described above partially offset by higher costs for advertising and other marketing programs, staffing, outside services, and share-based compensation.
See “Operating Expenses” later in this Item 2 for more information.
Net income increased 24% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the same quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the increase in operating income described above and a lower effective tax rate in the fiscal 2018 period, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act).
Diluted net income per share increased 24% to $4.59, in line with the increase in net income.
The increase was due to the higher revenue described above partially offset by higher costs for staffing, advertising and other marketing programs, outside services, and share-based compensation.
See “Operating Expenses” later in this Item 2 for more information.
Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased 23% due to the increase in operating income described above and a lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2018, as a result of the Tax Act.
Diluted net income per share increased 23% to $4.47, in line with the increase in net income.
The information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments.
See “Executive Overview – About Intuit” earlier in this Item 2 and Note 10 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information.
International total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.
Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses.
See “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 2 for a description of the seasonality of our business.
These unallocated costs totaled $1.1 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and $979 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
Segment expenses also do not include amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.
See Note 10 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for reconciliations of total segment operating income or loss to consolidated operating income or loss for each fiscal period presented.
We calculate revenue growth rates and segment operating margin figures using dollars in thousands.
Product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Desktop software products, including Desktop Pro, Desktop for Mac, Desktop Premier, and Enterprise; QuickBooks Basic Payroll and QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll; QuickBooks Point of Sale solutions; ProAdvisor Program memberships for the accounting professionals who serve small businesses; and financial supplies.

Online Ecosystem revenue increased 41% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 39% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
The revenue growth in both periods was driven by customer acquisition.
Online Services revenue increased 27% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and increased 21% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 due to customer growth in online payroll and payments.
Desktop Ecosystem revenue increased 3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 7% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
The increase in revenue in both periods was driven by growth in QuickBooks Enterprise subscribers and average revenue per customer.
Product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax desktop tax return preparation software.
Service and other revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax Online tax return preparation services and electronic tax filing services.
Total Consumer segment revenue increased $305 million or 14% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared with the same period of fiscal 2017 due to a higher average revenue per customer, a 4% growth in TurboTax federal units, and a shift in mix to our higher end product offerings.
Segment operating income increased 14% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 due to higher revenue which was partially offset by higher expenses including staffing, advertising, and other marketing programs.
Product revenue is derived primarily from Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProFile desktop tax preparation software products.
Service and other revenue is derived primarily from ProConnect Tax Online tax return preparation, bank products, and related services that complement the tax return preparation process.
The Strategic Partner segment targets professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing.
Segment operating income increased 8% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 primarily due to the higher revenue and relatively stable spending.
Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue was consistent in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared with the same periods of fiscal 2017.
Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue was consistent in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared with the same periods of fiscal 2017.
Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue was flat in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2017.
Total net revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $384 million or 15% while total operating expenses for the quarter increased $146 million or 17%.
Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue was flat in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period of fiscal 2017.
Total net revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased $641 million or 15% while total operating expenses for that period increased $348 million or 15%.
Operating expenses increased about $130 million for higher staffing expenses due to higher headcount, $108 million for advertising and other marketing programs, and $44 million for outside services.
The effective date of the tax rate change was January 1, 2018.
With our fiscal year ending July 31, the change will result in a blended lower U.S. statutory federal rate of 26.9% for fiscal year 2018.
As a result, we adjusted our annual effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018, as well as adjusted our U.S. net deferred tax asset balance at the lower rates.
During the three months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded an additional provisional charge of $5 million related to the re-measurement of deferred tax balances, resulting in a total tax expense of $44 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2018.
On December 22, 2017 the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance for companies that are not able to complete their accounting for the income tax effects of the Act in the period of enactment.
The guidance allows us to record provisional amounts to the extent a reasonable estimate can be made and provides us with up to one year from enactment date to finalize accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act.
Since the Tax Act was passed in Intuit’s second quarter, the deferred tax re-measurements and other items are considered provisional due to the forthcoming guidance and ongoing analysis of the final year-end data and tax positions.
The analysis is expected to be completed within the 12-month measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.
For the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $8 million and $41 million in our provision for income taxes.
Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 was approximately 26% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 26.9%.
See Note 7 to the financial statements in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report for more information.
Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2017 were approximately 33% and 31%.
See Note 7 to the financial statements in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report for more information.
At April 30, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.9 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion from July 31, 2017 due to the factors discussed under “Statements of Cash Flows” below.
Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facility.
Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and debt repayment, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends.
As discussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 2, our business is subject to significant seasonality.
The balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern.
Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $1.9 billion at April 30, 2018.
None of those funds were restricted and approximately 87% of those funds were located in the U.S. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases.
Our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these types of opportunities.
Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months.
We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.
The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.
See the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for complete statements of cash flows for those periods.
As described in Note 8 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized.
At April 30, 2018, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $1.2 billion for stock repurchases.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2018 we also continued to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our outstanding common stock.
In May 2018 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per share of outstanding common stock payable on July 18, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 10, 2018.
On February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion.
Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times.
Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%.
Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings.
We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility.
We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.
We may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate.
The term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.125% to 0.875% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%.
Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings.
We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended April 30, 2018.
Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $1.9 billion at April 30, 2018.
These foreign funds were located primarily in Canada and India.
We intend to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and we currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations.
At April 30, 2018, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
We presented our contractual obligations at July 31, 2017 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended.
On September 13, 2017 we signed an agreement that includes a minimum purchase commitment of $450 million through August 31, 2022.
There were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
