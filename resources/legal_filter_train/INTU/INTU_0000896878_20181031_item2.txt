Please see the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” immediately preceding Part 1 for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.
We adopted the new accounting standards for revenue recognition effective August 1, 2018.
Beginning with the first quarter of our fiscal 2019, our financial results reflect the adoption of the standards with the prior periods restated accordingly.
See Note 1 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information.
This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The rapid expansion of cloud-based services is creating a more dynamic and highly competitive software industry.
High availability and speed of service are reshaping customer expectations around the world.
These shifts are accelerating product introductions and enhancements.
Among cloud-based service companies, free business models and micro-job solutions are also becoming more prevalent within the industry.
Our Consumer and Strategic Partner offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April.
This seasonal pattern results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.
To remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
As we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important.
Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data.
We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
We continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.
These non-financial drivers include, for example, customer growth and retention for all of our businesses.
Online service offerings are a significant part of our business.
Below, we have updated our revenue recognition critical accounting policy for the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and their disclosure in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the Audit and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors.
We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, software subscriptions, hosted services, payroll services, merchant payment processing services, financial supplies and hardware.
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
In determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process.
These judgments and estimates include (1) identifying performance obligations in the contract; (2) determining whether the performance obligations are distinct; (3) determining the standalone sales price (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation; (4) determining the timing of revenue recognition for distinct performance obligations; and (5) estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price.
For additional information, see “Revenue Recognition” in Note 1 to the financial statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.
Operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $10 million compared with an operating loss of $35 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
The decrease was due to the increase in revenue described above partially offset by higher costs and expenses for staffing and advertising and marketing programs.
See “Operating Expenses” later in this Item 2 for more information.
We recorded net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 of $34 million compared with a net loss of $2 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
During the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $41 million and $25 million, respectively, in our provision for income taxes.
The increase in excess tax benefits on share-based compensation was primarily due to an increase in stock option exercises during the period and resulted in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to a net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments.
See “Executive Overview – About Intuit” earlier in this Item 2 and Note 9 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information.
All of our segments operate and sell to customers primarily in the United States.
International total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.
Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses.
See “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 2 for a description of the seasonality of our business.
These unallocated costs totaled $402 million in the first three months of fiscal 2019 and $372 million in the first three months of fiscal 2018.
Segment expenses also do not include amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.
See Note 9 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for reconciliations of total segment operating income or loss to consolidated operating income or loss for each fiscal period presented.
Our Online Ecosystem includes revenue from QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Self-Employed financial and business management offerings; small business payroll services, including QuickBooks Online Payroll, Intuit Online Payroll, Intuit Full Service Payroll; merchant payment processing services for small businesses who use online offerings; and financing for small businesses.
Our Desktop Ecosystem includes revenue from our QuickBooks Desktop packaged software products (Desktop Pro, Desktop for Mac, Desktop Premier, and QuickBooks Point of Sale); QuickBooks Desktop software subscriptions (QuickBooks Desktop Pro Plus, QuickBooks Desktop Premier Plus, and QuickBooks Enterprise, and ProAdvisor Program memberships for the accounting professionals who serve small businesses); desktop payroll products (QuickBooks Basic Payroll, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll and QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll); merchant payment processing services for small businesses who use desktop offerings; and financial supplies.
Segment product revenue is derived from revenue related to software license and version protection for our QuickBooks Desktop products and subscriptions, license and related updates for our desktop payroll products and financial supplies, which are all part of our Desktop Ecosystem.
Segment service and other revenue is derived from our Online Ecosystem revenue; and Desktop Ecosystem revenue related to support and connected services for our QuickBooks Desktop and desktop payroll products and subscriptions and merchant payment processing services.
Online Ecosystem revenue increased 42% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period of fiscal 2018.

Desktop Ecosystem revenue decreased 4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to the delivery of version protection for our QuickBooks Enterprise customers, which was partially offset by an increase in license revenue related to customer acquisition for our QuickBooks Enterprise offering.
QuickBooks Desktop subscribers were up 8% as compared with the same point in time a year ago.
Consumer segment product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax desktop tax return preparation software and related form updates.
Consumer segment service and other revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax Online products, electronic tax filing services and connected services, and also from our Mint and Turbo offerings.
Due to the seasonal nature of our Consumer offerings, we typically generate nominal revenue from Consumer products and services in our first fiscal quarter compared with our second and third fiscal quarters.
The majority of revenue for the first quarter of each fiscal year is for the filing of extended returns for the previous tax year.
Because of the seasonality of our Consumer revenue, we do not believe that first quarter revenue in this segment is indicative of revenue trends for the current fiscal year.
We will not have substantially complete results for the 2018 tax season until the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
We do not believe that Consumer segment operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same quarter of fiscal 2018 are indicative of trends for the full fiscal year.
Strategic Partner segment product revenue is derived primarily from Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProFile desktop tax preparation software products and related form updates.

We do not believe that Strategic Partner segment operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same quarter of fiscal 2018 are indicative of trends for the full fiscal year.
Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue was consistent in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period of fiscal 2018.
Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue was consistent in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period of fiscal 2018.
Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period of fiscal 2018.
Total net revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $106 million or 12% while total operating expenses for the quarter increased $32 million or 4%.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 has been restated to reflect the full retrospective application of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” See Note 1 and Note 6 to the financial statements in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report for more information.
The effective date of the tax rate change was January 1, 2018.
The change resulted in a blended lower U.S. statutory federal rate of 26.9% for fiscal 2018.
The increase in excess tax benefits on share-based compensation was primarily due to an increase in stock option exercises during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
We recorded a $48 million tax benefit on a pretax loss of $14 million for the three months ended October 31, 2018.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was approximately 95%.
At October 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.3 billion, a decrease of $384 million from July 31, 2018 due to the factors discussed under “Statements of Cash Flows” below.
Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facility.
Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and debt repayment, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends.
As discussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 2, our business is subject to significant seasonality.
The balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern.
Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $1.3 billion at October 31, 2018.
None of those funds were restricted and approximately 82% of those funds were located in the U.S. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases.
Our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these types of opportunities.
Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months.
stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.
As described in Note 7 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, during the first three months of fiscal 2019 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized.
At October 31, 2018, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $3.1 billion for stock repurchases.
During the three months ended October 31, 2018 we declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of outstanding common stock for a total of $129 million.
In November 2018 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of outstanding common stock payable on January 18, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 10, 2019.
On February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion.
Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times.
Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%.
Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings.
We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility.
We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.
We may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate.
The term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.125% to 0.875% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%.
Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings.
We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended October 31, 2018.
Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $1.3 billion at October 31, 2018.
These foreign funds were located primarily in Canada and India.

We presented our contractual obligations at July 31, 2018 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended.
There were no significant changes to our contractual obligations during the first three months of fiscal 2019.
