This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The rapid expansion of cloud-based services is creating a more dynamic and highly competitive software industry.
High availability and speed of service are reshaping customer expectations around the world.
These shifts are accelerating product introductions and enhancements.
Among cloud-based service companies, free business models and micro-job solutions are also becoming more prevalent within the industry.
This seasonal pattern results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.
As we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important.
Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data.
We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
We continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.
These non-financial drivers include, for example, customer growth and retention for all of our businesses.
Online service offerings are a significant part of our business.
We ended the first nine months of fiscal 2019 with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $3.3 billion.
Below, we have updated our revenue recognition critical accounting policy for the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, software subscriptions, hosted services, payroll services, merchant payment processing services, financial supplies and hardware.
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
In determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process.
are distinct; (3) determining the standalone sales price (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation; (4) determining the timing of revenue recognition for distinct performance obligations; and (5) estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price.

At April 30, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion from July 31, 2018 due to the factors discussed under “Statements of Cash Flows” below.
Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facility.
Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and debt repayment, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends.
As discussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 2, our business is subject to significant seasonality.
The balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern.
Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $3.3 billion at April 30, 2019.
None of those funds were restricted and approximately 92% of those funds were located in the U.S. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases.
Our secured revolving credit facility is available to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses.
Our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these types of opportunities.
Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months.
We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.
As described in Note 7 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized.

In May 2019 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of outstanding common stock payable on July 18, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 10, 2019.
On February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion.
Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times.
Advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%.
Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings.
We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility.
We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.
We may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate.
The term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.125% to 0.875% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%.
Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings.
We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended April 30, 2019.
On May 2, 2019 we entered into an amendment to the master credit agreement.
The amendment extends the maturity date of the unsecured revolving credit facility to May 2, 2024 and modifies the interest rate on the unsecured revolving credit facility to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.1% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 0.69% to 1.1%.
Additionally, the amendment modifies the unsecured term loan to $400 million, decreases the interest rate on the term loan to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.125% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 0.625% to 1.125% and reduces the amount available to increase commitments under the term loan to $400 million in the aggregate.

These foreign funds were located primarily in Canada and India.
At April 30, 2019, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
We presented our contractual obligations at July 31, 2018 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended.
There were no significant changes to our contractual obligations during the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
