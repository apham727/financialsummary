We have market rate sensitivity for interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Our variable rate debt is our primary financial instrument with market risk exposure for changing interest rates.
We manage our variable rate interest rate risk through a combination of short-term and long-term borrowings and the use of derivative instruments entered into for hedging purposes.
There were no significant changes in how we manage interest rate risk between December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2018.
