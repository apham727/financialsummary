Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed only to provide reasonable assurance that they will meet their objectives.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) pursuant to Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b).
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide the reasonable assurance discussed above.
As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this report, we adopted ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019.
We implemented internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of the new standard on our financial statements.
