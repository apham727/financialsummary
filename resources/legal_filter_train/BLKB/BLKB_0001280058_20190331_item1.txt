The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim financial reporting.
The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations for interim reporting of the SEC.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Blackbaud, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Our chief operating decision maker uses consolidated financial information to make operating decisions, assess financial performance and allocate resources.
Our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer ("CEO").
ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheet but recognize expenses in the income statement in a manner similar to previous guidance.
The way in which entities classify leases determines how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense.
to use the hindsight practical expedient, which permits entities to use hindsight in determining the lease term and assessing impairment.
Additionally, we elected not to apply the recognition requirements of the new lease accounting standard to short-term leases.
Adopting ASU 2016-02 had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019, as we recognized $121.6 million of lease liabilities and $113.4 million of right-of-use ("ROU") assets for those leases classified as operating leases.
Except for the accounting policy added for leases below as a result of adopting ASU 2016-02, there have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019, that have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statement.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
The operating lease ROU asset also includes any initial direct costs and lease payments made and excludes lease incentives.
Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
Lease expense for lease payments related to our operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately.
We do not recognize short-term leases (those that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less) on our consolidated balance sheets.
On January 2, 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities, including all voting equity interests, of YourCause Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("YourCause"), pursuant to a purchase agreement and plan of merger.
The acquisition expands our footprint in corporate social responsibility and employee engagement and enhances our position as a leader in providing solutions to both nonprofit organizations and for-profit companies committed to addressing social issues.
We acquired the equity securities for an aggregate purchase price of $157.7 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the agreement and plan of merger.
The purchase price and related expenses were funded primarily through borrowings under the 2017 Credit Facility (as defined below).
As a result of the acquisition, YourCause has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we incurred insignificant acquisition-related expenses associated with the acquisition, which were recorded in general and administrative expense.
The estimates and assumptions are subject to change as we obtain additional information during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date.
The estimated fair value of accounts receivable acquired approximates the contractual value of $4.1 million and $54.7 million of the goodwill arising in the acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes.
The estimated goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to the opportunities for expected synergies from combining the operations and assembled workforce of YourCause.
The estimated fair values of the intangible assets were based on variations of the income approach, which estimates fair value based upon the present value of cash flows that the assets are expected to generate, and which included the relief-from-royalty method, incremental cash flow method, including the comparative (with and without) method and multi-period excess earnings method, depending on the intangible asset being valued.
The method of amortization of identifiable finite-lived intangible assets is based on the expected pattern in which the estimated economic benefits of the respective assets are consumed or otherwise used up.
Customer relationships and acquired technology assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis.
Marketing assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis.
The non-compete agreements were fully amortized as of March 31, 2019, based on the insignificance of the acquired assets.
We compute basic earnings (loss) per share by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflect the assumed exercise, settlement and vesting of all dilutive securities using the “treasury stock method” except when the effect is anti-dilutive.
Potentially dilutive securities consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, settlement of stock appreciation rights and vesting of restricted stock awards and units.
Diluted loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is the same as basic loss per share as there is a net loss in the period and inclusion of potentially dilutive securities is anti-dilutive.
•Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
Our derivative instruments within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are required to be recorded at fair value.
Our derivative instruments that are recorded at fair value include interest rate swaps.
The fair value of our interest rate swaps was based on model-driven valuations using LIBOR rates, which are observable at commonly quoted intervals.
Accordingly, our interest rate swaps are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
We believe the carrying amount of our debt approximates its fair value at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, as the debt bears interest rates that approximate market value.
As LIBOR rates are observable at commonly quoted intervals, our debt is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
We did not transfer any assets or liabilities among the levels within the fair value hierarchy during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
These non-recurring fair value measurements, primarily for intangible assets acquired and operating lease ROU assets, are based on Level 3 unobservable inputs.
In the event of an impairment, we determine the fair value of the intangible assets other than goodwill using a discounted cash flow approach, which contains significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement.
The unobservable inputs in the analysis generally include future cash flow projections and a discount rate.
For goodwill impairment testing, we estimate fair value using market-based methods including the use of market capitalization and consideration of a control premium.
See Note 15 to these consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our facilities optimization restructuring.
There were no non-recurring fair value adjustments to intangible assets and goodwill during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The following table summarizes our debt balances and the related weighted average effective interest rates, which includes the effect of interest rate swap agreements.
On January 2, 2019, we acquired YourCause for $157.7 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the agreement and plan of merger.
We financed the acquisition with a revolving credit loan under the 2017 Credit Facility.
We generally use derivative instruments to manage our variable interest rate risk.
In July 2017, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "July 2017 Swap Agreement"), which effectively converts portions of our variable rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed rate for the term of the July 2017 Swap Agreement.
The notional value of the July 2017 Swap Agreement was $150.0 million with an effective date beginning in July 2017 through July 2021.
We designated the July 2017 Swap Agreement as a cash flow hedge at the inception of the contract.
In February 2018, we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement (the "February 2018 Swap Agreement"), which effectively converts portions of our variable rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed rate for the term of the February 2018 Swap Agreement.
The notional value of the February 2018 Swap Agreement was $50.0 million with an effective date beginning in February 2018 through June 2021.
We designated the February 2018 Swap Agreement as a cash flow hedge at the inception of the contract.
Our policy requires that derivatives used for hedging purposes be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract.
The estimated accumulated other comprehensive income as of March 31, 2019 that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is $0.7 million.
We have operating leases for corporate offices, subleased offices and certain equipment and furniture.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years.
We do not have lease agreements with residual value guarantees, sale leaseback terms or material restrictive covenants.
In May 2016, we entered into a lease agreement for our New Headquarters Facility in Charleston, South Carolina.
There are two phases for construction of the New Headquarters Facility.
Phase One included a building with approximately 172,000 rentable square feet, which we began using in April 2018.
The lease agreement also grants us a Phase Two option to request that the landlord construct and lease to us a second office building and related improvements.
The lease agreement expires in April 2038 and provides for four renewal periods of five years each at a base rent equal to the then prevailing market rate for comparable buildings.
We continue to lease our former headquarters facility, now called our Customer Operations Center, in Charleston, South Carolina.
The lease expires in October 2023 and has two five-year renewal options.
We also have a lease for office space in Austin, Texas which expires in September 2023 and has two five-year renewal options.
For each of the leases discussed above, we have not included the renewal options in the lease terms for calculating the lease liability as the renewal options allow us to maintain operational flexibility and we are not reasonably certain we will exercise these options at this time.
As of March 31, 2019, we had additional operating leases, primarily for office space, that have not yet commenced with future rent payments of $9.3 million.
These operating leases will commence during fiscal year 2019 with lease terms of two to four years.
See Note 15 to these consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our facilities optimization restructuring.
The balance of the term loans and any amounts drawn on the revolving credit loans are due upon maturity of the 2017 Credit Facility in June 2022.
In certain cases, these arrangements require a minimum annual purchase commitment by us.
As of March 31, 2019, the remaining aggregate minimum purchase commitment under these arrangements was approximately $111.4 million through 2023.
We have not identified any losses and, accordingly, we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnifications.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred.
Litigation is inherently unpredictable.
The increase in our effective income tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was partially attributable to the impact of discrete tax benefits on a pre-tax loss for the quarter as compared to pre-tax income for the same period in 2018.
The increase in our effective income tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, was also due to a decrease in the discrete benefit to income tax expense relating to stock-based compensation.
Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy, which provides for the distribution to stockholders of a portion of cash generated by us that is in excess of operational needs and capital expenditures.
The 2017 Credit Facility limits the amount of dividends payable and certain state laws restrict the amount of dividends distributed.
In February 2019, our Board of Directors approved an annual dividend rate of $0.48 per share to be made in quarterly payments.
The following table provides information with respect to quarterly dividends of $0.12 per share paid on common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
On April 30, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.12 per share payable on June 14, 2019 to stockholders of record on May 28, 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, approximately $739 million of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations.
The amount of revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2019 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was approximately $131 million.
The amount of revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2019 from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was insignificant.
•The GMG focuses on sales primarily to all K-12 private schools, faith-based and arts and cultural organizations, as well as emerging and mid-sized prospects in the U.S.;
•The IMG focuses on sales primarily to all prospects and customers outside of the U.S.
During 2017, in an effort to further our organizational objectives, including improved operating efficiency, customer outcomes and employee satisfaction, we initiated a multi-year plan to consolidate and relocate some of our existing offices to highly modern and more collaborative workspaces with short-term financial commitments.
These workspaces are also more centrally located for our employees and closer to our customers and prospects.
Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 at January 1, 2019, we reduced our operating lease ROU assets recognized at transition by the carrying amounts of the restructuring liabilities for certain leased office spaces that we ceased using prior to December 31, 2018.
