We have market rate sensitivity for interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
We manage our variable rate interest rate risk through a combination of short-term and long-term borrowings and the use of derivative instruments entered into for hedging purposes.
There were no significant changes in how we manage interest rate risk between December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018.
