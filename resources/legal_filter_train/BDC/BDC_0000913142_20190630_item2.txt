Belden Inc. (the Company, us, we, or our) is a signal transmission solutions company built around two global business platforms – Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions. Our comprehensive portfolio of signal transmission solutions provides industry leading secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
We use a set of tools and processes that are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality, delivery, cost, and innovation. We consider revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flows, and return on invested capital to be our key operating performance indicators. We also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve these objectives. 
Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, Indian rupee, and Brazilian real. Generally, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are negatively impacted as our foreign denominated revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower rate. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are positively impacted. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S.
We completed the acquisitions of Opterna International Corp. (Opterna) on April 15, 2019 and FutureLink on April 5, 2019. The results of Opterna and FutureLink have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition dates and are reported in the Enterprise Solutions segment. See Note 3.
In 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate SAM with Grass Valley. The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions. We recognized $3.0 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the six months ended June 30, 2019. The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment. We do not expect to incur any more costs for this program. 
In 2019, we began a restructuring program to integrate Opterna and FutureLink with our existing businesses. The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions. We recognized $2.5 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment. We expect to incur approximately $3 million of additional severance and restructuring costs for this program, most of which will be incurred by the end of 2019.

Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased due to the decreases in revenue discussed above and was further impacted from unfavorable mix which was partially offset by decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $6.8 million from the comparable period of 2018. Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased due to the decreases in revenue discussed above and was further impacted from unfavorable mix which was partially offset by decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $15.7 million from the comparable period of 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $16.4 million and $18.4 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily due to a decrease in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $12.2 million and $18.8 million, respectively.
Research and development expenses decreased $2.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily due to a decrease in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $2.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively.
Amortization of intangibles decreased $2.7 million and $3.7 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.
Operating income increased $4.6 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 as the decreases in operating expenses were greater than the decreases in gross profit discussed above.
Net interest expense decreased $0.9 million and $3.7 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 as a result of our debt transactions during 2018. In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%, and used the net proceeds of this offering and cash on hand to repurchase all of our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023 as well as all of our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024. 
Income before taxes increased $9.3 million and $33.1 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018. This increase is primarily a result of the loss on debt extinguishment in the prior year as well as the decline in net interest expense and increase in operating income over the year ago periods discussed above.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, we recognized income tax expense of $5.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of 10.9% and 13.8%, respectively. The effective tax rates were impacted by an income tax benefit of $6.4 million as a result of changes in our estimated valuation allowance requirement related to foreign tax credits due to the restructuring of certain foreign operations. These effective rates are also reflective of the impact of more favorable statutory tax rates applied to the earnings of these foreign operations due to the restructuring efforts.
The decrease in volume was primarily experienced in our Enterprise solutions segment, partially offset by an increase in volume in our Industrial solutions segment. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $21.4 million and $37.6 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased due to the decreases in Adjusted Revenues discussed above and was further impacted by unfavorable mix as compared to the comparable period of 2018.
