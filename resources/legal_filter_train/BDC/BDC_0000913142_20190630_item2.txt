Belden Inc. (the Company, us, we, or our) is a signal transmission solutions company built around two global business platforms – Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions.
We use a set of tools and processes that are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality, delivery, cost, and innovation.
We consider revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flows, and return on invested capital to be our key operating performance indicators.
We also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve these objectives.
Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, Indian rupee, and Brazilian real.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S.
As the U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, it results in a relative price increase or decrease for certain of our products that are priced in U.S. dollars in a foreign location.
Generally, as the costs of inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices, we raise selling prices to customers to cover the increase in costs, resulting in higher sales revenue but a lower gross profit percentage.
Therefore, all references to the effect of copper prices or other commodity prices are estimates.
Our channel partners and customers purchase and hold the products they bought from us in their inventory in order to meet the service and on-time delivery requirements of their customers.
Comparisons of our results between periods can be impacted by changes in the levels of channel inventory.
We use information provided to us by our channel partners and make certain assumptions based on our sales to them to determine the amount of products they bought from us and hold in their inventory.
As such, all references to the effect of channel inventory changes are estimates.
The markets in which we operate can generally be characterized as highly competitive and highly fragmented, with many players.
We expect that our unit sales volume will increase or decrease consistently with the market growth rate.
Our strategic goal is to utilize our Market Delivery System to target faster growing geographies, applications, and trends within our end markets, in order to achieve growth that is higher than the general market growth rate.
To the extent that we exceed the market growth rates, we consider it to be the result of capturing market share.
We completed the acquisitions of Opterna International Corp. (Opterna) on April 15, 2019 and FutureLink on April 5, 2019.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $3.0 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
We do not expect to incur any more costs for this program.
In 2019, we began a restructuring program to integrate Opterna and FutureLink with our existing businesses.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions.

The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.

Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased due to the decreases in revenue discussed above and was further impacted from unfavorable mix which was partially offset by decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $6.8 million from the comparable period of 2018.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $16.4 million and $18.4 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily due to a decrease in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $12.2 million and $18.8 million, respectively.
Research and development expenses decreased $2.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily due to a decrease in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $2.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively.

Operating income increased $4.6 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 as the decreases in operating expenses were greater than the decreases in gross profit discussed above.

This increase is primarily a result of the loss on debt extinguishment in the prior year as well as the decline in net interest expense and increase in operating income over the year ago periods discussed above.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, we recognized income tax expense of $5.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of 10.9% and 13.8%, respectively.
These effective rates are also reflective of the impact of more favorable statutory tax rates applied to the earnings of these foreign operations due to the restructuring efforts.

We believe this presentation is useful in evaluating the underlying performance of acquired companies.
