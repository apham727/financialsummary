Belden Inc. (the Company, us, we, or our) is a signal transmission solutions company built around two global business platforms – Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions. Our comprehensive portfolio of signal transmission solutions provides industry leading secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
We use a set of tools and processes that are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality, delivery, cost, and innovation. We consider revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flows, and return on invested capital to be our key operating performance indicators. We also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve these objectives. 
Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, and Brazilian real. Generally, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are negatively impacted as our foreign denominated revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower rate. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are positively impacted. For both the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, approximately 49% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S. 
Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure and, as a result, now are reporting two segments. The segments formerly known as Broadcast Solutions and Enterprise Solutions now are presented as the Enterprise Solutions segment, and the segments formerly known as Industrial Solutions and Network Solutions now are presented as the Industrial Solutions segment. The reorganization allows us to further accelerate progress in key strategic areas and the segment consolidation properly aligns our external reporting with the way the businesses are now managed. We have recast the prior period segment information to conform to the change in the composition of these reportable segments.
We completed the acquisition of Net-Tech Technology, Inc. (NT2) and Snell Advanced Media (SAM) on April 25, 2018 and February 8, 2018, respectively. The results of both NT2 and SAM have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date and are reported in the Enterprise Solutions segment. See Note 3.
In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million ($431.3 million at issuance) aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%. During March and April 2018, we used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024 and our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023. We paid approximately $7.5 million of fees related to issuing the 2028 notes, and recognized a $3.0 million and $23.0 million loss on debt extinguishment during the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively, for premiums paid to the bond holders to retire the 2024 and 2023 notes and for the unamortized debt issuance costs that we wrote-off. See Note 10.
During the first quarter of 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate SAM with Grass Valley. The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions. We recognized $20.3 million and $29.5 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively. The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment. We expect to incur approximately $22 million of additional severance and restructuring costs for this program, most of which will be incurred by the end of 2018. We also expect the program to generate approximately $44 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we will start realizing in the second half of 2018.
In 2016, we began a program to consolidate our manufacturing footprint. The manufacturing consolidation will be completed this year. We recognized $3.9 million and $11.4 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively. The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, as the manufacturing locations involved in the program serve both platforms. We expect the program to generate approximately $13 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we began to realize in the third quarter of 2017. 
•Acquisitions contributed $37.2 million and $65.8 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
•Higher sales volume resulted in a $8.3 million and $14.5 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
•The divestiture of our MCS business resulted in a $7.0 million and $13.0 million decrease in revenues in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively. 
Gross profit increased in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017 due to the increases in revenues discussed above. In the three months ended July 1, 2018, decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; purchase accounting effects of acquisitions; and accelerated depreciation of $1.0 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, further contributed to the increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in the amortization of software development intangible assets as compared to the year ago period. For the six months ended July 1, 2018, decreases in accelerated depreciation of $0.5 million further contributed to the increase in gross profit, partially offset by increases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; amortization of software development intangible assets; and purchase accounting effects of acquisitions of $2.6 million, $0.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively, as compared to the year ago period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $20.8 million and $33.1 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017. Acquisitions contributed $13.0 million and $23.3 million, respectively, to the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses year-over-year. Increases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs, contributed $13.1 million and $21.8 million, respectively, to the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses year-over-year. Currency translation contributed approximately $2.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively, to the increase 
in selling, general and administrative expenses year-over-year. These increases were partially offset by $6.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively, from improved productivity, and $1.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, from the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses increased $2.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017. Acquisitions contributed $4.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively; increases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs contributed $3.2 million and $4.8 million, respectively; and currency translation contributed $0.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, to the increase in research and development expenses. These increases were partially offset by $5.7 million and $9.6 million, respectively, from improved productivity and $0.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively, from the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Amortization of intangibles decreased $2.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017. The decrease is due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized, partially offset by the acquisitions of SAM, Thinklogical, and NT2, which contributed a total $3.0 million and $8.4 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 as compared to the year ago period. 
Operating income decreased $6.3 million and $13.7 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017 primarily due to the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development, partially offset by the increase in gross profit and decrease in amortization expense discussed above. 
Net interest expense decreased $8.4 million, or 35.9%, and $15.0 million, or 31.8%, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively, from the comparable period of 2017 as a result of our debt transactions during 2017 and 2018. In July 2017, we issued €450.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2027 at an interest rate of 3.375%, and used the net proceeds of this offering and cash on hand to repurchase all of our outstanding $700.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2022. In September 2017, we issued €300.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2025 at an interest rate of 2.875%, and used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase €300.0 million of our outstanding €500.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023. In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%, and used the net proceeds of this offering and cash on hand to repurchase all of our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023 and all of our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024. See Note 10.
The loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2018 represents the premium paid to the bond holders to retire the 2023 and 2024 notes and the unamortized debt issuance costs that were written-off. The loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2017 represents unamortized debt issuance costs related to creditors no longer participating in the Amended and Restated Agreement (the Revolver). See Note 10. 
Income before taxes remained flat for in three months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017, but decreased $20.8 million in the six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017 primarily due to the loss on debt extinguishment and decrease in operating income, partially offset by lower interest expense discussed above.
•We recognized an income tax benefit of $1.2 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 due to a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions of prior years.
•Acquisitions contributed $40.0 million and $70.5 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
•Higher sales volume contributed $8.3 million and $14.5 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.

For additional information regarding our segment measures, see Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Enterprise Solutions revenues increased in both the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017. For the three months ended July 1, 2018, acquisitions, higher copper prices, favorable currency translation, and volume growth contributed $40.0 million, $5.1 million, $4.1 million, and $1.7 million, respectively, to the increase in revenues. For the six months ended July 1, 2018, acquisitions, favorable currency translation, and higher copper prices contributed $70.5 million, $12.1 million, and $8.6 million, respectively, to the increase in revenues, partially offset by declines in volume of $3.6 million. 
Enterprise Solutions EBITDA increased $13.9 million and $21.7 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017 as a result of the revenue growth discussed above, successful restructuring actions, 
and sustainable productivity initiatives. Accordingly, EBITDA margins expanded 140 and 100 basis points, respectively, over the year ago period.
Industrial Solutions revenues increased in both the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017. For the three months ended July 1, 2018, volume growth, favorable currency translation, and higher copper prices contributed $6.6 million, $5.7 million, and $4.6 million, respectively, to the increase in revenues, partially offset by $7.0 million from the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the six months ended July 1, 2018, volume growth, favorable currency translation, and higher copper prices contributed $18.1 million, $15.6 million, and $8.6 million, respectively, to the increase in revenues, partially offset by $13.0 million from the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Industrial Solutions EBITDA decreased $0.8 million and increased $1.8 million in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017, respectively. The revenue growth discussed above was partially offset by unfavorable product mix experienced during the three and six months ended July 1, 2018.
Net cash used for operating activities for the six months ended July 1, 2018 totaled $29.4 million, compared to $34.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the comparable period of 2017. The decrease in operating cash flow as compared to prior year is primarily due to an unfavorable change in accounts payable. Accounts payable was a use of cash of $84.7 million in 
the first six months of 2018 compared to a source of cash of $14.7 million in the prior year period. The accounts payable use of cash in the first six months of 2018 is primarily attributable to higher inventory levels, due in part to the build in safety stock inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017 in support of the closure of an operating facility. This is evidenced through the decline in inventory turns from 5.8 turns in the second quarter of 2017 to 5.2 turns in second quarter of 2018, while days payable outstanding remained constant at 87 days. 
Net cash used for investing activities totaled $82.4 million for the six months ended July 1, 2018, compared to $189.1 million for the comparable period of 2017. Investing activities for the six months ended July 1, 2018 included payments, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of SAM and NT2 of $83.7 million, capital expenditures of $39.5 million, net proceeds from the sale of an operating facility of $1.5 million, and a payment related to our 2015 acquisition of Tripwire that had previously been deferred of $1.0 million; net of cash received for the sale of the MCS business and Hirschmann JV which closed on December 31, 2017 of $40.2 million. Investing activities for the six months ended July 2, 2017 included payments, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Thinklogical of $165.8 million, capital expenditures of $22.2 million, and a $1.0 million payment related to our 2015 acquisition of Tripwire that had previously been deferred.
Our outstanding debt obligations as of July 1, 2018 consisted of $1,507.0 million of senior subordinated notes. Additional discussion regarding our various borrowing arrangements is included in Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As of July 1, 2018, we had $348.0 million in available borrowing capacity under our Revolver.
We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
