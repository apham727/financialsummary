Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, for the three and six month period ended July 1, 2018.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, because of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described in our 2017 Form 10-K as filed on February 13, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of July 1, 2018.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
We are executing our remediation plan as described fully in our 2017 Form 10-K.
In response to the identified material weakness, our management, with oversight from our audit committee, has dedicated resources to improve our control environment and to remedy the identified material weakness.
These controls include additional procedures related to the review and approval of terms and conditions of revenue contracts.
However, the Company is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new processes for a sufficient period of time.
We are committed to achieving and maintaining a strong control environment, high ethical standards, and financial reporting integrity and transparency.
As described above, we have designed and implemented additional controls in connection with our remediation plan.
