The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include Belden Inc. and all of its subsidiaries (the Company, us, we, or our).
We eliminate all significant affiliate accounts and transactions in consolidation.
These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are a signal transmission solutions provider built around two global business platforms – Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions.
Our comprehensive portfolio of signal transmission solutions provides industry leading secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
Our fiscal year and fiscal fourth quarter both end on December 31.
Our fiscal first quarter ends on the Sunday falling closest to 91 days after December 31, which was April 1, 2018, the 91st day of our fiscal year 2018.
The three months ended April 2, 2017 included 92 days.
Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure and, as a result, now are reporting two segments.
The segments formerly known as Broadcast Solutions and Enterprise Solutions now are presented as the Enterprise Solutions segment, and the segments formerly known as Industrial Solutions and Network Solutions now are presented as the Industrial Solutions segment.
The reorganization allows us to further accelerate progress in key strategic areas and the segment consolidation properly aligns our external reporting with the way the businesses are now managed.
We have made certain reclassifications to the 2017 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements including for the adoption of ASU 2017-07 and for our segment change with no impact to reported net income in order to conform to the 2018 presentation.
During the financial closing process for the fourth quarter of 2017, we determined that certain consolidated financial statement amounts were not recorded correctly in prior interim periods of 2017.
The errors primarily related to recognizing revenue prior to satisfying all of the delivery criteria in one business within our Enterprise segment.
The impact of the errors in the first quarter of 2017 was an overstatement of revenues and net income of $6.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively.
•Level 3 – Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
As of and during the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, we utilized Level 1 inputs to determine the fair value of cash equivalents, and we utilized Level 2 and Level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations (see Note 3).
We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017.
We classify cash on hand and deposits in banks, including commercial paper, money market accounts, and other investments with an original maturity of three months or less, that we hold from time to time, as cash and cash equivalents.
We periodically have cash equivalents consisting of short-term money market funds and other investments.
As of April 1, 2018, we did not have any such cash equivalents on hand.
The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations.
We accrue environmental remediation costs based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures developed in consultation with our environmental consultants and legal counsel.
As of April 1, 2018, we were party to standby letters of credit, bank guaranties, and surety bonds totaling $7.3 million, $2.7 million, and $2.4 million, respectively.
On July 5, 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, PPC Broadband, Inc. (PPC), filed an action for patent infringement against Corning Optical Communications RF LLC (Corning).
In July 2015, a jury found that Corning willfully infringed both patents.
In November 2016, following a series of post-trial motions, the trial judge issued rulings for a total judgment in our favor of approximately $61.3 million.
In December 2016, Corning appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
In March 2018, a panel of three judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a Rule 36 Affirmance, without written opinion, of the District Court's final judgment that Corning, among other things, willfully infringed the PPC universal compression patents at issue in the case, and that PPC should be awarded about $61.8 million as a result.
On April 12, 2018, Corning filed a petition for re-hearing.
Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations.
For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.
Generally, the standalone selling prices are determined based upon the prices charged to customers.
We record revisions to these estimates in the period in which the facts that give rise to each revision become known.
The term between invoicing and when payment is due is generally not significant.
For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
Sales commissions for which the related service or support contract extends beyond one year are capitalized in other current or long-lived assets and recognized as expense over the related service or support period.
In the event the related service or support period is twelve months or less, we apply the practical expedient and expense the sales commissions when incurred.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
We adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method of adoption.
Adoption resulted in a $2.6 million, net of tax increase to retained earnings.
This adjustment primarily relates to the deferral of costs to obtain a contract that were previously expensed at the beginning of the contract period.
2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
Consequently, the standard eliminates the exception to the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer other than for inventory until the asset has been sold to an outside party.
We adopted ASU 2016-16 on January 1, 2018.
Adoption resulted in a $3.0 million and $46.9 million decrease to other current assets and other long-lived assets, respectively, as well as an $18.2 million increase in deferred income tax assets and a $31.7 million decrease to retained earnings on January 1, 2018.
Operations separately from the service cost component after Operating Income.
Additionally, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable.
The standard requires the amendments to be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other cost components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic OPEB cost in the Statement of Operations and prospectively, on and after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic pension and OPEB costs.
We adopted ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018, and elected to use the practical expedient related to the retrospective presentation requirements.
Adoption resulted in a $0.3 million increase to operating income, but no change to net income during the quarter ended April 2, 2017.
Under its core principle, a lessee will recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all arrangements with terms longer than 12 months.
Lessor accounting remains largely consistent with existing U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The new standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.
The guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred taxes related to GILTI inclusions or to treat any taxes on GILTI inclusions as a period cost are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election.
Pending further anticipated clarification and guidance related to the application of the GILTI provisions and their impact to Belden, we intend to further assess the materiality of the anticipated GILTI inclusion before making a policy election.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No.
Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
We recorded a net increase to retained earnings of $2.6 million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, with the impact primarily related to sales commissions and software revenues within our Industrial Solutions segment.
The impact to revenues for the three months ended April 1, 2018 was a decrease of $0.1 million as a result of applying Topic 606.
The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by major product category.
The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by geography, based on the location of the customer purchasing the product.
The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by products, including software products, and support and services.
We generate revenues primarily by selling products that provide secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
We also generate revenues from providing support and professional services.
We sell our products to distributors, end-users, installers, and directly to original equipment manufacturers.
At times, we enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple performance obligations.
For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative selling price and recognized when or as each performance obligation is satisfied.
Accrued rebates and accrued returns as of April 1, 2018 totaled $17.9 million and $6.9 million, respectively.
Estimated price adjustments recognized against our gross accounts receivable balance as of April 1, 2018 totaled $25.7 million.
Depending on the terms of an arrangement, we may defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received because we have to satisfy a future obligation.
Consideration allocated to support services under a support and maintenance contract is typically paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the service.
As of January 1, 2018, total deferred revenue was $104.4 million, and $52.0 million of this amount was recognized as revenue during the three months ended April 1, 2018.
Total deferred revenue was $97.8 million as of April 1, 2018.
Total capitalized sales commissions was $2.4 million as of April 1, 2018.
Total sales commissions costs were $6.1 million during the three months ended April 1, 2018.
Sales commissions are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.
The above purchase price allocation is preliminary, and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of individual assets and liabilities becomes available.
We are in the process of ensuring our accounting policies are applied at SAM.
A change in the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill.
For purposes of the above allocation, we based our estimate of the preliminary fair value for the acquired inventory; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and deferred revenue on a preliminary valuation study performed by a third party valuation firm.
To determine the value of the acquired property, plant, and equipment, we used various valuation methods, including both the market approach, which considers sales prices of similar assets in similar conditions (Level 2 valuation), and the cost approach, which considers the cost to replace the asset adjusted for depreciation (Level 3 valuation).
We used various valuation methods including discounted cash flows, lost income, excess earnings, and relief from royalty to estimate the preliminary fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and deferred revenue (Level 3 valuation).
The amortizable intangible assets reflected in the table above were determined by us to have finite lives.
The useful life for the customer relationship intangible asset was based on our forecasts of estimated sales from recurring customers.
The useful life of the backlog intangible asset was based on our estimate of when the ordered items would ship.
The useful life for the trademarks was based on the period of time we expect to continue to go to market using the trademarks.
The loss before taxes from SAM included $2.2 million of amortization of intangible assets and $0.5 million of cost of sales related to the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value.
The following table illustrates the unaudited pro forma effect on operating results as if the SAM acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2017.
For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the three months ended April 2, 2017 includes nonrecurring expenses related to the acquisition, including severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; amortization of the sales backlog intangible asset; and cost of sales arising from the adjustment of inventory to fair value of $9.2 million, $1.3 million, and $0.8 million, respectively.
Pro forma adjustments exclude cost savings from any synergies resulting from the acquisition.
For purposes of the above allocation, we based our estimate of the preliminary fair value for the acquired inventory, intangible assets, and deferred revenue on a preliminary valuation study performed by a third party valuation firm.
excess earnings, and relief from royalty to estimate the preliminary fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and deferred revenue (Level 3 valuation).
The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the allocation of the purchase price is substantially complete pending the completion of a stub period tax return that has yet to be filed.
The amortizable intangible assets reflected in the table above were determined by us to have finite lives.
The useful life for the customer relationship intangible asset was based on our forecasts of estimated sales from recurring customers.
The useful life for the trademarks was based on the period of time we expect to continue to go to market using the trademarks.
The useful life of the backlog intangible asset was based on our estimate of when the ordered items would ship.
The loss before taxes from Thinklogical included $3.2 million of amortization of intangible assets.
The following table illustrates the unaudited pro forma effect on operating results as if the Thinklogical acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2016.
Pro forma adjustments exclude cost savings from any synergies resulting from the acquisition.
During the fourth quarter of 2016, we committed to a plan to sell our MCS business and Hirschmann JV.
The MCS business operated in Germany and the United States and was part of the Industrial Solutions segment, and the Hirschmann JV was an equity method investment located in China.
Effective December 31, 2017, we sold the MCS business and Hirschmann JV for a total purchase price of $40.2 million, of which $39.1 million was collected during the first quarter of 2018.
Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure and, as a result, now are reporting two segments.
The segments formerly known as Broadcast Solutions and Enterprise Solutions now are presented as the Enterprise Solutions segment, and the segments formerly known as Industrial Solutions and Network Solutions now are presented as the Industrial Solutions segment.
The reorganization allows us to further accelerate progress in key strategic areas and the segment consolidation properly aligns our external reporting with the way the businesses are now managed.
This change had no impact to our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
Segment EBITDA excludes certain items, including depreciation expense; amortization of intangibles; asset impairment; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions, such as the adjustment of acquired inventory and deferred revenue to fair value; and other costs.
We allocate corporate expenses to the segments for purposes of measuring Segment EBITDA.
Corporate expenses are allocated on the basis of each segment’s relative EBITDA prior to the allocation.
Our measure of segment assets does not include cash, goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets, or corporate assets.
All goodwill is allocated to reporting units of our segments for purposes of impairment testing.
For the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 0.5 million and 0.3 million, respectively, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive.
In addition, for the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 0.2 million and 0.2 million, respectively, because the related performance conditions have not been satisfied.
Furthermore, for both the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include the impact of preferred shares that are convertible into 6.9 million common shares, because deducting the preferred stock dividends from net income was more dilutive.
For purposes of calculating basic earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are not included in the calculation of basic weighted average shares outstanding until all necessary conditions have been satisfied and issuance of the shares underlying the restricted stock units is no longer contingent.
For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are included to the extent that they are dilutive.
In determining whether unvested restricted stock units are dilutive, each issuance of restricted stock units is considered separately.
Once a restricted stock unit has vested, it is included in the calculation of both basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
We recognized depreciation expense of $11.9 million and $11.4 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, respectively.
We recognized amortization expense related to our intangible assets of $24.6 million and $23.7 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, respectively.
During the first quarter of 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate our acquisition of SAM with Grass Valley.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired operating facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $9.2 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three months ended April 1, 2018.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
We expect to incur approximately $41 million of additional severance and restructuring costs for this program, most of which will be incurred by the end of 2018.
We also expect the program to generate approximately $44 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we will start realizing in the second half of 2018.
The manufacturing consolidation is expected to be completed in 2018.
We recognized $7.5 million and $5.7 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, respectively.
To date, we have incurred a total of $55.9 million in severance and other restructuring costs, including manufacturing inefficiencies for this program.
We expect the program to generate approximately $13 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we began to realize in the third quarter of 2017.
Of the total severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs recognized in the three months ended April 2, 2017, $5.9 million, $0.7 million, and $0.0 million were included in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses; and research and development, respectively.
The majority of the other restructuring and integration costs related to these actions were paid as incurred or are payable within the next 60 days.
There were no significant severance accrual balances as of April 1, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
Our Revolving Credit Agreement provides a $400.0 million multi-currency asset-based revolving credit facility (The Revolver).
The maturity date of the Revolver is May 16, 2022.
Interest on outstanding borrowings is variable, based upon LIBOR or other similar indices in foreign jurisdictions, plus a spread that ranges from 1.25%-1.75%, depending upon our leverage position.

On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, we obtained additional information affecting the provisional amount initially recorded for the valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credits in 2017.
We continue to evaluate the need for a provisional amount regarding the non-deductibility of certain covered employee compensation associated with the amendments to IRC section 162(m).
As of the date of this filing, we reasonably believe no such provision should be recorded.
Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.
converted, each share of Preferred Stock will automatically convert into common stock on or around July 15, 2019 into between 120.46 and 132.50 shares of Belden common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.
This represents a range of 6.2 million to 6.9 million shares of Belden common stock to be issued upon conversion.
The number of shares of Belden common stock issuable upon the mandatory conversion of the Preferred Stock will be determined based upon the volume-weighted average price of Belden’s common stock over the 20 day trading period beginning on, and including, the 22nd scheduled trading day prior to July 15, 2019.
The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $501 million.
With respect to dividend and liquidation rights, the Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock and junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness.
During each of the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, the Preferred Stock accrued $8.7 million of dividends.

PPC Broadband, Inc. v. Corning Optical Communications RF, LLC - On July 5, 2011, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, PPC Broadband, Inc. (“PPC”), filed an action for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York against Corning Optical Communications RF LLC (“Corning”).
6,558,194 and 6,848,940 - each entitled “Connector and Method of Operation.” In July 2015, a jury found that Corning willfully infringed both patents.
In November 2016, following a series of post-trial motions, the trial judge issued rulings for a total judgment in our favor of approximately $61.3 million.
In December 2016, Corning appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
In March 2018, a panel of three judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a Rule 36 Affirmance, without written opinion, of the District Court's final judgment that Corning, among other things, willfully infringed the PPC universal compression patents at issue in the case, and that PPC should be awarded about $61.8 million as a result.
On April 12, 2018, Corning filed a petition for re-hearing.
We are also a party to various legal proceedings and administrative actions that are incidental to our operations.
