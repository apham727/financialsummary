We generate revenues primarily by selling products that provide secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
We also generate revenues from providing support and professional services.
We sell our products to distributors, end-users, installers, and directly to original equipment manufacturers.
At times, we enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple performance obligations.
For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative selling price and recognized when or as each performance obligation is satisfied.
Generally, we determine relative selling price using the prices charged to customers on a standalone basis.
Adjustments to revenue for performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was not significant during the three months ended March 31, 2019.

During the first quarter 2019, we did not record any significant measurement-period adjustments.
For purposes of the above allocation, we based our estimate of the fair values for the acquired inventory; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and deferred revenue on valuation studies performed by a third party valuation firm.
To determine the value of the acquired property, plant, and equipment, we used various valuation methods, including both the market approach, which considers sales prices of similar assets in similar conditions (Level 2 valuation), and the cost approach, which considers the cost to replace the asset adjusted for depreciation (Level 3 valuation).
We used various valuation methods including discounted cash flows, lost income, excess earnings, and relief from royalty to estimate the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and deferred revenue (Level 3 valuation).
The amortizable intangible assets reflected in the table above were determined by us to have finite lives.
The useful life for the customer relationship intangible asset was based on our forecasts of estimated sales from recurring customers.
The useful life of the backlog intangible asset was based on our estimate of when the ordered items would ship.
The useful life for the trademarks was based on the period of time we expect to continue to go to market using the trademarks.
Our consolidated revenues and consolidated income before taxes for the three months ended April 1, 2018 included $20.8 million and $(2.8) million, respectively, from SAM.

The following table illustrates the unaudited pro forma effect on operating results as if the SAM acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2017.
Pro forma adjustments exclude cost savings from any synergies resulting from the acquisition.
The key measures of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker are Segment Revenues and Segment EBITDA.
Segment EBITDA excludes certain items, including depreciation expense; amortization of intangibles; asset impairment; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions, such as the adjustment of acquired inventory and deferred revenue to fair value; and other costs.
We allocate corporate expenses to the segments for purposes of measuring Segment EBITDA.
Corporate expenses are allocated on the basis of each segment’s relative EBITDA prior to the allocation.
Our measure of segment assets does not include cash, goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets, or corporate assets.
All goodwill is allocated to reporting units of our segments for purposes of impairment testing.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 1.0 million and 0.5 million, respectively, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive.
In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 0.3 million and 0.2 million, respectively, because the related performance conditions have not been satisfied.
Furthermore, for both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include the impact of preferred shares that are convertible into 6.9 million common shares, because deducting the preferred stock dividends from net income was more dilutive.
For purposes of calculating basic earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are not included in the calculation of basic weighted average shares outstanding until all necessary conditions have been satisfied and issuance of the shares underlying the restricted stock units is no longer contingent.
For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are included to the extent that they are dilutive.
In determining whether unvested restricted stock units are dilutive, each issuance of restricted stock units is considered separately.
Once a restricted stock unit has vested, it is included in the calculation of both basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
We have operating and finance leases for properties, including manufacturing facilities, warehouses, and office space; as well as vehicles and certain equipment.
We make certain judgments in determining whether a contract contains a lease in accordance with ASU 2016-02.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 16 years, some of which include options to extend the lease for a period of up to 15 years and some include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.
We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably certain as of the commencement date of the lease.
We have entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less.
These leases are not recorded on our balance sheet, and for the three months ended March 31, 2019, the rent expense for short-term leases was not material.
As the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, we use the incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments, which is unique to each leased asset, and is based upon the term of the lease, commencement date of the lease, local currency of the leased asset, and the credit rating of the legal entity leasing the asset.
