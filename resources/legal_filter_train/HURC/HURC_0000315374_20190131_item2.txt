Hurco Companies, Inc. is an international, industrial technology company operating in a single segment.
We design, manufacture and sell computerized (i.e., Computer Numeric Control or CNC) machine tools, consisting primarily of vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes), to companies in the metal cutting industry through a worldwide sales, service and distribution network.
Although the majority of our computer control systems and software products are proprietary, they predominantly use industry standard personal computer components.
Our computer control systems and software products are primarily sold as integral components of our computerized machine tool products.
We also provide machine tool components, software options, control upgrades, accessories and replacement parts for our products, as well as customer service, training and application support.
The following overview is intended to provide a brief explanation of the principal factors that have contributed to our recent financial performance.
During the first three months of fiscal 2019, approximately 48% of our revenues were attributable to customers in Europe, where we typically sell more of our higher-performance, higher-priced VMX series machines.
We also have our own direct sales and service organizations in China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and certain parts of the United States, which are among the world's principal machine tool consumption markets.
Components to support our SRT line of five-axis machining centers, such as the direct drive spindle, swivel head and rotary table, are manufactured by LCM in Italy.
Our sales to foreign customers are denominated, and payments by those customers are made, in the prevailing currencies in the countries in which those customers are located (primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan).
Our product costs are incurred and paid primarily in the New Taiwan Dollar and the U.S. Dollar.
For example, when the U.S. Dollar weakens in value relative to a foreign currency, sales made, and expenses incurred, in that currency when translated to U.S.
Dollars for reporting in our financial statements, are higher than would be the case when the U.S. Dollar is stronger.
In the comparison of our period-to-period results, we discuss the effect of currency translation on those results, which reflect translation to U.S.
Dollars at exchange rates prevailing during the period covered by those financial statements.
We seek to mitigate those risks through the use of various derivative instruments – principally foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
See Note 3 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Sales and Service Fees.
Sales and service fees for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $74.2 million, an increase of $5.8 million, or 8%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, and included an unfavorable currency impact of $2.5 million, or 4%, when translating foreign sales to U.S.
Dollars for financial reporting purposes.
Sales in the Americas for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by 39%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, and reflected improved U.S. market conditions and demand from U.S. customers for vertical milling machines
Dollars for financial reporting purposes, and decreased shipments of Hurco vertical milling machines in Italy and France.
Asian Pacific sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by 3%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, and included an unfavorable currency impact of 6%, when translating foreign sales to U.S.
Dollars for financial reporting purposes.
The increase in Asian Pacific sales for the first quarter of 2019 was primarily attributable to increased shipments of Hurco vertical milling machines in India and China, partially offset by decreased shipments of Takumi bridge mills in China.
† Amounts shown do not include computer control systems and software sold as an integrated component of computerized machine systems.
Sales of computerized machine tools for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by 7%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, and included an unfavorable currency impact of 4%.
The year-over-year increase in sales of computerized machine tools reflected increased shipments of Hurco vertical milling machines in the U.S., India and China, partially offset by decreased shipments of Takumi bridge mills in China and Hurco vertical milling machines in Italy, France and Germany.
Sales of computer control systems and software for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by 22%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, due primarily to increased sales in the U.S. and France.
Sales of service parts increased by 18% during the first quarter of 2019, compared to the corresponding prior year period, reflecting increased aftermarket sales of service parts across all three regions and product lines.
Sales of service fees for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by 6%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, due primarily to an increase in aftermarket service of Hurco products in Germany.
Orders in the Americas for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by 21%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
This increase was primarily attributable to increased customer demand in the U.S. for vertical milling machines.
European orders for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased by 25%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, and included an unfavorable currency impact of 4% when translating foreign orders to U.S.
Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $22.1 million, or 30% of sales, compared to $20.1 million, or 29% of sales, for the corresponding prior year period.
The year-over-year increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflected the increased volume of sales of vertical milling machines.
Operating Expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $13.9 million, or 19% of sales, compared to $13.0 million, or 19% of sales, in the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, and included a favorable currency impact of $0.5 million when translating foreign expenses to U.S.
Dollars for financial reporting purposes.
Operating Income.
Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $8.2 million compared to $7.2 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
The increase in operating income year-over-year was primarily driven by the increased volume of sales of vertical milling machines.
Other Income (Expense), Net.
Other income (expense), net in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by $0.4 million from the corresponding period in fiscal 2018 primarily due to foreign currency gains on transactions denominated in foreign currencies experienced in fiscal 2019 compared to foreign currency losses experienced in fiscal 2018.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 27%, compared to 61% in the corresponding prior year period.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to a one-time provisional adjustment related to the Tax Reform Act that was enacted in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
In addition, a one-time charge of $2.5 million related to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign income was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The impact of these charges increased the effective tax rate by approximately 39% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
At January 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $69.8 million, compared to $77.2 million at October 31, 2018.
Approximately 67% of the $69.8 million of cash and cash equivalents is denominated in U.S.
We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic working capital needs.
The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventories and decreases in accounts payable and in accrued payroll and employee benefits.
We funded these expenditures with cash on hand.
Effective as of December 31, 2018, we and our subsidiary Hurco B.V. entered into the 2018 Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as the lender.
In December 2018, in connection with our entry into the 2018 Credit Agreement, (1) using cash on hand, we repaid in full the $1.4 million outstanding under, and terminated, our credit facility in China and (2) we terminated our United Kingdom credit facility.
As a result, as of January 31, 2019, our existing credit facilities consist of our €1.5 million revolving credit facility in Germany and the $40.0 million revolving credit facility under the 2018 Credit Agreement.
At January 31, 2019, we had no debt or borrowings under any of our credit facilities.
At January 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of $41.7 million available for borrowing under our credit facilities and were in compliance with all covenants relating thereto.
We believe our cash position and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities provide adequate liquidity to fund our operations over the next twelve months and allow us to remain committed to our strategic plan of product innovation and targeted penetration of developing markets.
On March 6, 2019, HML, our wholly owned subsidiary in Taiwan, closed on an uncommitted revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate amount of 150 million New Taiwan Dollars, or approximately $5.0 million (the “Taiwan credit facility”).
The China credit facility has a final maturity date of March 5, 2020.
No amounts were outstanding under either of these credit facilities as of March 8, 2019.
There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the first three months of fiscal 2019.
There have been no material changes related to our contractual obligations and commitments from the information provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.
From time to time, our subsidiaries guarantee third party payment obligations in connection with the sale of machines to customers that use financing.
We follow FASB guidance for accounting for guarantees (codified in ASC 460).
As of January 31, 2019, we had 25 outstanding third party payment guarantees totaling approximately $687,000.
The terms of these guarantees are consistent with the underlying customer financing terms.
Upon shipment of a machine, the customer assumes the risk of ownership.
The customer does not obtain title, however, until the customer has paid for the machine.
A retention of title clause allows us to recover the machine if the customer defaults on the financing.
We accrue liabilities under these guarantees at fair value, which amounts are insignificant.
