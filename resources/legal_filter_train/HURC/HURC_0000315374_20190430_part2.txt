From time to time, we are involved in claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business.
Pursuant to applicable accounting rules, we accrue the minimum liability for each known claim when the estimated outcome is a range of possible loss and no one amount within that range is more likely than another.
We maintain insurance policies for such matters, and we record insurance recoveries when we determine such recovery to be probable.
We believe that the ultimate resolution of claims for any losses will not exceed our insurance policy coverages.
We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
This disclosure is made pursuant to Section 10A(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by Section 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
