From time to time, information provided by us, including but not limited to statements in this report, or other statements made by or on our behalf, may contain "forward-looking" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, performance, or achievements may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected.
Among the factors that could cause actual results to materially differ include: general business and economic conditions; difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, consummating a transaction on terms which we consider acceptable, and integration and performance of acquired businesses; difficulties in new product development; changes in competition and technology in the markets that we serve and the mix of our products required to address these changes; an inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, particularly in respect of our acquired businesses; uncertainty related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; delays or difficulties in implementing our cost management strategies; and other factors affecting our operations, markets, capacity to meet demand, products, services, and prices that are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
