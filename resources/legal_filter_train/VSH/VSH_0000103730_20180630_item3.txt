There have been no material developments to the legal proceedings previously disclosed. 
 Item 1A.  Risk Factors     
Except as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors we previously disclosed under Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2018. 
The liquidity of any trading market that currently exists for our convertible senior debentures may be adversely affected by the repurchase of $220.0 million and $69.1 million principal amounts of the convertible debentures due 2040 and due 2042, respectively, during the second fiscal quarter of 2018, and the holders of the remaining convertible debentures may be more likely to present their convertible debentures for conversion. 
Following the repurchase of convertible debentures by us in June 2018, 20% and approximately 54% of the original principal amount of the original issuances of convertible debentures due 2040 and due 2042, respectively, remain outstanding. Both the convertible debentures due 2040 and due 2042 are currently convertible at the option of the holders. As a result of the repurchase, the trading market for the remaining convertible debentures may be less liquid and more sporadic and prices may fluctuate significantly depending on the volume of trading in the debentures. This decreased liquidity may also make it more likely that the holders of the remaining debentures will present their debentures for conversion. At the direction of our Board of Directors, we intend, upon conversion, to repay the principal amounts of the convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, and the convertible senior notes, due 2025 in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock. 
The recorded and principal amount of our outstanding debt increased from approximately $370.5 million and $725.0 million, respectively as of December 31, 2017 to approximately $679.6 million and $981.9 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2018, primarily due to the issuance of the convertible senior notes due 2025. The carrying value of our convertible debt will continue to increase as the discount associated with the convertible instruments are amortized. Additionally, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the conditions contained in our existing debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. The marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future. 
Prior to three months before the respective maturity dates of our convertible senior debentures due 2040, 2041, and 2042, the holders of the debentures may only convert the debentures under specific circumstances as defined in the indentures governing the debentures. Prior to six months before the maturity date of our convertible senior notes due 2025, the holders of the notes may only convert the notes under specific circumstances as defined in the indentures governing the notes. As of June 30, 2018, our convertible senior debentures due 2040 and 2042 are convertible (See Note 6 to our consolidated condensed financial statements included in Item 1). Regardless of current convertibility of the debentures, GAAP requires convertible debentures to be included in the calculation of diluted EPS using either the "If Converted" or the "Treasury Stock Method" depending on our intent and ability to settle the debentures upon repurchase or conversion. The application of the "If Converted" method generally results in significantly more potentially dilutive securities compared to the "Treasury Stock Method." Pursuant to the indentures governing the respective debentures and notes, we have the right to pay the conversion value or purchase price for the debentures in cash, Vishay common stock, or a combination of both. At the direction of our Board of Directors, we intend, upon conversion, to repay the principal amounts of the debentures and notes and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock. Accordingly, the debentures and notes are included in the diluted EPS computation using the "Treasury Stock" method" rather than the "If Converted" method. If we were unable to employ the "Treasury Stock" method due to increased debt levels or changes in intentions, the number of potentially dilutive securities could increase significantly. 
 Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds     
In June 2018, the Company issued $600 million principal amount of 2.25% senior convertible notes due 2025 to qualified institutional investors. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase $220.0 million and $69.1 million principal amounts of convertible senior debentures due 2040 and 2042, respectively, for $585.0 million. The notes that Vishay repurchased had been convertible for 23,333,207 shares of Vishay common stock, assuming physical settlement. 
The convertible notes and common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. 
As a result of the obligations under the convertible notes upon conversion being payable in cash, shares of Vishay common stock, or a combination thereof, at the Company's option, as described in Note 6 to the consolidated condensed financial statements included Item 1, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes may constitute less than 1% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding.
