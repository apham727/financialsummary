•Advanced Products include our most recent product offerings and consist of the UltraScale+, UltraScale and 7-series product families and our Alveo boards products. 
•Core Products consist of all other product families.
These product categories are modified on a periodic basis to better reflect the maturity of the products and advances in technology. The most recent modification was made on April 3, 2016, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2017, whereby we reclassified our product categories to be consistent with how these categories are analyzed and reviewed internally. Specifically, we are grouping the products manufactured at the 28 nanometer (nm), 20nm and 16nm nodes into the Advanced Products category while all other products are grouped in the Core Products category.

Net revenues from Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer increased, in terms of absolute dollar, in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2020 from the comparable prior year periods.The increases were due primarily to higher sales from the Automotive business, and to a lesser extent from Audio, Video and Broadcast business.
Net revenues from Wired and Wireless increased significantly in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2020 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were due to higher sales from wireless business driven by the initial deployment ramp of 5G wireless networks, but were partially offset by lower sales from wireline business. 
Net revenues from Data Center increased, in terms of absolute dollar, in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2020 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were largely driven by higher sales in the Compute and Storage businesses.

Net revenues in Japan decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, but increased in the first six months of fiscal 2020 from the comparable prior year periods. The decrease in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower sales from Test, Measurement and Emulation, and Industrial, Scientific and Medical businesses.

The 43% and 31% increases in stock-based compensation expense for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2020, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods were primarily related to higher expenses associated with RSUs to remain competitive in employee compensation, as we granted RSUs at a higher fair value than in the prior years.
Our interest and other income, net was $12.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $6.4 million in the same prior year period. For the first six months of fiscal 2020, our interest and other income increased to $23.9 million from $3.6 million. The increases were due primarily to gains on the sale of investments during the fiscal 2020 period. 
The decrease in the effective tax rates in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same prior year periods was primarily due to an increase in excess tax benefits with respect to stock-based compensation and adjustments in the prior year periods to the provisional estimates previously recorded under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).
On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court (Tax Court) issued its opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, and, in a 15-0 decision, concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to stock-based compensation. The Commissioner appealed the Tax Court decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). The Ninth Circuit overturned the Tax Court’s decision in an opinion issued on July 24, 2018, but subsequently withdrew it. After rehearing the arguments on October 16, 2018, the Ninth Circuit issued a subsequent opinion on June 7, 2019. In a 2-1 decision, the Ninth Circuit overturned the Tax Court’s decision. On July 22, 2019, Altera filed a petition for an en banc rehearing with the Ninth Circuit, which will consist of a panel of 11 judges. In the case of a denial of a Ninth Circuit en banc rehearing or a decision against Altera following an en banc rehearing, Altera can appeal to the United States Supreme Court for review. Since the Altera decision is not yet final, we believe the law to be unsettled and continue to record tax benefits as we exclude stock-based compensation costs from our cost sharing arrangement. As of the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019, the potential impact of a final adverse decision to the consolidated statement of income could be as much as $45.0 million for prior years' taxes and interest. We will continue to monitor developments in the Altera case and the potential effect on our consolidated financial statements.
We have manufacturing operations in Singapore for which we have been granted "Pioneer Status" that is effective through fiscal 2021. The Pioneer Status reduces our local tax on Singapore income from a statutory rate of 17% to zero percent. Without obtaining a further Singapore incentive, the tax rate on Singapore income would increase to 17% beginning in fiscal 2022. During the quarter ended September 28, 2019, we received an award from the Singapore Economic Development Board for a Development and Expansion Incentive that will reduce our local tax on Singapore income from a statutory rate of 17% to 5%, effective for fiscal years 2022 through 2031.
