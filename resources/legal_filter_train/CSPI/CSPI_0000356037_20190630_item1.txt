This method is most appropriate as it depicts the measure of progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation.
Due to the complex nature of these contracts, there is significant judgment in allocating the transaction price.
For items sold separately, including hardware, software, professional services, maintenance contracts, other services, and third-party service contracts, there is no allocation performed as there is one performance obligation.

2014‑09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
The standard outlines a five-step model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied.
The standard also requires new, expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition.
The ASU replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP.
The new standard was adopted by the Company effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach only to contracts that were not completed as of adoption date.
The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
There were no previous period financial statement adjustments.
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016‑15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
This ASU will reduce diversity in practice for classifying cash payments and receipts in the statement of cash flows for a number of common transactions.
It will also clarify when identifiable cash flows should be separated versus classified based on their predominant source or use.
Beginning October 1, 2018, the Company adopted the ASU and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016‑16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
This ASU requires the seller and buyer to recognize at the transaction date the current and deferred income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers (except transfers of inventory).
Under current GAAP, the seller and buyer defer the consolidated tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer from the period of the transfer to a future period when the asset is transferred out of the consolidated group, or otherwise affects consolidated earnings.
Beginning October 1, 2018, the Company adopted the ASU and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

 In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
2018‑07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
Under this ASU companies will no longer be required to value non-employee awards differently from employee awards, but the accounting remains different for attribution and a contractual term election for valuing nonemployee equity share options.
Equity-classified awards to nonemployees will now be measured at the grant date using fair value of the equity instruments the company is obligated to issue and recognition is associated with the probable outcome.
Existing disclosure requirements within the stock compensation guidance also apply to nonemployee awards.
The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2018‑07 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
2018‑14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715‑20), Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
