Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve our principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of June 30, 2018, the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value. Our return on these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations.
As of June 30, 2018, we had investments in debt securities with effective maturities greater than one year of approximately $21.2 million. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalent investments primarily in money market funds with maturities of 90 days or less of $357.4 million and $350.9 million, respectively. 
We conduct business in certain foreign markets, primarily in Canada, Australia and the European Union. Our principal exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investment and inter-company debt in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, the Hong Kong Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the New Zealand Dollar, the Norwegian Kroner and the British Pound Sterling. If we are unable to settle our short-term inter-company debts in a timely manner, we remain exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. 
As currency exchange rates change, translation of the income statements of the international businesses into U.S. Dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results, the impact of which is immaterial to the comparisons set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
Historically, we have not hedged translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally; however, we may do so in the future. Our objective in managing foreign exchange risk is to minimize the potential exposure to changes that exchange rates might have on earnings, cash flows and financial position.
Foreign exchange losses for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $0.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $2.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The decrease in losses to our earnings in the current period were attributable to decreased inter-company debt between periods in foreign subsidiaries that were in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.
Cumulative translation adjustments, net of tax, included in other comprehensive income for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $(14.6) million and $12.3 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $(8.3) million and $15.9 million, respectively.
