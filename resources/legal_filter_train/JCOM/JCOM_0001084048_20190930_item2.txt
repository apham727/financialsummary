◦Sustain growth or profitability, particularly in light of an uncertain U.S. or worldwide economy and the related impact on customer acquisition and retention rates, customer usage levels, and credit and debit card payment declines;
J2 Global, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“J2 Global”, “the Company”, “our”, “us” or “we”), is a leading provider of internet services.
Through our Cloud Services business, we provide cloud services to consumers and businesses and license our intellectual property (“IP”) to third parties.
Our Digital Media business specializes in the technology, gaming, broadband, business to business, healthcare, and international markets offering content, tools and services to consumers and businesses.
Our Cloud Services business generates revenues primarily from customer subscription and usage fees and from IP licensing fees.
Our Digital Media business generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing and licensing fees.
In addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis we acquire businesses to grow our customer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies, acquire skilled personnel and enter into new markets.
Our consolidated revenues are currently generated from three basic business models, each with different financial profiles and variability.
Our Digital Media business is driven primarily by advertising revenues, has relatively higher sales and marketing expense and has seasonal strength in the fourth quarter.
Our critical accounting policies are described in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates.
The main focus of our Cloud Services offerings is to reduce or eliminate costs, increase sales and enhance productivity, mobility, business continuity and security of our customers as the technologies and devices they use evolve over time.
As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to enhance our existing offerings and offer new services to continue to satisfy the evolving needs of our customers.
In a given period, we may close greater or fewer acquisitions than in prior periods or acquisitions of greater or lesser significance than in prior periods.
Moreover, future acquisitions of businesses within this space but with different business models may impact Cloud Services’ overall profit margins.
Also, as IP licensing often involves litigation, the timing of licensing transactions is unpredictable and can and does vary significantly from period to period.
This variability can cause the overall business’s financial results to materially vary from period to period.
The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites and those included within our advertising networks, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience.
As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks.
The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those placed on third-party websites.
Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites.
However, the trend in advertising spend is shifting to mobile devices and other newer advertising formats which generally experience lower margins than those from desktop computers and tablets.
We expect this trend to continue to put pressure on our margins.
In a given period, we may close greater or fewer acquisitions than in prior periods or acquisitions of greater or lesser significance than in prior periods.
Our revenues consist of revenues from our Cloud Services business and from our Digital Media business.
Cloud Services revenues primarily consist of revenues from “fixed” customer subscription revenues and “variable” revenues generated from actual usage of our services.
Digital Media revenues primarily consist of advertising revenues, subscriptions earned through the granting of access to, or delivery of, certain data products or services to customers, fees paid for generating business leads, and licensing and sale of editorial content and trademarks.
Our revenues in 2019 have increased over the comparable three and nine month periods of 2018 primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth within both the Digital Media and Cloud Services businesses.
Sales and Marketing.
Our internet-based advertising relationships consist primarily of fixed cost and performance-based (cost-per-impression, cost-per-click and cost-per-acquisition) advertising relationships with an array of online service providers.
Advertising cost for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $40.6 million (primarily consists of $28.3 million of third-party advertising costs and $11.3 million of personnel costs) compared to 2018 of $36.3 million (primarily consists of $24.4 million of third-party advertising costs and $10.2 million of personnel costs).

The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to increased personnel costs and advertising associated with the acquisition of businesses acquired in and subsequent to the third quarter 2018 within the Media and Cloud Services businesses.
Research, Development and Engineering.
The increase in research, development and engineering costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to the third quarter 2018.
The increase in general and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets, increased depreciation expense, personnel costs relating to businesses acquired in and subsequent to the third quarter 2018; partially offset by lower bad debt expense.

Our interest expense, net is generated primarily from interest expense due to outstanding debt, partially offset by interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments.
Interest expense, net increased over the prior comparable periods primarily due to our line of credit borrowings.

When necessary, we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
