◦Sustain growth or profitability, particularly in light of an uncertain U.S. or worldwide economy and the related impact on customer acquisition and retention rates, customer usage levels, and credit and debit card payment declines;
j2 Global, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“j2 Global”, “the Company”, “our”, “us” or “we”), is a leading provider of internet services.
Through our Cloud Services segment, we provide cloud services to consumers and businesses and license our intellectual property (“IP”) to third parties.
Our Digital Media segment specializes in the technology, gaming, lifestyle and healthcare markets offering content, tools and services to consumers and businesses.
Our Cloud Services segment generates revenues primarily from customer subscription and usage fees and from IP licensing fees.
Our Digital Media segment generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing and licensing fees.
In addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis we acquire businesses to grow our customer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies, acquire skilled personnel and enter into new markets.
Our consolidated revenues are currently generated from three basic business models, each with different financial profiles and variability.
Our Cloud Services segment is driven primarily by subscription revenues that are relatively higher margin, stable and predictable from quarter to quarter with some seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter.
The Cloud Services segment also includes the results of our IP licensing business, which can vary dramatically in both revenues and profitability from period to period.
Our Digital Media segment is driven primarily by advertising revenues, has relatively higher sales and marketing expense and has seasonal strength in the fourth quarter.
Our critical accounting policies are described in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates.
The main focus of our Cloud Services offerings is to reduce or eliminate costs, increase sales and enhance productivity, mobility, business continuity and security of our customers as the technologies and devices they use evolve over time.
As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to enhance our existing offerings and offer new services to continue to satisfy the evolving needs of our customers.
In a given period, we may close greater or fewer acquisitions than in prior periods or acquisitions of greater or lesser significance than in prior periods.
Moreover, future acquisitions of businesses within this segment but with different business models may impact the segment’s overall profit margins.
Also, as IP licensing often involves litigation, the timing of licensing transactions is unpredictable and can and does vary significantly from period to period.
This variability can cause the overall segment’s financial results to materially vary from period to period.
The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites and those included within our advertising networks, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience.
As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks.
The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those placed on third-party websites.
Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites.
However, the trend in advertising spend is shifting to mobile devices and other newer advertising formats which generally experience lower margins than those from desktop computers and tablets.
We expect this trend to continue to put pressure on our margins.
In a given period, we may close greater or fewer acquisitions than in prior periods or acquisitions of greater or lesser significance than in prior periods.
Moreover, future acquisitions of businesses within this segment but with different business models may impact the segment’s overall profit margins.
We anticipate that the stable revenue trend in our Cloud Services segment combined with the improving revenue and profits in our Digital Media segment will result in overall improved revenue and profits for j2 Global on a consolidated basis, excluding the impact of any future acquisitions which can vary dramatically from period to period.
Our revenues consist of revenues from our Cloud Services segment and from our Digital Media segment.
Cloud Services revenues primarily consist of revenues from “fixed” customer subscription revenues and “variable” revenues generated from actual usage of our services.
Digital Media revenues is primarily derived from advertising revenues and subscription to services and information revenues consisting of fees paid for generating business leads, and licensing and sale of editorial content and trademarks.
Our revenues in 2018 have increased over the comparable three and six month periods of 2017 primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth within both the Digital Media and Cloud Services segments.
The increase in cost of revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to the second quarter 2017 that resulted in additional editorial and production, network operations, and online processing fees.
Sales and Marketing.
Our internet-based advertising relationships consist primarily of fixed cost and performance-based (cost-per-impression, cost-per-click and cost-per-acquisition) advertising relationships with an array of online service providers.
Advertising cost for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $36.2 million (primarily consists of $23.6 million of third-party advertising costs and $9.8 million of personnel costs) compared to 2017 of $34.4 million (primarily consists of $23.0 million of third-party advertising costs and $10.1 million of personnel costs).
2018 was $74.7 million (primarily consists of $48.9 million of third-party advertising costs and $20.3 million of personnel costs) compared to 2017 of $66.0 million (primarily consists of $43.7 million of third-party advertising costs and $20.1 million of personnel costs).
The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to increased personnel costs and advertising associated with the acquisition of businesses acquired in and subsequent to the second quarter 2017 within the Digital Media segment.
Research, Development and Engineering.
Research, development and engineering costs for the six months ended June 30, 2018 remained consistent with the prior comparable period.
The increase in general and administrative expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of fixed assets, personnel costs relating to businesses acquired in and subsequent to the second quarter 2017, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, severance costs associated with acquisitions and professional fees.
Interest expense, net.
Our interest expense, net is generated primarily from interest expense due to outstanding debt, partially offset by interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments.
Interest expense, net was $15.5 million and $13.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $31.3 million and $26.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Other expense, net.
Our other expense, net is generated primarily from miscellaneous items, gain or losses on currency exchange and gains or losses on investments.
Other expense, net was $0.4 million and $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The decrease over the prior comparable period is due to decreased losses on currency exchange.
Other expense, net was $4.9 million and $4.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase is primarily due to a loss on equity investments of $3.7 million; partially offset by decreased losses on currency exchange over the prior comparable period.
When necessary, we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017.
Consistent with guidance issued by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (“SAB 118”), the Company recorded provisional estimates for the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act in December 2017.
In addition, SAB 118 provides for a measurement period of one year from the enactment date to finalize the accounting for effects of the 2017 Tax Act.
We continue to analyze the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act and refine calculations.
The analysis included a preliminary assessment on the deductibility of certain amounts for which deferred tax assets may have been recorded.
As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an estimated tax benefit of approximately $33.3 million.
As of June 30, 2018, we did not adjust the provisional estimate related to re-measurement of deferred tax balances.
Therefore, the Company did not include a provisional amount for this item in its financial statements for fiscal 2017.
Therefore, we have not determined an accounting policy on the GILTI provisions.
However, the standard requires that we reflect the impact of the GILTI provisions as a period expense until the accounting policy is finalized.
Therefore, we have included the provisional estimate of GILTI related to current-year operations in its estimated annual effective tax rate only and will be updating the impact and accounting policy as the analysis related to the GILTI provisions is completed.
Provision for income taxes amounted to $7.0 million and $9.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $14.1 million and $18.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
