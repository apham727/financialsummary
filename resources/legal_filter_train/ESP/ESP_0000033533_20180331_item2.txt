Espey began operations after incorporation in New York in 1928. We strive to remain competitive as a leader in high power energy conversion and transformer solutions through the design and manufacture of new and improved products by using advanced and “cutting edge” electronics technologies. 
There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company from divisions of the largest electronic companies, as well as many small companies. The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products. The principal methods of competition for electronic products of both a military and industrial nature include, among other factors, price, product performance, the experience of the particular company and history of its dealings in such products. 
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff. This effort will keep our manufacturing team busy while the products being developed transition to production.  
Successful conversion of engineering program backlog into sales is largely dependent on the execution and completion of our engineering design efforts. It is not uncommon to experience technical or scheduling delays which arise from time to time as a result of, among other reasons, design complexity, the availability of personnel with the requisite expertise, and the requirements to obtain customer approval at various milestones. Cost overruns which may arise from technical and schedule delays could negatively impact the timing of the conversion of backlog into sales, or the profitability of such sales. We are currently experiencing some technical and schedule delays with our major development programs which are being resolved as they arise. Engineering programs in both the funded and unfunded portions of the current backlog aggregate $8.8 million. 
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2018 to be higher than revenues during fiscal year 2017. This expectation is driven primarily by orders already in the backlog and due to the commencement of shipments on a significant military contract from the Federal Government for a power supply we designed in-house and was qualified by the applicable government agency in the later part of fiscal year 2017. 
New orders received in the nine months of fiscal year 2018 were approximately $28.6 million as compared to $16.8 million of new orders received in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017. It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $7.0 million of orders comprising the March 31, 2018 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. The minimum of $7.0 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. The estimate of the March 31, 2018 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2018 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate. 
Net sales to two significant customers represented 50.6% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 and net sales to two significant customers represented 40.7% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Net sales to two significant customers represented 58.6% and 43.2% of the Company’s total sales for the nine-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This high concentration level with these customers presents significant risk. A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could significantly impact the Company. Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year. Management continues to pursue opportunities with current and new customers with an overall objective of lowering the concentration of sales and mitigating excessive reliance upon a single major product of a particular program or minimizing the impact of the loss of a single significant customer. 
A significant portion of our business is comprised of development and production contracts. Generally revenues on long-term fixed-price contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. 
Percentage of completion accounting requires judgment relative to expected sales, estimating costs and making assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedules. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of overhead costs. The estimation of cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Given the significance of the estimation processes and judgments described above, it is possible that materially different amounts of expected sales and contract costs could be recorded if different assumptions were used, based on changes in circumstances, in the estimation process. When a change in expected sales value or estimated cost is determined, changes are reflected in current period earnings. 
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, gross profits were $1,255,204 and $1,128,505, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 22.2% and 21.2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, gross profits were $5,791,956 and $3,552,397, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 23.5% and 20.8%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary factors in determining the change in gross profit and net income are overall sales levels and product mix. The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production. In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” meaning engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales. In any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin programs and less mature programs, and expenditures associated with loss contracts, has a significant impact on gross profit and net income. The gross profit percentage increased in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to product mix, offset in part, by an increase in expenditures incurred related to engineering design investments. The gross profit percentage increased in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to an increase in sales while expenditures incurred related to engineering design investments remained comparable to those incurred in the same period in 2017. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $895,129 for the three months ended March 31, 2018; an increase of $110,540, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,756,319 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018; an increase of $448,683 compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 relates primarily to the increase in employee compensation costs and professional services. The increase for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 relates primarily to the increase in employee compensation costs, professional services, outside selling expenses incurred for outside sales representatives, and freight due to an increase in shipments.  
Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, was $56,112 and $47,399, respectively. Other income for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, was $140,797 and $85,076, respectively. The increase for the three and nine months is primarily due an increase in interest income resulting from the increase in investment securities. Interest income is a function of the level of investments and investment strategies which generally tend to be conservative.  
The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, were 23.6% and 25.2%, respectively, compared to 28.7% and 29.0% for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017. The effective tax rate is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit the Company receives on its “qualified production activities” under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the benefit derived from the ESOP dividends paid on allocated shares. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 uses a blended statutory tax rate which factors the reduction in the corporate statutory tax rate authorized under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) effective on January 1, 2018. The Company remeasured certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%, and provisionally recorded a net income tax expense of $35,200 related to the remeasurement in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.  
Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $317,764 or $0.14 per share both basic and diluted, respectively compared to $279,173 or $0.12 per share both basic and diluted, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, was $2,375,399 or $1.02 per share both basic and diluted compared to $944,076 or $0.41 per share both basic and diluted for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net income per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was mainly due to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales and a higher gross profit percentage resulting from product mix offset, in part, by an increase in engineering design investments. In addition, the company received a benefit in the current period from the reduction in the Company’s effective tax rate discussed above. The increase was offset, in part, by an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily related to employee compensation costs related to an increase in headcount.

The Company's working capital as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $30.0 million and $29.7 million, respectively. During the three and nine-months ended March 31, 2018 the Company repurchased 0 and 4,798 shares of its common stock from the Company’s Employee Retirement Plan and Trust (“ESOP”) for a purchase price of $0 and $109,694, respectively. During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 the Company repurchased 0 and 1,663 shares of its common stock from the ESOP for a purchase price of $0 and $44,335, respectively. Under existing authorizations from the Company's Board of Directors, as of March 31, 2018, management is authorized to purchase an additional $876,297 of Company stock. 
The Company currently believes that the cash flow generated from operations and when necessary, from cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its long-term funding requirements for the foreseeable future. 
During the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company expended $632,023 and $331,686, respectively, for plant improvements and new equipment. The Company has budgeted approximately $2.5 million for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal year 2018. As of March 31, 2018, purchase commitments for plant improvements and new equipment totaled $533,100. Management anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations. 
Management also believes that the Company's reserve for bad debts of $3,000 is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business. Historically, bad debt expense has been minimal.
