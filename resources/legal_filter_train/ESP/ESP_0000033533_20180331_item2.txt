Espey services include design and development to specification, build to print, design services, design studies, environmental testing services, metal fabrication, painting services, and development of automatic testing equipment.
Portions of the manufacturing and testing process are subcontracted to vendors from time to time.
There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company from divisions of the largest electronic companies, as well as many small companies.
The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
Our business is not seasonal.
However, the concentration of our business in the rail industry, and in equipment for military applications and industrial applications and our customer concentrations expose us to on-going associated risks.
These risks include, without limitation, requirements for power supplies in the rail industry, dependence on appropriations from the United States Government and the governments of foreign nations, program allocations, the potential of governmental termination of orders for convenience, and the general strength of the industry sectors in which our customers transact business.
Uncertainty in federal defense spending and future procurement needs supporting the rail industry continues to drive competition.
Accordingly, we adjust our pricing strategy in order to achieve a balance which enables us both to retain repeat programs while being more competitive in bidding on new programs.
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff.
Successful conversion of engineering program backlog into sales is largely dependent on the execution and completion of our engineering design efforts.
We are currently experiencing some technical and schedule delays with our major development programs which are being resolved as they arise.
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2018 to be higher than revenues during fiscal year 2017.
New orders received in the nine months of fiscal year 2018 were approximately $28.6 million as compared to $16.8 million of new orders received in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $7.0 million of orders comprising the March 31, 2018 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
The minimum of $7.0 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
The estimate of the March 31, 2018 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2018 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing in excess of $68.4 million in the aggregate as of May 1, 2018 for both repeat and new programs.
The outstanding quotations encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies, transformers, and subassemblies.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any of the anticipated orders described above, many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 50.6% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 and net sales to two significant customers represented 40.7% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 58.6% and 43.2% of the Company’s total sales for the nine-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
This high concentration level with these customers presents significant risk.
Generally revenues on long-term fixed-price contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion.
Percentage of completion accounting requires judgment relative to expected sales, estimating costs and making assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedules.
The estimation of cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 22.2% and 21.2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, gross profits were $5,791,956 and $3,552,397, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 23.5% and 20.8%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” meaning engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales.
The gross profit percentage increased in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to product mix, offset in part, by an increase in expenditures incurred related to engineering design investments.
The gross profit percentage increased in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to an increase in sales while expenditures incurred related to engineering design investments remained comparable to those incurred in the same period in 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $895,129 for the three months ended March 31, 2018; an increase of $110,540, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,756,319 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018; an increase of $448,683 compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 relates primarily to the increase in employee compensation costs and professional services.
Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, was $56,112 and $47,399, respectively.
Other income for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, was $140,797 and $85,076, respectively.
The increase for the three and nine months is primarily due an increase in interest income resulting from the increase in investment securities.
Interest income is a function of the level of investments and investment strategies which generally tend to be conservative.
The effective tax rate is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit the Company receives on its “qualified production activities” under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the benefit derived from the ESOP dividends paid on allocated shares.
The Company remeasured certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%, and provisionally recorded a net income tax expense of $35,200 related to the remeasurement in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $317,764 or $0.14 per share both basic and diluted, respectively compared to $279,173 or $0.12 per share both basic and diluted, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Net income for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, was $2,375,399 or $1.02 per share both basic and diluted compared to $944,076 or $0.41 per share both basic and diluted for the nine months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in net income per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was mainly due to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales and a higher gross profit percentage resulting from product mix offset, in part, by an increase in engineering design investments.
In addition, the company received a benefit in the current period from the reduction in the Company’s effective tax rate discussed above.
The increase was offset, in part, by an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily related to employee compensation costs related to an increase in headcount.

The Company's working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business, and during the past two fiscal years, the Company, when possible, has funded all of its operations with cash flows resulting from operating activities and when necessary from its existing cash and investments.
The Company did not borrow any funds during the last two fiscal years.
Management has available a $3,000,000 line of credit to help fund further growth or working capital and letter of credit needs, if necessary, but does not anticipate the need for any borrowed funds in the foreseeable future.
Contingent liabilities on outstanding standby letters of credit agreements aggregated to zero at March 31, 2018 and 2017.
The Company's working capital as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $30.0 million and $29.7 million, respectively.
During the three and nine-months ended March 31, 2018 the Company repurchased 0 and 4,798 shares of its common stock from the Company’s Employee Retirement Plan and Trust (“ESOP”) for a purchase price of $0 and $109,694, respectively.
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 the Company repurchased 0 and 1,663 shares of its common stock from the ESOP for a purchase price of $0 and $44,335, respectively.
Under existing authorizations from the Company's Board of Directors, as of March 31, 2018, management is authorized to purchase an additional $876,297 of Company stock.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 compared to the prior period relates primarily to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories and a reduction in accounts payable offset, in part, by an increase in net income resulting from higher sales in the current period.
Net cash used in investing activities was less in the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior period due to the purchase of a single significant security in the prior period.
In addition, more shares were purchased from the Company’s ESOP in the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.
This was offset, in part, from an increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options during the first nine months ended March 31, 2018 when compared with the same period in 2017.
The Company currently believes that the cash flow generated from operations and when necessary, from cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its long-term funding requirements for the foreseeable future.
During the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company expended $632,023 and $331,686, respectively, for plant improvements and new equipment.
The Company has budgeted approximately $2.5 million for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal year 2018.
As of March 31, 2018, purchase commitments for plant improvements and new equipment totaled $533,100.
Management anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations.
Management also believes that the Company's reserve for bad debts of $3,000 is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business.
