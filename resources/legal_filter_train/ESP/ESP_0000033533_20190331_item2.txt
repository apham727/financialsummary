Espey began operations after incorporation in New York in 1928. We strive to remain competitive as a leader in high power energy conversion and transformer solutions through the design and manufacture of new and improved products by using advanced and “cutting edge” electronics technologies. 
There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company, ranging from divisions of the largest electronic companies, to many small companies. The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products. The principal methods of competition for electronic products of both a military and industrial nature include, among other factors, price, product performance, the experience of the particular company and history of its dealings in such products. 
Our business is not seasonal. However, the concentration of our business in the rail industry, and in equipment for military applications and industrial applications, and our customer concentrations expose us to on-going associated risks. These risks include, without limitation, requirements for power supplies in the rail industry, dependence on appropriations from the United States Government and the governments of foreign nations, program allocations, the potential of governmental termination of orders for convenience, and the general strength of the industry sectors in which our customers transact business. 
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff. This effort will keep our manufacturing team busy while engineering development designs transition to production. 
Successful conversion of engineering program backlog into sales is largely dependent on the execution and completion of our engineering design efforts. It is not uncommon to experience technical or scheduling delays which arise from time to time as a result of, among other reasons, design complexity, the availability of personnel with the requisite expertise, and the requirements to obtain customer approval at various milestones. Cost overruns which may arise from technical and schedule delays could negatively impact the timing of the conversion of backlog into sales, or the profitability of such sales. While recently, we have experienced technical and schedule delays with our major development programs, these delays have been resolved as they arise and we do not expect any negative impact on our customer order fulfillment projections for fiscal year 2019. Engineering programs in both the funded and unfunded portions of the current backlog aggregate $5.6 million.  
New orders received in the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 were approximately $22.2 million as compared to $28.6 million of new orders received in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $12.2 million of orders comprising the March 31, 2019 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. The minimum of $12.2 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. The estimate of the March 31, 2019 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2019 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate. 
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers. Net sales to two significant customers represented 47.2% and 50.6% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net sales to three significant customers represented 58.1% of the Company’s total sales for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2019 and net sales to two significant customers represented 58.6% of the Company's total sales for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2018. This high concentration level with these customers presents significant risk. A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could significantly impact the Company. Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year. 
Management believes our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on our contracts. 
We account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable. We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time, or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. 
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligation. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations. We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. The transaction price for each performance obligation is based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. Transaction prices on our contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) are typically based on estimated costs plus a reasonable profit margin. 
We recognize revenue using the output method based on the appraisal of results achieved and milestones reached or units delivered based on contractual shipment terms, typically shipping point. 
Inventoried work relating to contracts in process and work in process is valued at actual production cost, including factory overhead incurred to date. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor, and an allocation of overhead costs. Work in process represents spare units and parts and other inventory items acquired or produced to service units previously sold or to meet anticipated future orders. Provision for losses on contracts is made when the existence of such losses becomes probable and estimable. The provision for losses on contracts is included in other accrued expenses on the Company’s balance sheet. The costs attributed to units delivered under contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced. Certain contracts are expected to extend beyond twelve months. 
Net sales increased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 to $9,218,141 as compared to $5,663,161 for the same period in 2018. Net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 increased to $24,858,649 as compared to $24,690,689 for the same period in 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the increase in net sales is primarily due to an increase in magnetic sales consisting of certain engineering deliverables and product shipments on a specific long-term program, as well as, an increase in power supply shipments supporting the rail industry. For the nine months ended March 31, 2019, the slight increase in net sales is primarily due to an increase in build to print sales for product which had no shipments in the prior fiscal year, an increase in magnetic sales for the reasons discussed above, offset, in part, by a decrease in power supply shipments. Although shipments supporting the rail industry remain strong, the overall decline in power supply shipments in the current fiscal year relates primarily to the timing of shipments related to a specific military contract which had significant shipments in the prior fiscal year. 
Gross profits for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2,150,439 and $1,255,204, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 23.3% and 22.2%, for the same periods, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, gross profits were $4,659,608 and $5,791,956, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 18.7% and 23.5%, for the same periods, respectively. The primary factors in determining the change in gross profit and net income are overall sales levels and product mix. The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production. In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” meaning engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales. In any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin programs and less mature programs, and expenditures associated with loss contracts, has a significant impact on gross profit and net income. The gross profit percentage increased in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in sales while expenditures incurred during the period related to engineering design investments remained comparable to those incurred in the same period in 2018 offset, in part, by a slight overall decline in the gross profit percentage on product shipments. The gross profit percentage decreased in the nine months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the increase in expenditures incurred related to engineering design investments primarily pertaining to a specific contract while sales for the period remained flat when compared to the same period in 2018. This increase in spending on the specific engineering design contract reduced the gross profit percentage by 5.9% for the nine months ended March 31, 2019. The gross profit percentage was further reduced by a slight overall decline in the gross profit percentage on product shipments. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,069,070 for the three months ended March 31, 2019; an increase of $173,941, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $3,374,301 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019; an increase of $617,982 compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2018. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 relates primarily to the increase in employee compensation costs associated with added program management personnel supporting the Company’s sales backlog and professional services. The increase for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 relates primarily to an increase in employee compensation costs, professional services, and other miscellaneous expenses offset, in part, by a reduction in travel and incurred marketing costs. 
Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was $45,254 and $56,112, respectively. Other income for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was $174,686 and $140,797, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended is primarily due to the reduction in investment securities offset, in part, by the gradual increase in the current yield percentages earned on the investment securities. The increase in the nine months ended is primarily due an increase in interest income resulting from the gradual increase in current yield percentages earned on investment securities offset, in part, by a reduction in investment securities. Interest income is a function of the level of investments and investment strategies which generally tend to be conservative.  
The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019, were 18.1% and 17.7%, respectively, compared to 23.6% and 25.2% for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018. The statutory tax rate was reduced from 34% to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act’) effective on January 1, 2018. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit derived from the ESOP dividends paid on allocated shares and for the tax benefit received in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the exercise of stock options. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit the Company received on its “qualified production activities” under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 which expired after the end of fiscal 2018 and the benefit derived from the ESOP dividends paid on allocated shares. 
The Company's working capital as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $27.2 million and $30.0 million, respectively. During the three and nine-month period ended March 31, 2019, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock from the Company’s Employee Retirement Plan and Trust (“ESOP”). During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 the Company repurchased 0 and 4,798 shares of its common stock from the ESOP for a purchase price of $0 and $109,694. Under existing authorizations from the Company's Board of Directors, as of March 31, 2019, management is authorized to purchase an additional $876,297 of Company stock. 
The Company currently believes that the cash flow generated from operations and when necessary, from cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its long-term funding requirements for the foreseeable future. 
During the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company expended $538,550 and $632,023, respectively, for plant improvements and new equipment. The Company has budgeted approximately $750,000 for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal year 2019. Management anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations. 
Management believes that the Company's reserve for bad debts of $3,000 is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business. Historically, bad debt expense has been minimal.
