In addition to Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin, we believe that the most important financial and non-financial measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per diluted share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable and certain receivables due from vendors plus days of supply in Merchandise inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable and Accounts payable-inventory financing, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.

We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 below.
Non-GAAP operating income was $1,026 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, an increase of $109 million, or 11.9%, compared to $917 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

We finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations. As of September 30, 2019, we also have $1.1 billion of availability for borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and an 
As of September 30, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $3.3 billion, of which $1.5 billion was secured indebtedness. At September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures. 
We have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. For additional details, see Note 4 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock for $493 million under the previously announced share repurchase program. For additional details on our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
On October 31, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.380 per common share. The dividend will be paid on December 10, 2019 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 25, 2019.
The cash conversion cycle decreased to 17 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 18 days at September 30, 2018. DSO, DIO and DPO increased 1 day, 1 day and 3 days, respectively, compared to September 30, 2018. The increase in DSO was primarily driven by higher Net sales and third-party services such as Software as a Service and warranties. These sales have an unfavorable impact on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis. This was partially offset by favorable timing of collections. Higher Net sales and third-party services also result in a favorable impact on DPO as the payable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets without a corresponding Cost of sales in the Statement of Operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to Net sales. Additionally, DIO increased due to higher customer-driven stocking positions.
Net cash used in investing activities increased $97 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to September 30, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the completion of our acquisition of Scalar on February 1, 2019 for $75 million. Additionally, Capital expenditures increased $22 million primarily due to investments for improvements to our information technology systems.
Net cash used in financing activities increased $133 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to September 30, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by our share repurchases and increasing dividends per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, which were partially offset by refinancing of our 2023 Senior Notes through the issuance of 2028 Senior Notes, further leveraging of our inventory financing arrangements and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. For additional details regarding our debt activities, see Note 7 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Except as disclosed above under "Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements," there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
