CDW Corporation ("Parent") is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ("IT") solutions to small, medium and large business, and government, education and healthcare customers in the United States ("US"), the United Kingdom ("UK") and Canada.
Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration.
We are technology "agnostic," with a portfolio including more than 100,000 products and services from more than 1,000 leading and emerging brands.
Our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments through over 6,000 customer-facing coworkers, including sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers.
We are a leading sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our "vendor partners"), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer.
We provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access.
Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended ("Topic 606"), utilizing the full retrospective method as discussed in Note 2 (Recent Accounting Pronouncements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Prior period amounts have been adjusted accordingly.
This is particularly the case for business customers, as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects, which are driven by their perceptions of business conditions.
•Changes in spending policies, budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers.
•Technology trends drive customer purchasing behaviors in the market.
These trends are driving customer adoption of solutions such as those delivered via cloud, software defined architectures and hybrid on-premise and off-premise combinations.
We monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary.
We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker and coworker turnover.
These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
In this Form 10-Q, we discuss Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.
Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility ("Term Loan"), which is used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments.
For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
For the definitions of Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations to Net income, see "Results of Operations."

Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, constant currency Net sales growth was 7.0%.
See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" below for additional information regarding constant currency Net sales growth.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018, ongoing focus on client device refresh across all customer-end markets, except Federal, coupled with strong results from our international operations, drove Net sales growth.

Both operations had strong growth in local currency as we continued to take share in the local markets.
In addition, UK growth was driven in part by increased sales from referrals for US-based customers.
The impact of foreign currency exchange increased Other sales growth by approximately 700 basis points, due to the favorable impact resulting from the British pound and Canadian dollar to US dollar translations.

This was driven by higher sales payroll costs, including sales commissions primarily due to higher Gross profit dollars, partially offset by lower equity-based compensation expense and the associated payroll taxes due to the vesting in the prior year of an equity grant made at the time of our initial public offering.
As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses decreased 20 basis points to 9.1% during the three months ended June 30, 2018, down from 9.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2017.

Other operating margin percentage increased 110 basis points to 4.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from 3.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Also contributing to the increased operating margin percentage is the non-recurrence of integration expenses in the current year.
Income tax expense was $57 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $54 million for the same period of the prior year.
The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily attributable to the reduction in the US federal statutory rate, partially offset by lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation and a higher effective net state income tax rate primarily due to the reduced US federal benefit.
We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 below.
EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales.
Consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.
Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments.
For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" below for additional information regarding constant currency Net sales growth.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018, growth was driven by ongoing focus on client device refresh within hardware and strong growth from our international operations.
In addition, increased sales of solutions-based hardware reflected both underlying demand as well as the impact of the reversal associated with supply chain issues experienced at the end of 2017.
Corporate segment Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $279 million, or 9.2% compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.

We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 below.
See the "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" section included above for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 for all Non-GAAP measure definitions.

We finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations.
As of June 30, 2018, we also have $1.1 billion of availability for borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and an additional £40 million ($53 million at June 30, 2018) under the CDW UK revolving credit facility.
Our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our operating commitments, which primarily include the purchase of inventory, payroll and general expenses.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock for $176 million under the previously announced share repurchase program.
For more information on our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
On August 2, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per common share.
The dividend will be paid on September 10, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 24, 2018.
In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, in each case, under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness.
The cash conversion cycle increased to 17 days at June 30, 2018 compared to 16 days at June 30, 2017 as DSO, DIO and DPO each increased 1 day compared to June 30, 2017.
The increase in DSO was primarily driven by higher Net sales and related Accounts receivable for third-party services such as software as a service and warranties.
on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis.
This also results in a favorable impact on DPO as the payable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet without a corresponding Cost of sales in the Statement of Operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to Net sales.
The decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the timing of investments for improvements to our information technology systems.
The decrease was primarily driven by fewer share repurchases during the six months ended June 30, 2018, which resulted in a $183 million decrease in cash used in financing activities.
For more information on our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
As of June 30, 2018, we had total indebtedness of $3.2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was secured indebtedness.

These amounts are classified separately as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due.
For further details, see Note 3 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Except as disclosed under Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
