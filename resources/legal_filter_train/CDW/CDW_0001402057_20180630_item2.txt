We monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
In this Form 10-Q, we discuss Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Total Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $294 million, or 7.6%, to $4,186 million, compared to $3,892 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, constant currency Net sales growth was 7.0%. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" below for additional information regarding constant currency Net sales growth.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018, ongoing focus on client device refresh across all customer-end markets, except Federal, coupled with strong results from our international operations, drove Net sales growth. 
Corporate segment Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $154 million, or 9.7%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017. Growth was primarily driven by client device refresh, as well as ongoing success helping customers with solutions, including data center and software.
Small Business segment Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased by $15 million, or 4.6%, between periods. Sales growth was primarily driven by client device refresh.
Gross profit increased $55 million, or 8.6%, to $696 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $641 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 16.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Gross profit margin improvement primarily reflected the positive impact on product margin due to customer mix.
Selling and administrative expenses increased $17 million, or 4.9%, to $381 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $364 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. This was driven by higher sales payroll costs, including sales commissions primarily due to higher Gross profit dollars, partially offset by lower equity-based compensation expense and the associated payroll taxes due to the vesting in the prior year of an equity grant made at the time of our initial public offering. Total coworker count was 8,917, up 130 from 8,787 at June 30, 2017. Total coworker count was 8,726 at December 31, 2017.

Total operating margin percentage increased 40 basis points to 6.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from 5.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Operating margin was positively impacted by the increase in Gross profit margin, driven by improved product margin. Also contributing to the increased operating margin percentage were lower equity-based compensation expenses and the associated payroll taxes, the non-recurrence of integration expenses in the current year and intangible asset amortization expenses as a percentage of Net sales, which do not trend in line with sales movement. 
Corporate segment income from operations was $141 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $14 million, or 11.4%, compared to $127 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Corporate segment income from operations increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars driven by higher sales. Corporate segment operating margin 
percentage increased 10 basis points to 8.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from 8.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2017. This increase in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by the benefit of lower Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales. This was partially offset by product margin compression due to increased hardware sales.
Small Business segment income from operations was $25 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $6 million, or 26.8%, compared to $19 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.

Public segment income from operations increased primarily due to higher Gross profit dollars driven by improved product margin. Public segment operating margin percentage increased 50 basis points to 6.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from 6.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2017. This increase in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by higher product margin and the benefit of lower sales payroll expenses as a percentage of Net sales.
Other income from operations was $22 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $9 million, or 73.7%, compared to $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Other income from operations increased primarily due to higher sales volumes and Gross profit as we continue to take share in the local markets, and favorable foreign exchange. Other operating margin percentage increased 110 basis points to 4.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from 3.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to lower sales payroll expenses and intangible asset amortization as a percentage of Net sales. Also contributing to the increased operating margin percentage is the non-recurrence of integration expenses in the current year. 
The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily attributable to the reduction in the US federal statutory rate, partially offset by lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation and a higher effective net state income tax rate primarily due to the reduced US federal benefit.
We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 below. 
Non-GAAP income before income taxes and Non-GAAP net income exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and associated taxes, gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt and integration expenses. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales. Consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
We believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments. For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Non-GAAP net income was $213 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $50 million, or 30.8%, compared to $163 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.

Net sales in Healthcare increased 6.8%, primarily driven by performance in desktops and video products as customers move forward on refresh projects. Net sales to Government customers grew at 1.5% and increased $14 million. Sales to State and Local government customers were driven by the success of executing against recently added contracts. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Federal sales primarily due to lower client device and networking sales.

Gross profit increased $105 million, or 8.8%, to $1,300 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $1,194 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit margin remained flat compared to the prior year at 16.7%.
