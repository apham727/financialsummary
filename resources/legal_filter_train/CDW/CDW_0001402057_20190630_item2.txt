We monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. Effective January 1, 2019, we made a change to the Non-GAAP financial measures that we use to provide meaningful methods of evaluating our financial performance and have replaced EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin with Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin. We made this change due to the continuing evolution of the IT consumption model. We believe Non-GAAP operating income will be more reflective of the costs of providing services to our customers and our own costs as the consumption model continues to evolve. Non-GAAP operating income is also being used for the first time in 2019 as a key business metric for our annual incentive compensation programs.
In addition to Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin, we believe that the most important financial and non-financial measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per diluted share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable and certain receivables due from vendors plus days of supply in Merchandise inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable and Accounts payable-inventory financing, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.

Gross profit increased $78 million, or 11.2%, to $774 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $696 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 16.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2019. Gross profit margin was positively impacted by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues that are booked net of costs of goods sold, such as warranties and Software-as-a-Service. This was partially offset by year-over-year Net sales growth out-pacing the year-over-year growth in partner funding. 
As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses remained flat at 9.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2019.
During the first quarter of 2019, we evaluated our methodology for allocating certain depreciation and amortization expenses to each of our segments. The evaluation resulted in a revision to the allocation of depreciation and amortization expenses from Headquarters to our reportable segments, effective January 1, 2019. The prior period results have been recast to reflect these changes and present comparable information.

We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 below.
Non-GAAP operating income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and the associated payroll taxes, and acquisition and integration expenses. Non-GAAP operating income margin is defined as Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of Net sales. Non-GAAP income before income taxes, and Non-GAAP net income exclude, among other things, charges related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and the associated tax effects of each. Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margin, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.

Net sales in Education increased 6.7% on an average daily sales basis, primarily driven by video and client devices.
Net sales in Other, which is comprised of results from our UK and Canadian operations, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased $94 million, or 9.6%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018. On an average daily sales basis, Net sales in Other increased 10.5%. Both operations grew in local currency and Canada growth included the incremental Net sales from Scalar. The impact of foreign currency exchange decreased Other sales growth by approximately 610 basis points, due to the unfavorable impact resulting from the British pound and Canadian dollar to US dollar translations.
Gross profit increased $146 million, or 11.3%, to $1,446 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $1,300 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.

During the first quarter of 2019, we evaluated our methodology for allocating certain depreciation and amortization expenses to each of our segments. The evaluation resulted in a revision to the allocation of depreciation and amortization expenses from Headquarters to our reportable segments, effective January 1, 2019. The prior period results have been recast to reflect these changes and present comparable information.

Other Operating income was $45 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $3 million, or 7.8%, compared to $42 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Other Operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher payroll expenses and the unfavorable translation of the British pound and Canadian dollar to US dollar. Other operating margin percentage decreased 10 basis points to 4.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2019, from 4.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2018.

We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 below.
Non-GAAP net income was $423 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $47 million, or 12.5%, compared to $376 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
As of June 30, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $3.3 billion, of which $1.6 billion was secured indebtedness. At June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures. For additional details, see Note 7 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. For additional details, see Note 4 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our common stock for $332 million under the previously announced share repurchase program. For additional details on our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
On July 31, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.295 per common share. The dividend will be paid on September 10, 2019 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 26, 2019.
The cash conversion cycle decreased to 16 days at June 30, 2019, compared to 17 days at June 30, 2018. DSO, DIO and DPO increased 2, 1 and 4 days, respectively, compared to June 30, 2018. The increase in DSO was primarily driven by higher Net sales and third-party services such as software as a service and warranties. These sales have an unfavorable impact on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis. This also results in a favorable impact on DPO as the payable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets without a corresponding Cost of sales in the Statement of Operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to Net sales. In addition to the impact of these services on DPO, DPO also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms. Additionally, DIO increased due to higher customer-driven and strategic stocking positions.
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $85 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the completion of our acquisition of Scalar on February 1, 2019. Additionally, Capital expenditures were $44 million and $34 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to the timing of investments for improvements to our information technology systems.
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $33 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by further leveraging our inventory financing arrangements and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, which were partially offset by our share repurchases and increasing our dividends per share during the six months ended June 30, 2019. For additional details regarding our debt activities, see Note 7 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
