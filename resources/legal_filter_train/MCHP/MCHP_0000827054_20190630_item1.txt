The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
Note 3. Business Acquisitions
On May 29, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Microsemi Corporation, a publicly traded company headquartered in Aliso Viejo, California.
The Company paid an aggregate of approximately $8.19 billion in cash to the stockholders of Microsemi.
The total consideration transferred in the acquisition, including approximately $53.9 million of non-cash consideration for the exchange of certain share-based payment awards of Microsemi for stock awards of the Company, was approximately $8.24 billion.
In addition to the consideration transferred, the Company recognized in its consolidated financial statements $3.23 billion in liabilities of Microsemi consisting of debt, taxes payable and deferred, restructuring, and contingent and other liabilities of which $2.06 billion of existing debt was paid off.
The Company financed the purchase price using approximately $8.10 billion of borrowings consisting of $3.10 billion under its amended and restated revolving line of credit (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), $3.00 billion of term loans ("Term Loan Facility") provided under the Company's amended and restated credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), and $2.00 billion in newly issued senior secured notes.
The Company incurred $22.0 million in acquisition costs related to the acquisition.
As a result of the acquisition, Microsemi became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
Microsemi offers a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor and system solutions for aerospace and defense, communications, data center and industrial markets.
The Company's primary reason for this acquisition was to expand the Company's range of solutions, products and capabilities by extending its served available market.
The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, with the Company identified as the acquirer, and the operating results of Microsemi have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of the closing date of the acquisition.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the aggregate amount of consideration paid by the Company was allocated to Microsemi's net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of May 29, 2018.
The excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets was recorded to goodwill.
The factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill were based upon the Company's conclusion that there are strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized from the acquisition.
None of the goodwill related to the Microsemi acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.
The Company retained independent third-party appraisers to assist management in its valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities.
The table below represents the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values, as well as the associated estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets (in millions).
Purchased intangible assets include core and developed technology, in-process research and development, customer-related intangibles, acquisition-date backlog and other intangible assets.
The estimated fair values of the core and developed technology and in-process research and development are being determined based on the present value of the expected cash flows to be generated by the respective existing technology or future technology.
In-process research and development is capitalized until such time as the related projects are completed or abandoned at which time the capitalized amounts will begin to be amortized or written off.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of Microsemi's contractual relationships and customer loyalty related to its distributor and end-customer relationships.
The fair values of the customer-related intangibles were determined using the distributor method, a form of the income approach based on distributor margin and expected attrition and revenue growth for Microsemi's existing customers as of the acquisition date.
Customer relationships are being amortized in a manner based on the estimated cash flows associated with the existing customers and anticipated retention rates.
Backlog relates to the value of orders not yet shipped by Microsemi at the acquisition date, and the fair values are being determined based on the estimated profit associated with those orders.
Backlog related assets have a one year useful life and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over that period.
Amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is not deductible for tax purposes.
Thus, approximately $856.7 million was established as a net deferred tax liability for the future amortization of the intangible assets.
The Company's reportable segments are semiconductor products and technology licensing.
The Company does not allocate operating expenses, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense, or provision for or benefit from income taxes to these segments for internal reporting purposes, as the Company does not believe that allocating these expenses is beneficial in evaluating segment performance.
Additionally, the Company does not allocate assets to segments for internal reporting purposes as it does not manage its segments by such metrics.
The product lines listed above are included entirely in the Company's semiconductor product segment with the exception of the licensing, memory and other product line, which includes products from both the semiconductor product and technology licensing segments.
Distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them.
Distributors generally have a distributor agreement with the Company to govern the terms of the relationship.
Direct customers are non-distributor customers, which generally do not have a master sales agreement with the Company.
The Company's direct customers primarily consist of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and, to a lesser extent, contract manufacturers.
All of the contract types listed in the table above are included in the Company's semiconductor product segment with the exception of licensees, which is the technology licensing segment.
Substantially all of the Company's net sales are recognized from contracts with customers.
For contracts related to the purchase of semiconductor products, the Company satisfies its performance obligation when control of the ordered product transfers to the customer.
The timing of the transfer of control depends on the agreed upon shipping terms with the customer, but generally occurs upon shipment, which is when physical possession of the product has been transferred and legal title of the product transfers to the customer.
Payment is generally collected after the Company satisfies its performance obligation, therefore contract liabilities are uncommon.
Also, the Company usually does not record contract assets because the Company has an unconditional right to payment upon satisfaction of the performance obligation, and therefore, a receivable is more commonly recorded than a contract asset.
Refer to Note 10 for the opening and closing balances of the Company's receivables.
As contracts with customers generally have an expected duration of one year or less, the balance of open performance obligations as of period end that will be recognized as revenue subsequent to June 30, 2020 is immaterial.
Generally, there is only a single performance obligation in the Company's contracts with customers for semiconductor products; as such, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation and allocation of the transaction price to individual performance obligations is not necessary.
The consideration received from customers is fixed, with the exception of consideration from certain distributors.
Certain of the Company's distributors are granted price concessions and return rights, which result in variable consideration.
The amount of revenue recognized for sales to these certain distributors is adjusted for estimates of the price concessions and return rights that are expected to be claimed.
These estimates are based on the recent history of price concessions and stock rotations.
For contracts related to the sale of the Company's intellectual property, the Company satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenue when control of the intellectual property transfers to the customer.
For contracts related to the licensing of the Company's technology, the Company satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenue as usage of the license occurs.
Payment is collected after the Company satisfies its performance obligation, and therefore no contract liabilities are recorded.
Refer to Note 10 for the opening and closing balances of the Company's receivables.
The Company continuously evaluates its existing operations in an attempt to identify and realize cost savings opportunities and operational efficiencies.
This same approach is applied to businesses that are acquired by the Company and often the operating models of acquired companies are not as efficient as the Company's operating model which enables the Company to realize significant savings and efficiencies.
As a result, following an acquisition, the Company will from time to time incur restructuring expenses; however, the Company is often not able to estimate the timing or amount of such costs in advance of the period in which they occur.
The primary reason for this is that the Company regularly reviews and evaluates each position, contract and expense against the Company's strategic objectives, long-term operating targets and other operational priorities.
Decisions related to restructuring activities are made on a "rolling basis" during the course of the integration of an acquisition whereby department managers, executives and other leaders work together to evaluate each of these expenses and make recommendations.
As a result of this approach, at the time of an acquisition, the Company is not able to estimate the future amount of expected employee separation or exit costs that it will incur in connection with its restructuring activities.
The Company's restructuring expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were primarily related to the Company's most recent business acquisitions, and resulted from workforce, property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations.
These expenses were for employee separation costs and intangible asset impairment charges.
The impairment charges in fiscal 2019 were primarily recognized as a result of writing off intangible assets purchased from Microsemi prior to the close of the acquisition and other intangible assets that were impaired as a result of changes in the combined product roadmaps after the acquisition that affected the use and life of the assets.
Additional costs will be incurred in the future as additional synergies or operational efficiencies are identified in connection with the Microsemi transaction and other previous acquisitions.
The Company is not able to estimate the amount of such future expenses at this time.
All of the Company's restructuring activities occurred in its semiconductor products segment.
The Company incurred $112.3 million in costs since the start of fiscal 2017 in connection with employee separation activities, of which $6.7 million and $45.1 million were incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company could incur future expenses as additional synergies or operational efficiencies are identified.
The Company is not able to estimate future expenses, if any, to be incurred in employee separation costs.
The Company has incurred $40.1 million in costs in connection with contract exit activities since the start of fiscal 2017 which includes $7.0 million of income incurred for three months ended June 30, 2018.
The $7.0 million income was attributable to changes in timing and amount of cash flows related to a vacated lease liability.
There were no contract exit activities during the three months ended June 30, 2019.
The liability for restructuring and other exit costs of $32.1 million is included in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2019.
The Company's investments are intended to establish a high-quality portfolio that preserves principal, meets liquidity needs, avoids inappropriate concentrations, and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to the Company's investment guidelines and market conditions.
As of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had short-term investments of $3.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, consisting of marketable equity securities.
The Company had no available-for-sale debt securities at June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019.
There were no sales of available-for-sale debt securities during the three months ended June 30, 2019.
The Company sold available-for-sale debt securities for proceeds of $1.38 billion during the year ended March 31, 2019 to help finance its acquisition of Microsemi.
The Company recognized losses of $5.6 million on available-for-sale debt securities during the year ended March 31, 2019.
The Company determines the cost of available-for-sale debt securities sold on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis at the individual security level for sales from multiple lots.
For sales of marketable equity securities, the Company uses an average cost basis at the individual security level.
Gains and losses recognized in earnings are credited or charged to other income (loss), net on the condensed consolidated statements of income.
Level 3-Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
securities that are traded in less active markets, the Company classifies its marketable debt instruments as Level 2.
When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, the Company prices its marketable debt instruments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.
Non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers.
These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical or similar securities; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and, to a lesser degree, unobservable market inputs.
The Company corroborates non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists.
The discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings.
There were no transfers between Level 1 or Level 2 during the three months ended June 30, 2019 or fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
There were no assets measured on a recurring basis during the three months ended June 30, 2019 or fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
The Company's non-marketable equity, cost method investments, certain acquired liabilities and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, assets held for sale and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
These assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, for example, when there is evidence of impairment.
The Company's non-marketable and cost method investments are monitored on a quarterly basis for impairment charges.
use unobservable inputs that require management's judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices.
There were no impairment charges recognized on these investments during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.
These investments are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
The fair value measurements related to the Company's non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, assets held for sale and property, plant and equipment are based on available market prices at the measurement date based on transactions of similar assets and third-party independent appraisals, less costs to sell where appropriate.
Management believes the carrying amount of the equity and cost-method investments materially approximated fair value at June 30, 2019 based upon unobservable inputs.
The fair values of the Company's line of credit borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and approximate carrying value excluding debt issuance costs.
Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of the Company's line of credit borrowings at June 30, 2019 approximated the carrying value and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in Note 8.
The carrying amount of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the amounts and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The Company measures the fair value of its senior and junior subordinated convertible debt and senior secured notes for disclosure purposes.
These fair values are based on observable market prices for this debt, which is traded in less active markets and are therefore classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's senior and junior subordinated convertible debt, senior secured notes, and term loan facility as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019 (in millions).
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method.
Inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable.
Depreciation expense attributed to property, plant and equipment was $46.2 million and $38.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease accounting standard using the modified retrospective approach.
The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance with the new standard, which among other things, allows the Company to carry forward historical lease classification.
The Company elected to apply the short-term measurement and recognition exemption in which right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are not recognized for short-term leases.
Adoption of this standard resulted in recording of net operating lease ROU assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities of $124.6 million and $137.3 million, respectively.
The standard did not materially affect the condensed consolidated statements of income and had no impact on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Operating lease ROU assets also include any initial direct costs and prepayments less lease incentives.
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.
Operating lease arrangements are comprised primarily of real estate and equipment agreements for which the right-of-use assets are included in other assets and the corresponding lease liabilities, depending on their maturity, are included in accrued liabilities or other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
There are certain immaterial finance leases recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company has elected to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
The Company recognized impairment charges of $0.5 million and $2.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
At March 31, 2019, the Company applied a qualitative goodwill impairment test to its two reporting units, concluding it was not more likely than not that goodwill was impaired.
Through June 30, 2019, the Company has never recorded an impairment charge against its goodwill balance.
The Company’s effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were not meaningful due to the amount of pre-tax income and the tax benefits recorded during the period.
The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2019 is lower compared to the prior year primarily due to discrete benefits related to releases of uncertain tax positions due to lapses of statutes of limitations.
In addition, the Company has numerous tax holidays it receives related to its Thailand manufacturing operations based on its investment in property, plant and equipment in Thailand, as well as Microsemi’s tax holiday in Malaysia that effectively reduces its income tax rate in that jurisdiction.
The Company's tax holiday periods in Thailand expire at various times in the future, however, the Company actively seeks to obtain new tax holidays.
The Company does not expect the future expiration of any of its tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on its effective tax rate.
Microsemi’s tax holiday in Malaysia was granted in 2009 and is effective through December 2019, subject to continued compliance with the tax holiday’s requirements.
If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized.
If this threshold is met, the Company recognizes the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
The Company believes it maintains appropriate reserves to offset any potential income tax liabilities that may arise upon final resolution of matters for open tax years.
If such reserve amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves could result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary.
If such amounts prove to be less than an ultimate assessment, a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined.
Summary of Conversion Features - Each series of Convertible Debt is convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company's election, at specified Conversion Rates (see table below), adjusted for certain events including the declaration of cash dividends.
Except during the three-month period immediately preceding the maturity date of the applicable series of Convertible Debt, each series of Convertible Debt is convertible only upon the occurrence of (1) such time as the closing price of the Company's common stock exceeds the Conversion Price (see table below) by 130% for 20 days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter or (2) during the 5 business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day or (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events specified in the indenture of such series of Convertible Debt.
In addition, for each series, if at the time of conversion the applicable price of the Company's common stock exceeds the applicable Conversion Price at such time, the applicable Conversion Rate will be increased by up to an additional maximum incremental shares rate, as determined pursuant to a formula specified in the indenture for the applicable series of Convertible Debt, and as adjusted for cash dividends paid since the issuance of such series of Convertible Debt.
However, in no event will the applicable Conversion Rate exceed the applicable Maximum Conversion Rate specified in the indenture for the applicable series of Convertible Debt (see table below).
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the applicable indenture of such series of Convertible Debt, holders of such series may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Convertible Debt for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
The remaining period over which the unamortized debt discount will be recognized as non-cash interest expense is 7.6 years, 5.6 years, and 17.6 years for the 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, 2015 Senior Convertible Debt and 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, respectively.
In May 2018, the Company issued $1.00 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.922% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”) and $1.00 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.333% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”, and together with the 2021 Notes, the "Senior Secured Notes") to qualified institutional buyers in a Rule 144A offering.
In connection with the issuance of these instruments, the Company incurred issuance costs of $24.4 million and recorded a debt discount of $10.5 million for fees deducted from the proceeds, which will both be amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the debt.
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes prior to June 1, 2021 at a price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes redeemed or (b) the sum of the present value of all remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (discounted in accordance with the indenture for the 2021 Notes) that would have been due on the redeemed 2021 Notes, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
If the Company experiences a specified change of control triggering event, the Company must offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
The Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured, on a pari passu first lien basis with the Senior Credit Facilities, by substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets (other than certain excluded assets) of the Company and the guarantors that secure obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, in each case subject to certain thresholds, exceptions and permitted liens, as set forth in the indenture for the Senior Secured Notes and the Security Agreement, dated May 29, 2018, by and among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and the Collateral Agent (the "Security Agreement").
In May 2018, the Company amended and restated its credit agreement to, among other things, increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility thereunder to $3.84 billion from $3.12 billion at March 31, 2018.
In connection with the amendment and restatement of the Credit Agreement, the Company incurred issuance costs of $13.6 million which will be amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the debt.
In the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company terminated the commitments for the 2020 Revolving Loans which decreased the capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility to $3.60 billion.
The Credit Agreement consists of approximately $3.60 billion of revolving loan commitments that terminate on May 18, 2023 (the "2023 Maturity Date").
The $244.3 million of revolving loan commitments (the "2020 Revolving Loans") that would terminate on February 4, 2020 were canceled in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
The Revolving Loans bear interest, at the Company’s option, at the base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 1.00% or an adjusted LIBOR rate (based on one, two, three or six-month interest periods) plus a spread of 1.00% to 2.00%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the consolidated senior leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period.
The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the Credit Agreement.
To secure the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement and the subsidiary guarantors’ obligations under the guarantees, the Company and each of the subsidiary guarantors has granted a security interest in substantially all its assets subject to certain exceptions and limitations.
In connection with such borrowings, the Company incurred issuance costs of $34.7 million which will be
The Credit Agreement provides for quarterly amortization payments of the Term Loans on the last business day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the last business day of the first full fiscal quarter to occur after the Microsemi acquisition effective date, equal to 0.25% of the aggregate original principal amount of the Term Loans.
In addition, the Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayments of the Term Loans from the incurrence of debt not otherwise permitted to be incurred under the Credit Agreement, certain asset sales and certain excess cash flow.
Mandatory prepayments with excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) are required to be made beginning with the Company’s fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 in an amount equal to 50%, 25% or 0% of the excess cash flow for such fiscal year, depending on the Company’s senior leverage ratio.
The Company may prepay the Term Loans at any time without premium or penalty.
The Company voluntarily prepaid $188.0 million of principal under the Term Loan Facility for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which resulted in a loss on settlement of debt of approximately $1.9 million consisting of unamortized financing fees.
During fiscal 2019, the Company voluntarily prepaid $1.09 billion of principal under the Term Loan Facility of which $500.0 million was from funds borrowed under its Revolving Credit Facility, and such transactions resulted in a loss on settlement of debt of approximately $11.5 million consisting of unamortized financing fees.
Principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable on the 2023 Maturity Date in the case of revolving loans under the Credit Agreement and May 29, 2025 in the case of the Term Loans.
The Company may prepay the loans and terminate the commitments, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions including minimum amounts in the case of commitment reductions and reimbursement of certain costs in the case of prepayments of LIBOR loans.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock, enter into restrictive agreements and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type.
The Company is also required to maintain compliance with a senior leverage ratio, a total leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, all measured quarterly and calculated on a consolidated basis.
At June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants.
The financial covenants include limits on the Company's consolidated total leverage ratio and senior leverage ratio.
The total leverage ratio is calculated as Consolidated Total Indebtedness, excluding the Junior Convertible Debt up to a $700 million maximum, to Consolidated EBIDTA for a period of four consecutive quarters.
The Credit Agreement also requires that the Senior Leverage Ratio, measured quarterly, not exceed (a) 4.75 to 1.00 for any such period ended from (and including) the Microsemi Acquisition Closing Date to (but excluding) the first anniversary of the Microsemi Acquisition Closing Date, (b) 4.25 to 1.00 for any such period ended on or after the first anniversary of the Microsemi Acquisition Closing Date to (but excluding) the second anniversary of the Microsemi Acquisition Closing Date and (c) 3.75 to 1.00 for any such period ended on or after the second anniversary of the Microsemi Acquisition Closing Date.
The Company is also required to comply with a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of at least 3.25 to 1.00 for any period ended on or after the Microsemi Acquisition Closing Date, measured quarterly.
The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default that include, among other things, non-payment defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross default to material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, material judgment defaults, ERISA defaults and a change of control default.
The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement.
The Company has defined benefit pension plans that cover certain French and German employees.
Most of these defined pension plans, which were acquired in the Atmel and Microsemi acquisitions, are unfunded.
Plan benefits are provided in accordance with local statutory requirements.
Benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation levels.
Pension liabilities and charges are based upon various assumptions, updated annually, including discount rates, future salary increases, employee turnover, and mortality rates.
Interest costs and amortization of actuarial losses are recorded in the other income, net line item in the condensed consolidated statements of income.
The Company's net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2020 is expected to be approximately $3.3 million.
Cash funding for benefits paid was $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In the ordinary course of the Company's business, it is exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts, product liability, customer claims, governmental investigations and other matters.
Additionally, the Company is involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant.
Consequently, the Company could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions.
The Company also periodically receives notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights, or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs.
Litigation, governmental investigations and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon, and the Company is, from time to time, subject to such litigation, governmental investigations and disputes.
As a result, no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation, governmental investigations or disputes in the future.
Federal Derivative Litigation.
On December 17, 2018, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, captioned Kistenmacher v. Sanghi, et al., Case No.
The complaint generally alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, making or causing the Company to make false and misleading statements and omissions regarding the Microsemi acquisition, the Company’s business, operations, and prospects, and a purported failure to maintain internal controls.
The complaint further alleges that certain defendants engaged in insider trading.
The complaint asserts causes of action for alleged violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duties, and unjust enrichment and seeks unspecified monetary damages, corporate governance reforms, restitution, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
Peterson, et al.
On October 9, 2018, four former officers of Microsemi Corporation filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California in Orange County against the Company, Steve Sanghi, Eric Bjornholt, Ganesh Moorthy and Mitch Little asserting claims for slander per se, libel per se, trade libel, and violations of California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 ("UCL").
Among other things, the plaintiffs in this matter allege that statements the Microchip executives made about excess shipments of products by Microsemi into the distribution channel were defamatory and that Microchip executives, including Mr. Sanghi, made false statements about Microsemi's shipments of products into the distribution channel, about certain Microsemi business practices and about the relative strength of the financial results of Microchip and Microsemi for the June quarter.
Defendants moved to dismiss, and, following the Court's ruling, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that dropped the trade libel and UCL claims.
The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages (ranging from an alleged $10 million to $100 million), as well as punitive damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees and costs.
Discovery has begun, and the Court has set a Final Pretrial Conference date of May 22, 2020.
The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating matters relating to the Company's acquisition of Microsemi.
The Company believes that the investigations relate to distribution channel issues and business practices at Microsemi and the allegations made by the plaintiffs in the Peterson v. Sanghi lawsuit described above.
On December 29, 2016, Continental Automotive GmbH ("Continental") filed a Request for Arbitration with the ICC, naming as respondents the Company's subsidiaries Atmel Corporation, Atmel SARL, Atmel Global Sales Ltd., and Atmel Automotive GmbH (collectively, "Atmel").
The Request alleges that a quality issue affecting Continental airbag control units in certain recalled vehicles stems from allegedly defective Atmel application specific integrated circuits ("ASICs").
Continental seeks to recover from Atmel all related costs and damages incurred as a result of the vehicle manufacturers’ airbag control unit-related recalls, currently alleged to be $210 million.
The Company's Atmel subsidiaries intend to defend this action vigorously.
On March 4, 2014, LFR and Jean-Yves Guerrini, individually and on behalf of a putative class of LFR employees, filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "District Court") against the Company's Atmel subsidiary, French subsidiary, Atmel Rousset S.A.S.
The case purports to relate to Atmel Rousset's June 2010 sale of its wafer manufacturing facility in Rousset, France to LF, and LFR's subsequent insolvency, and later liquidation, more than three years later.
The District Court dismissed the case on August 21, 2015, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal on June 27, 2016.
On May 19, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the June 27, 2016 order dismissing the case.
Individual Labor Actions by former LFR Employees.
In June 2010, Atmel Rousset sold its wafer manufacturing business in Rousset, France to LFoundry GmbH ("LF"), the German parent of LFoundry Rousset ("LFR").
LFR then leased the Atmel Rousset facility to conduct the manufacture of wafers.
More than three years later, LFR became insolvent and later liquidated.
In the wake of LFR's insolvency and liquidation, over 500 former employees of LFR have filed individual labor actions against Atmel Rousset in a French labor court.
The Company's Atmel Rousset subsidiary believes that each of these actions is entirely devoid of merit, and, further, that any assertion by any of the Claimants of a co-employment relationship with the Atmel Rousset subsidiary is based substantially on the same specious arguments that the Paris Commercial Court summarily rejected in 2014 in related proceedings.
The Company's Atmel Rousset subsidiary therefore intends to defend vigorously against each of these claims.
Additionally, complaints have been filed in a regional court in France on behalf of the same group of employees against Microchip Technology Rousset, Atmel Switzerland Sarl, Atmel Corporation and Microchip Technology Incorporated alleging that the sale of the Atmel Rousset production unit to LF was fraudulent and should be voided.
Furthermore, new claims have been filed in a regional court in France on behalf of a subset of this same group of employees against Microchip Technology Incorporated and Atmel Corporation.
These claims are specious and the defendant entities therefore intend to defend vigorously against these claims.
The Company accrues for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable.
As of the end of each applicable reporting period, the Company reviews each of its matters and, where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred, the Company accrues for all probable and reasonably estimable losses.
Where the Company can reasonably estimate a range of losses it may incur regarding such a matter, the Company records an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes its best estimate.
If the Company can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, the Company uses the amount that is the low end of such range.
As of June 30, 2019, the Company's estimate of the aggregate potential liability that is possible but not probable is approximately $100 million in excess of amounts accrued.
The terms of these indemnification provisions approximate the terms of the outgoing technology license agreements, which are typically perpetual unless terminated by either party for breach.
The possible amount of future payments the Company could be required to make based on agreements that specify indemnification limits, if such indemnifications were required on all of these agreements, is approximately $165 million.
There are some licensing agreements in place that do not specify indemnification limits.
As reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the Company learned of an ongoing compromise of its computer networks by what is believed to be sophisticated hackers.
The Company has taken steps to identify malicious activity on its network including a compromise of its network and, in May 2019, the Company began implementing a containment plan.
The Company is continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of the containment plan and the amount and content of the information that was compromised and to implement additional remedial actions.
However, until the Company completes its evaluation of the amount and type of data that was compromised, there can be no assurance as to what the impact of this IT system compromise will be.
The Company has international operations and is thus subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations.
Approximately 99% of the Company's sales are U.S. Dollar denominated.
However, a significant amount of the Company's expenses and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies and subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations.
To help manage the risk of changes in foreign currency rates, the Company periodically enters into derivative contracts comprised of foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its asset and liability foreign currency exposure and a portion of its foreign currency operating expenses.
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations after the effects of hedging activity resulted in net gains of $2.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to a net loss of $4.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had a foreign currency forward contract outstanding with a notional amount of $220.6 million to economically hedge certain balance sheet exposures related to the Malaysian ringgit.
The fair value of this contract was immaterial as of June 30, 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, the Company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.
The Company recognized an immaterial amount of net losses and gains on foreign currency forward contracts in each of the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are credited or charged to other income (loss), net.
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that it consumes, particularly electricity and natural gas.
The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, on an index basis.
The Company seeks, or may seek, to partially mitigate these exposures through fixed-price contracts.
These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the "normal purchases or normal sales" exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.
In connection with its acquisition of Microsemi on May 29, 2018, the Company assumed certain restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights (SARs), and stock options granted by Microsemi.
The assumed awards were measured at the acquisition date based on the estimated fair value, which was a total of $175.4 million.
A portion of that fair value, $53.9 million, which represented the pre-acquisition vested service provided by employees to Microsemi, was included in the total consideration transferred as part of the acquisition.
As of the acquisition date, the remaining portion of the fair value of those awards was $121.5 million, representing post-acquisition share-based compensation expense that will be recognized as these employees provide service over the remaining vesting periods.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized $21.9 million of share-based compensation expense in connection with the acquisition of Microsemi, of which $0.4 million was capitalized into inventory and $15.9 million was due to the accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards upon termination of certain Microsemi employees.
Potentially dilutive common shares from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs.
Weighted average common shares exclude the effect of option shares which are not dilutive.
There were no anti-dilutive option shares for each of the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
In January 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase to the existing share repurchase program to 15.0 million shares of common stock.
There were no repurchases of common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2019.
There is no expiration date associated with this repurchase program.
As of June 30, 2019, approximately 15.2 million shares remained as treasury shares with the balance of the shares being used to fund share issuance requirements under the Company's equity incentive plans.
A quarterly cash dividend of $0.3655 per share was paid on June 4, 2019 in the aggregate amount of $87.1 million.
A quarterly cash dividend of $0.3660 per share was declared on August 6, 2019 and will be paid on September 4, 2019 to stockholders of record as of August 21, 2019.
The Company expects the September 2019 payment of its quarterly cash dividend to be approximately $87.3 million.
Refer to Note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings.
•property damage or other losses, whether or not covered by insurance.
On May 29, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Microsemi, which was our largest and most complex acquisition ever.
In addition, in April 2016, we completed our acquisition of Atmel; and in August 2015, we completed our acquisition of Micrel.
We may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees.
We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, procedures and policies and we may be unable to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration.
There may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems.
We may have difficulty in developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company, or in growing the business at the rate we anticipate.
Following an acquisition, we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition.
We may suffer loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies.
We have been and may in the future be subject to claims from terminated employees, shareholders of Microchip or the acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction.
In particular, in connection with our Microsemi and Atmel acquisitions, we became involved with third-party claims, litigation, governmental investigations and disputes related to such businesses and transactions.
See Note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding pending litigation.
Acquisitions may also result in charges (such as acquisition-related expenses, write-offs, restructuring charges, or future impairment of goodwill), contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional share-based compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results.
To fund our acquisition of Microsemi, we used a significant portion of our cash balances and incurred approximately $8.10 billion of additional debt.
Further, if we decide to divest assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner.
Even following a divestiture, we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers, vendors, landlords or other third parties.
We may also have continuing obligations for pre-existing liabilities related to the assets or businesses.
These transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction, to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions.
As of June 30, 2019, the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $11.40 billion.
In connection with our acquisition of Microsemi, we incurred debt consisting of $3.10 billion under our revolving line of credit, $3.00 billion under our term loan facility, and $2.00 billion in senior secured notes.
At June 30, 2019, we had $3.20 billion in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit which provides up to $3.60 billion of revolving loan commitments that terminate in 2023.
At June 30, 2019, we had $1.72 billion of outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility.
In February 2017, we issued $2.65 billion of aggregate principal value of senior and junior convertible debt.
As a result of such transactions, we have a substantially greater amount of debt than we had maintained in the past.
We may need or desire to refinance our convertible debt, senior debt, term loan debt or any other future indebtedness and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
Servicing our current debt will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to fund future payments.
Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including our outstanding convertible debt and debt incurred to finance our acquisition of Microsemi, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors.
If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.
Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.
Turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times.
Because turns orders are difficult to predict, varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales.
Our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards.
We generally have more than one source for these supplies, but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various materials and equipment that meet our standards.
The materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases.
Also, the application of trade restrictions or tariffs by the U.S. or other countries may adversely impact the industry supply chain.
For example, the U.S. government has recently increased tariffs on products that have China as their country of origin and which are imported into the U.S.
Likewise, the China government has increased tariffs on products that have the U.S. as their country of origin and which are imported into China.
We have taken steps to attempt to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business.
We may also incur increases in manufacturing costs in mitigating the impact of tariffs on our operations.
This could also impair sourcing flexibility.
We have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past, and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacement parts.
In particular, we have recently experienced longer lead times for equipment which we need for capacity expansion at certain of our manufacturing facilities.
An interruption of any materials or equipment sources, or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment, could harm our business.
Our customers may also be adversely affected by these same issues.
Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product.
The average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products have remained relatively constant, while average selling prices of our memory and non-proprietary analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products have declined over time.
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions.
However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.
We have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience in the future, varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory and non-proprietary analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products.
We are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us, and our licensees of our SuperFlash and other technologies also rely on foundries and other contractors.
Specifically, during the first three months of fiscal 2020, approximately 61% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to 57% of our net sales in fiscal 2019.
We also use several contractors located primarily in Asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products.
Specifically, during the first three months of fiscal 2020, approximately 55% of our assembly requirements and 46% of our test requirements were performed by third party contractors compared to approximately 62% of our assembly requirements and 51% of our test requirements during fiscal 2019.
Our reliance on third party contractors and foundries increased as a result of our acquisitions of Microsemi, Atmel, Micrel and other companies.
Our use of third parties somewhat reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business.
Certain of our SuperFlash and other technology licensees also rely on outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication services.
The manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits, particularly non-volatile, erasable CMOS memory and logic devices such as those that we produce, are complex processes.
These processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used, the performance of our wafer fabrication and assembly and test personnel and equipment, and other quality issues.
As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields.
This could include delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue or future orders, and customer-imposed penalties for our failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we operated at below normal capacity levels resulting in an unabsorbed capacity charge of $7.3 million.
In certain periods in fiscal 2019, we operated at below normal capacity levels resulting in as unabsorbed capacity charge of $19.0 million.
The semiconductor industry has also experienced significant economic downturns, characterized by diminished product demand and production over-capacity.
We have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products, that cannot be easily or quickly replaced, to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments.
Our business is dependent on distributors to service our end customers.
Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 50% of our net sales in the first three months of fiscal 2020 and approximately 51% of our net sales in fiscal 2019.
We do not have long-term agreements with our distributors, and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice.
Our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis.
•market acceptance of our customers' end products.
Because our products are complex, we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development.
In addition, our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance.
Interruptions in our IT systems, unauthorized access to our IT systems or improper handling of data, could adversely affect our business.
We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex IT systems and networks to operate our business.
Any significant disruption to our systems or networks, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations, sales and operating results.
Additionally, any failure to properly manage the collection, handling, transfer or disposal of personal data of employees and customers may result in regulatory penalties, enforcement actions, remediation obligations, litigation, fines and other sanctions.
From time to time, we have experienced verifiable attacks on our data, attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our IT systems.
For example, in fiscal 2019 we learned of an ongoing compromise of our computer networks by what is believed to be sophisticated hackers.
We engaged experienced legal counsel and a leading forensic investigatory firm with experience in such matters.
We have taken steps to identify malicious activity on our network including a compromise of our network and, in May 2019, we began implementing a containment plan.
We are continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of the containment plan and the amount and content of the information that was compromised and to implement additional remedial actions.
However, we are still evaluating the amount and type of data that was compromised and there can be no assurance as to what the impact of this IT system compromise will be.
As a result of the IT system compromise, our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, has concluded that our internal controls related to IT system access were not effective resulting in a material weakness in our internal controls.
Third-party service providers, such as wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors, distributors, credit card processors and other vendors have access to certain portions of our and our customers' sensitive data.
In the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold, security breaches and loss of data could result.
As discussed in Item 4 “Controls and Procedures” of our Form 10-K filed on May 30, 2019, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to accounting for income taxes and we also identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to IT system access.
We are in the process of remediating the material weaknesses, but our efforts may not be successful.
Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently.
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors.
In addition to the recently identified material weaknesses related to accounting for income taxes and to IT system access, we have from time to time identified significant deficiencies related to other matters.
Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices.
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
These accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the SEC.
New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future.
New accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is announced or effective.
Operations at any of our facilities, at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors, or at any of our significant vendors or customers may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control.
These reasons may include work stoppages, power loss, cyber attacks, computer network compromises, incidents of terrorism or security risk, political instability, public health issues, telecommunications, transportation or other infrastructure failure, radioactive contamination, fire, earthquake, floods, volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters.
While our facilities in Thailand have continued to operate normally, there can be no assurance that any future flooding in Thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations.
Our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks.
•market acceptance of our customers' end products.
We are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings, investigations or claims.
As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we receive notifications from third parties from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against us, our direct or indirect customers or our licensees.
These legal proceedings and claims, even if meritless, could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources.
•a requirement to pay damages or penalties.
Further, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law.
Further, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive, aerospace, defense, safety, security, and medical, where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons.
We may be subject to claims if our products, or the integration of our products, cause system failures.
We will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products.
The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive, and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications.
We regularly review the financial performance of our licensees, customers, distributors and suppliers.
Sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales.
During the first three months of fiscal 2020, approximately 79% of our net sales were made to foreign customers, including 21% in China and 14% in Taiwan.
A strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy.
The U.S. government has increased tariffs on products that have China as their country of origin and which are imported into the U.S.
Likewise, the China government has increased tariffs on products that have the U.S. as their country of origin and which are imported into China.
We have taken steps to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business.
Although these increases in tariffs did not result in significant increases to the operating costs of our business, they did, however, adversely impact demand for our products during fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Additionally, the Japan-South Korea trade dispute could put pressure on our Japanese and South Korean customers.
These pressures may result in various negative effects such as a decrease in the supply of raw materials or components needed to complete products, an increase in costs of raw materials or components, the inability to receive licenses to sell their products in the other country, boycotts, or similar actions.
We purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers.
In addition, we own product assembly and testing facilities near Bangkok, Thailand, which has experienced periods of political instability in the past.
A large portion of our finished goods inventory is maintained in Thailand.
As part of our Atmel acquisition, we acquired a test facility in Calamba, Philippines.
We use various foundries and other foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements.
•difficulties in collecting receivables and longer payment cycles.
Our contractual relationships with our customers expose us to risks and liabilities.
When we do enter into customer contracts, the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer.
Even though we had over 122,000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 12% of our total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and six of our top ten direct customers are contract manufacturers that perform manufacturing services for many customers, cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits.
We have contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale.
If we are unable to supply the customer as required under the contract, the customer may incur additional production costs, lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule, or quality-related issues.
While we try to minimize the number of contracts which contain such provisions, manage the risks underlying such liabilities, and set caps on our liability exposure, sometimes we are not able to do so.
Further, where we do not have negotiated contracts with our customers, the terms of our customer's orders may govern the transaction and contain terms that are not favorable to us.
Future sales to U.S. government agencies or customers are also subject to uncertain government appropriations and national defense policies and priorities, including the constraints of the budgetary process, changes in the timing and potential spending priorities and the impact of any past or future government shutdowns, contract terminations or renegotiations, or future sequestrations.
Such sales are also subject to uncertainties related to monetary, regulatory, tax and trade policies implemented by current or future administrations or by the U.S. Congress.
In the past, Microsemi has experienced delays and reductions in appropriations on programs that included its products.
Further delays, reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts, including those caused by any past or future shutdown of the U.S. federal government, could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
If the U.S. government fails to complete its annual budget process or to provide for a continuing resolution to fund government operations, another federal government shutdown may occur, during which time we may experience further delays and reductions in appropriations or reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
While we generally function as a subcontractor in these type of transactions, further changes in U.S. government procurement regulations and practices, particularly surrounding initiatives to reduce costs, may adversely impact the contracting environment and our operating results.
The U.S. government and its contractors may terminate their contracts with Microsemi or us at any time.
For example, in 2014, Microsemi had a $75 million contract terminated for convenience by the U.S. government.
Our business related to U.S. governmental agencies or customers not only requires us to comply with the contract terms, but also with applicable governmental regulations, particularly for our facilities, systems and personnel that service such customers.
Maintaining compliance with these regulations, including any audit requirements, requires that we devote significant resources to such matters in terms of training, personnel, information technology and facilities.
Regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into or from which we ship our products could levy fines, restrict or delay our ability to export or transfer products, or increase costs associated with the manufacture or transfer of products.
In addition to local jurisdictions' trade regulations, our U.S.-manufactured products or products based on U.S. technology are subject to U.S. laws and regulations governing international trade, including, but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Export Administration Regulations, International Traffic in Arms Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and denied entities administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
A determination by the U.S. or foreign government that we have failed to comply with trade or export regulations or anti-bribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges, fines, civil or criminal penalties, and seizure of products.
Further, a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to transfer product to previously permitted countries, customers, distributors or other third parties.
For example, in fiscal 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department banned U.S. companies from selling products or transferring technology to ZTE, a Chinese company, and certain of its subsidiaries.
In 2018, there was a federal government shutdown from January 20, 2018 to January 23, 2018 and a second shutdown from December 22, 2018 through January 25, 2019.
Due to the U.S. federal government shutdown, the agency that approves these export licenses was temporarily closed.
the following quarter depending on the ability of the governmental agency to expedite processing of licenses delayed during the shutdown.
Trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalated in 2018 and 2019, including the U.S. increasing tariffs on Chinese origin goods, and China increasing tariffs on U.S. goods.
Higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been recently announced or threatened by the U.S. and Chinese administrations.
We have taken steps to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business.
Although these increases in tariffs did not result in significant increases to the operating costs of our business, they did, however, adversely impact demand for our products during fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Additionally, the Japan-South Korea trade dispute could put pressures on our Japanese and South Korean customers, and the ongoing uncertainty regarding Brexit and its implications could also result in lower demand for our products.
We must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful, and competition for qualified personnel can be intense.
Our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management, engineering, manufacturing and other personnel.
The competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense.
We may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require.
The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business.
The loss of, or any inability to attract personnel, even if not key personnel, if experienced in sufficient numbers could harm our business.
We have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team.
We use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures.
In particular, in periods when a foreign currency significantly declines in value in relation to the U.S. dollar, customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products.
In periods when the U.S. dollar is significantly declining in relation to the British pound, Euro, Thai baht, Taiwan dollar and Malaysian ringgit, the operational costs in our European and Thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected.
We have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk; however, we self-insure for some potentially significant risks and obligations.
In these circumstances, we believe that it is more cost effective for us to self-insure certain risks than to pay the high premium costs.
We are subject to stringent environmental and other regulations, which may force us to incur significant expenses.
We must comply with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes.
Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines, suspension of production, cessation of operations or future liabilities.
Such environmental regulations have required us in the past, and could require us in the future, to buy costly equipment or to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations.
Our failure to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could impact the health of our employees and others and could impact our ability to operate.
There is a continuing expansion in environmental laws with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances and substances of high concern in electronic products and shipping materials.
These and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture, sell and ship our products.
In addition, the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories, the recycling of electronic products, and the reduction in the quantity and the recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly.
We may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations or customer requirements.
We expect these risks and trends to continue.
In addition, we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of substances of high concern in our products, energy efficiency measures, and supplier practices associated with sourcing and manufacturing.
These requirements may increase our own costs, as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain.
Some of our customers and potential customers are requiring that we implement operating practices that are more stringent than what is required by applicable laws with respect to workplace and labor requirements, the type of materials we use in our products, environmental matters or other items.
To comply with such requirements, we may have to pass these same operating practices on to our suppliers.
Our suppliers may refuse to implement these operating practices, or may charge us more for complying with them.
Developing, administering, monitoring and auditing these customer-requested practices at our own sites and those in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require that we hire more personnel.
Customer demands and regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, in August 2012, the SEC released investigation, disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of "conflict" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and which are necessary to the functionality or production of products.
We filed a report on Form SD with the SEC regarding such matters on May 31, 2019.
Other countries are considering similar regulations.
We have incurred, and expect in the future to incur, additional costs associated with complying with these new disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products.
If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold.
Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including but not limited to changes to our corporate operating structure, intercompany arrangements and tax planning strategies.
Currently, a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside of the U.S.
Some or all of the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debentures to decline or fluctuate substantially.
Anti-takeover defenses in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts, which could also reduce the market price of our common stock.
•advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.
The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us.
As a result of our acquisition activity, our goodwill and intangible assets have increased significantly in recent years and we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or intangible assets.
When we acquire a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.
The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired.
As of June 30, 2019, we had goodwill of $6.66 billion and net intangible assets of $6.43 billion.
In connection with the completion of our acquisition of Microsemi in May 2018, our balance of goodwill and intangible assets increased significantly.
We review our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets is more likely than not impaired.
No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019.
In the three months ended June 30, 2019, we recognized $0.5 million of intangible asset impairment charges.
In fiscal 2019, we recognized $3.1 million of intangible asset impairment charges.
Our foreign pension plans are unfunded, and any requirement to fund these plans in the future could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital.
In connection with our acquisitions of Microsemi and Atmel, we assumed defined benefit pension plans that cover certain of our French and German employees.
Benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation levels.
The projected benefit obligation totaled $73.9 million at June 30, 2019.
Most of these plans are unfunded in compliance with local statutory regulations, and we have no immediate intention of funding these plans.
Benefits are paid when amounts become due, commencing when participants retire.
We expect to pay approximately $1.3 million in fiscal 2020 for benefits earned.
From time to time we receive grants from governments, agencies and research organizations.
From time to time, we receive economic incentive grants and allowances from European governments, agencies and research organizations targeted at increasing employment at specific locations.
The subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive, headcount, capital and research and development expenditure and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain grant benefits, and these programs can be subjected to periodic review by the relevant governments.
Noncompliance by us with the conditions of the grants could result in our forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date.
Conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.
The conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures.
Upon conversion, we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash, shares of common stock or any combination, at our option.
If upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures, we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock.
Upon conversion, we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash.
If the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture, we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount (i.e., the conversion spread).
There would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash.
The conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share.
Climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct business.
Climate change regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions, change our manufacturing processes, obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions, fund offset projects or undertake other costly activities.
These regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment.
New permits may be required for our current operations, or expansions thereof.
Failure to timely receive permits could result in fines, suspension of production, or cessation of operations at one or more facilities.
In addition, restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs, and utility companies passing down carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards.
The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
Certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions, such as Arizona, Thailand, and the Philippines.
Some environmental experts predict that these regions may become vulnerable to storms, severe floods and droughts due to climate change.
While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can interrupt our business, we cannot be certain that our plans will protect us from all such disasters or events.
