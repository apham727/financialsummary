We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, including to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report, except to the extent required by law.
The fiscal year ending November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018) is a 53-week year and the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017) was a 52-week year.
Therefore, the first six months of fiscal 2018 included an additional week of operations as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.
On March 10, 2017 (Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation (Linear), a designer, manufacturer and marketer of high performance analog integrated circuits.
The acquisition of Linear is referred to as the Acquisition.
The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the financial results of Linear prospectively from the Acquisition Date.
See Note 13, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.
The following tables summarize revenue by end market for the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017.
The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated.
As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time.
When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods.
Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.
Industrial - The Industrial end market included $224.7 million and $449.7 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, respectively, as compared to $79.6 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
Industrial end market revenue increased in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of the Acquisition and a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market.
Additionally, Industrial end market revenue increased in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of an additional week of operations in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.
Automotive - The Automotive end market included $81.9 million and $166.7 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, respectively, as compared to $31.2 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.

Automotive end market revenue increased in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of the Acquisition, a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market and an additional week of operations in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.
Consumer end market revenue decreased in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a decreased demand for products used in portable consumer applications, partially offset by an increase in revenue due to the Acquisition, which was not significant, and an additional week of operations in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.
Communications - The Communications end market included $82.1 million and $168.4 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, respectively, as compared to $30.6 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
Communications end market revenue increased in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of the Acquisition and a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market.
Additionally, Communications end market revenue increased in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of an additional week of operations in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.
In the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017, the predominant country comprising “Rest of North and South America” is Canada; the predominant countries comprising “Europe” are Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are South Korea and Taiwan.
On a regional basis, the United States and Rest of North and South America included $98.3 million and $196.2 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, respectively, as compared to $29.7 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
Additionally, the sales increase in the United States in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was a result of an additional week of operations in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.
Europe included $92.1 million and $179.5 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, respectively, as compared to $41.5 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
The sales increase in Europe in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of the Acquisition and an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market partially offset by a decrease in demand for our products sold into the Automotive end market.
Additionally, the sales increase in Europe in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was a result of an additional week of operations in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.
Japan included $69.2 million and $141.3 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, respectively, as compared to no revenue, as a result of the deferral of revenue related to sales to distributors, in the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
The sales increase in Japan in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of the Acquisition and an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market.
China included $84.5 million and $173.4 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, respectively, as compared to $44.6 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
The Rest of Asia included $61.3 million and $125.4 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, respectively, as compared to $31.7 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.
The sales increase in China and the Rest of Asia in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of the Acquisition and a broad-based increase in demand for our products sold into all end markets.
Additionally, the sales increase in China and the Rest of Asia in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was a result of an additional week of operations in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.
Gross margin percentage increased by 1,250 basis points and 780 basis points in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, primarily because the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017 included cost of sales adjustments of $121.1 million related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value.
Amortization expenses increased in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, as a result of the purchase of intangible assets as part of the Acquisition.
As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years, which resulted in special charges of $16.1 million and $8.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, in an effort to reduce overall operating costs.
In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a special charge of $41.3 million related to an early retirement offer action, which we expect to result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation, and employee benefit savings of approximately $28.4 million once fully implemented.
In the first six months of fiscal 2018, we recorded special charges of $42.3 million as a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the Acquisition.
Over the next three to five years, we plan to close our Hillview wafer fabrication facility located in Milpitas, California and our Singapore test facility.
In addition, we are planning to transition testing operations currently handled in our Singapore facility to our facilities in Penang, Malaysia and the Philippines, in addition to our outsourced assembly and test partners.
The special charge recognized as a result of this action consists of severance and related benefit costs.
We expect that this action will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $60.0 million once fully implemented.
See Note 6, Special Charges, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.
Our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events.
The six-month period ended May 5, 2018 also includes a provisional estimate of $687.1 million for the discrete tax charge from the Tax Legislation’s one-time transition tax associated with our undistributed foreign earnings, which is comprised of the $751.1 million transitional tax liability less a deferred tax liability of $64.0 million that was recorded in prior years.
Additionally, we recorded discrete benefits for excess tax benefits from share-based payments of $8.2 and $18.2 million in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, respectively.
Our effective tax rate for the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017 included a tax benefit of $15.0 million for the release of a state tax credit valuation allowance as a result of the Acquisition.
The phasing in of the lower corporate income tax rate results in a blended federal tax rate of 23.4% for fiscal 2018, compared with the previous 35% rate.
Non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 75.7% of our total revenues for the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, compared to approximately 78.4% of our total revenues for the six-month period ended April 29, 2017.
The Company has a partial tax holiday in Singapore through August 2019 and a partial tax holiday in Malaysia through July 2025.
Net income increased in the three-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a $318.1 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in nonoperating expense and a $28.6 million increase in provision for income taxes.
Net income increased in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a $457.2 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $36.8 million increase in nonoperating expense and a $83.1 million increase in provision for income taxes.
At May 5, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was $806.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $388.9 million was held in the United States.
Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds.
We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.
On the Acquisition Date, we borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022.
We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.
At May 5, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $806.5 million.
The following changes contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2017.
Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net income adjusted for non-cash items, primarily resulting from changes to income taxes related to the Tax Legislation.
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.
The decrease in cash used for investing activities during the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of a decrease in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities.
The increase in accounts receivable in dollars was primarily the result of higher product shipments in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
Inventory in dollars remained flat, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels.
Current liabilities decreased to $1.4 billion at May 5, 2018 from $1.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the current portion of our debt.
As of May 5, 2018 and October 28, 2017, we had gross deferred revenue of $701.3 million and $589.5 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $135.6 million and $115.5 million, respectively.
Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in the first six months of fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of higher demand for products sold into the channel.
On June 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2013.
On December 14, 2015, we issued the 2025 Notes and the 2045 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2016.
$400.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2021 Notes), $550.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.125% Senior Unsecured Notes (December 2023 Notes), $900.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2026 Notes) and $250.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2036 Notes)
$300.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.85% Senior Unsecured Notes (2020 Notes) and $450.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.95% Senior Unsecured Notes (January 2021 Notes)
On March 12, 2018, we issued the 2020 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on March 12 and September 12 of each year, commencing September 12, 2018, and the January 2021 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on January 12 and July 12 of each year, commencing July 12, 2018.
On the Acquisition Date, we drew down on a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022.
We have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on July 10, 2020.
The agreement for such revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) provides that we may borrow up to $1.0 billion.
To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes.
The terms of the Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness.
In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0.
The debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.0 to 1.0 starting in May 2018.
As of May 5, 2018, we were compliant with these covenants.
Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004.
In the aggregate, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $6.2 billion of our common stock under the program.
Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program.
As of May 5, 2018, we had repurchased a total of approximately 147.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.4 billion under this program.
As of May 5, 2018, an additional $792.5 million remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program.
The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock.
In connection with the Acquisition, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program.
While we do not plan to resume share repurchases in the near term, we expect to continue repurchasing our common stock over the long-term.
We also, from time to time, repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units.
We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of $230.0 million to $270.0 million.
These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
On May 29, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.48 per outstanding share of common stock.
The dividend will be paid on June 19, 2018 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on June 8, 2018 and is expected to total approximately $178.0 million.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 445,000 sq.
ft. for a facility in Santa Clara, California.
As part of transitioning to the territorial tax system, the Tax Legislation includes a one-time transition tax that we intend to elect to pay over a period of eight years that begins in fiscal 2019 on an interest free basis.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, in an underwritten public offering, we issued the 2020 Notes and the January 2021 Notes.
There have not been any other material changes during the six-month period ended May 5, 2018 to the amounts presented in the table summarizing our contractual obligations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017.
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP).
The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The FASB has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations.
As amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
the implementation of the guidance, including a review of all revenue streams to identify any differences in the timing, measurement or presentation of revenue recognition.
We have reviewed our revenue streams and are nearing completion in assessing all potential impacts of the standard, including any impacts from recently issued amendments, and retrospectively adjusting financial information for prior fiscal years under the full retrospective transition method.
We have also made progress on our impact assessment of the Acquisition.
While we are still in the process of completing our evaluation of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact will be related to the timing of recognition of sales to certain distributors.
As described in Note 2, Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we currently defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers.
Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor.
We are continuing to evaluate the future impact and method of adoption of ASU 2014-09 and related amendments on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We will adopt ASU 2014-09, using the full retrospective method, upon its effective date for us which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
ITEM 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On March 10, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, an independent manufacturer of high performance analog integrated circuits, which we refer to as the Acquisition.
In connection with the Acquisition, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program.
The table below summarizes the activity related to stock repurchases for the three months ended May 5, 2018.
