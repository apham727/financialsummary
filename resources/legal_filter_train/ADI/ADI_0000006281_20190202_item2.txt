We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, including to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report, except to the extent required by law.
The fiscal year ending November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019) is a 52-week year and the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018) was a 53-week year.
The following tables summarize revenue by end market for the three-month periods ended February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018.
The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated.
As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time.
When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods.
Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.
Industrial, Automotive and Consumer end market revenues decreased in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of one less week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
In addition, Consumer end market revenues decreased in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year as a result of decreased demand for products used in portable consumer applications.
Communications end market revenue increased in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of a broad-based increase in demand for our products sold into this end market, partially offset by one less week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Gross margin percentage decreased by 90 basis points in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a higher concentration of our revenue from lower margin products.
As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years.
See Note 6, Special Charges, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.
The year-over-year decrease in nonoperating expense in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest expense and lower amortized finance fees, which were accelerated as a result of principal repayments related to our 3-year term loan.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to debt issuances in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events.
The tax rate also includes the effects of recording deferred tax benefits relating to a one-time set up of our GILTI deferred method election of $5.1 million along with the completion of our accounting for the transition tax which yielded a $7.5 million tax benefit.
It also included a provisional estimate of the discrete tax charge of $687.1 million from the Tax Legislation’s one-time transition tax associated with our undistributed foreign earnings, comprised of a $751.1 million transitional tax less a deferred tax liability of $64.0 million recorded in prior years.
Additionally, we recorded discrete benefits for excess tax benefits from share-based payments of $4.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $10.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The full year tax benefit from share-based payments was $26.2 million in fiscal 2018.
Non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues for the three-month period ended February
Non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues for the three-month period ended February 3, 2018.
See Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion.
Net income increased in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year,as a result of a $14.0 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $10.6 million decrease in nonoperating expense and a $37.2 million decrease in provision for income taxes.
At February 2, 2019, our principal source of liquidity was $605.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $231.7 million was held in the United States.
Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds.
We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.
We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.
At February 2, 2019, cash and cash equivalents totaled $605.9 million.
The following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.
Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of changes in working capital, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, as the first quarter of fiscal 2018 included changes to income tax related to the Tax Legislation.
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.
The increase in cash used for investing activities during the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of an increase in capital spending.
Financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans.
The change in cash related to financing activities during the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to a decrease in repayments on our 3-year unsecured term loan, partially offset by increases in stock repurchases and dividend payments.
The increase in accounts receivable in dollars was primarily the result of normal variations in the timing of collections and billings.
Inventory in dollars increased, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels.
The decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily a result of a decrease in accrued employee compensation and benefits, partially offset by an increase in accrued special charges.
On June 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2013.
On December 14, 2015, we issued the 2025 Notes and the 2045 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2016.

On March 12, 2018, we issued the 2020 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on March 12 and September 12 of each year, commencing September 12, 2018, and the January 2021 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on January 12 and July 12 of each year, commencing July 12, 2018.
$5.0 Billion Aggregate Principal Term Loans
On March 10, 2017 in connection with the acquisition of Linear, we drew down on a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022.
We have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on July 10, 2020.
The agreement for such revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) provides that we may borrow up to $1.0 billion.
In December 2018 we borrowed $75.0 million under this revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements.
We repaid the $75 million plus interest of $0.2 million in January 2019.
We may borrow under this revolving credit facility in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes.
The terms of the Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness.
In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 4.5 to 1.0.
The debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.0 to 1.0, which began in May 2018.
As of February 2, 2019, we were compliant with these covenants.
Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $91.0 million in the first three months of fiscal 2019 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
to be approximately 4% of fiscal 2019 revenue.
These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
On February 19, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.54 per outstanding share of common stock.
The dividend will be paid on March 12, 2019 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2019 and is expected to total approximately $198.9 million.
We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.54 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors.
There have not been any material changes during the three-month period ended February 2, 2019 to the amounts presented in the table summarizing our contractual obligations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018.
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The FASB has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations.
As a result of the adoption of ASU 2014-09, we changed our accounting policy for revenue recognition.
See Note 1, Basis of Presentation, and Note 2, Revenue Recognition, in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details of the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our financial statements.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740) (ASU 2016-16).
ASU 2016-16 requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.
ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
We adopted ASU 2016-16 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings.
The adoption of ASU 2016-16 resulted in a cumulative-effect increase in our deferred tax assets of approximately $1.7 billion and an increase to our deferred tax liabilities of $1.3 billion.
Except for the accounting policy for revenue recognition that was updated as a result of adopting ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), there were no other material changes in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019 to the information provided under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018.
