NetApp believes the hybrid cloud is fast becoming the dominant model for enterprise IT. Whether an organization is targeting an all-cloud, hybrid cloud, or multi-cloud strategy, NetApp Cloud Data Services accelerate the time it takes to deploy or develop an application by making the data requirements seamless to the application layer. 
Budget constraints and skill imbalances lead our customers to seek help in integrating, deploying and managing the solutions they need to stay competitive. This drives demand for converged and hyper-converged infrastructure solutions. FlexPod is the converged infrastructure of choice for many of the largest enterprises around the globe. Customers can break free from the limits of first-generation HCI with NetApp HCI and attain guaranteed performance with high levels flexibility, scale, automation, and integration with the Data Fabric. 
Flash plays a key role in customers’ digital transformation efforts as they seek to gain advantage through greater speed, responsiveness and value from key business applications - all while lowering total cost of ownership. All-flash array technology is the de facto choice for primary application workloads as customers seek performance and economic benefits from replacing hard disk installations. With a highly differentiated and broad portfolio of all-flash and hybrid array offerings, NetApp is well positioned to enable customers to accomplish this transition. 
To provide visibility into our transition from older products to our newer, higher growth products and clarity into the dynamics of our product revenue, we group our products by “Strategic” and “Mature” solutions. Strategic solutions include Clustered ONTAP, branded E-Series, SolidFire, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure, enterprise software license agreements (ELAs) and other optional add-on software products. Mature solutions include 7-mode ONTAP, add-on hardware and related operating system (OS) software and original equipment manufacturers (OEM) products. Both our Mature and Strategic product lines include a mix of disk, hybrid and all flash storage media. 
Additionally, we provide a variety of services including software maintenance, hardware maintenance and other services including professional services, global support solutions, and customer education and training to help customers most effectively manage their data. Revenues generated by our Cloud Data Services offerings are included in software maintenance revenues. 
As of the beginning of fiscal 2019, we adopted the new accounting standard Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) using the full retrospective method of adoption. Accordingly, our prior period condensed consolidated financial statements and supplementary data, as presented herein, have been restated to conform to the new rules. As illustrated in Note 6 – Revenue of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the overall impact of adoption was not significant to prior periods. However, application of the new rules to our ELAs resulted in approximately $90 million of product revenues for such arrangements in the first three months of fiscal 2019 that are incremental to the amount we would have recognized under the old standard. Under ASC 606, we recognize the software license fee component of our ELAs up-front, whereas under the prior rules the software license fee was recognized over the term of the ELA. 
Our fiscal year is reported as a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April. Fiscal years 2019 and 2018 are each 52-week years, with 13 weeks in each of their quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in April and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. 
Net revenues for the first quarter fiscal 2019 were $1,474 million, reflecting an increase of $153 million, or 12%, compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, primarily reflecting higher product revenues. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by three percentage points, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, reflecting higher margins on product revenues. Gross profit margins on product revenues increased six percentage points in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting high margins on revenue recognized during the current quarter related to the software license components of several ELAs, and, to a lesser extent, higher average selling prices (ASPs). 
The increase in net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues of $148 million. Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased four percentage points in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018. 
Total product revenue from mature solutions totaled $263 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, an increase of 15% from $229 million in in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, attributable to a 17% increase in add-on hardware, storage and related OS revenues and a 49% increase in OEM revenues. As of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we are no longer selling 7-mode systems, reflecting the movement of customers to our newer products. 
The fluctuations in software maintenance revenues reflect fluctuations in the aggregate contract value of the installed base under software maintenance contracts, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts.  
Hardware maintenance and other services revenues include hardware maintenance, professional services, and educational and training services revenues.  
Professional services and educational and training services revenues were $67 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $73 million for the corresponding period of the prior year.  
Americas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and U.S. public sector markets. Our geographic distribution of revenues as a percentage of net revenues was relatively consistent in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Cost of product revenues represented 45% of product revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 52% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Materials costs represented 87% of product costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 88% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Materials costs increased $16 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, primarily due to higher unit volumes of All-Flash FAS products.  
The benefit of high margins on revenue recognized during the current quarter related to the software license components of several ELAs, and an increase in ASP for strategic systems, resulting in higher margins for strategic solutions in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Margins for mature products were relatively consistent in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. 
Cost of software maintenance revenues was relatively flat in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 and represented 3% of software maintenance revenues for both periods. 
Total compensation costs included in operating expenses increased by $5 million, or 1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher salaries as a result of merit increases, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense. Average headcount was relatively consistent in both periods. 
The decrease in compensation costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year reflects a 2% decrease in average headcount and lower stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by higher average salaries, reflecting merit increases. Facilities and IT support costs decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to cost containment efforts. Commissions expense was relatively consistent in both quarters. 
The increase in compensation costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was attributable to an 8% increase in average headcount and higher average salaries, reflecting merit increases, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense. Development projects and outside services increased as a result of higher spending on materials and services associated with engineering activities to develop new products and enhance existing products. Depreciation expense decreased primarily due to certain equipment becoming fully depreciated. 
During the three months ended July 27, 2018, we announced a restructuring plan (the May 2018 Plan) to reduce costs and redirect resources to our highest return activities, which included a reduction in our global workforce of less than 2%. Charges related to the plan consisted primarily of employee severance-related costs. We expect to complete the May 2018 Plan by the second quarter of fiscal 2019 with no significant additional charges incurred. See Note 12 – Restructuring Charges of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. 
Interest income increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, primarily due to a shift in our investment portfolio to higher-yielding investments. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was -4.0% compared to an effective tax rate of 9.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Our effective tax rates reflect the impact of a significant amount of our earnings, primarily income from our European operations which are headquartered in the Netherlands, being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the U.S. statutory tax rate. Our effective tax rate decreased for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to the recognition of a $34 million discrete tax benefit for adjustments to certain intercompany transactions resulting from the retrospective application of the new revenue standard, and increased discrete benefits for stock-based compensation.  
Days sales outstanding, referred to as DSO, calculates the average collection period of our receivables. DSO is based on ending accounts receivable and net revenue for each period. DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable by average net revenue per day for the current quarter (91 days for each of the quarters presented above). DSO for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was relatively consistent with the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, while it decreased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 due to lower seasonal invoicing levels and more favorable shipping linearity. 
Days inventory outstanding, referred to as DIO, measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our products. DIO is based on ending inventory and cost of revenues for each period. DIO is calculated by dividing ending inventory by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter. DIO for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018, while it decreased compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower levels of purchased components on hand at the end of the current quarter.  
Days payables outstanding, referred to as DPO, calculates the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment. DPO is based on ending accounts payable and cost of revenues for each period. DPO is calculated by dividing accounts payable by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter. DPO for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of improved vendor payables management and an extension of payment terms with our suppliers. DPO for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to the timing of purchases from contract manufacturers. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we generated cash from operating activities of $326 million, reflecting net income of $283 million, adjusted by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $49 million, and stock-based compensation of $40 million, compared to $250 million of cash generated from operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  
Accounts receivable decreased $423 million, reflecting lower DSO. 
Accounts payable decreased $117 million, reflecting lower DPO. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we generated $248 million from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, and paid $64 million for capital expenditures, compared to $112 million and $36 million, respectively, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  
Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt. Based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including potential future issuances of debt, equity or other securities, will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements. We cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all. 
Our principal sources of liquidity as of July 27, 2018 consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and our commercial paper program and related credit facility.  
Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary technologies, service interest and principal payments on our debt, fund our stock repurchase program, and pay dividends, as and if declared. 
The principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of July 27, 2018.  
Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. For further information on the underlying terms, see Note 9 – Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In connection with the Program, we have a senior unsecured credit agreement that expires on December 10, 2021. The credit agreement provides a $1.0 billion revolving unsecured credit facility that serves as a back-up for the Program. Proceeds from the facility may also be used for general corporate purposes, providing another potential source of liquidity to the extent that the credit facility exceeds the outstanding debt issued under the Program. The credit agreement also includes options that allow us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $300 million and to extend its maturity date for two additional one-year periods, both subject to certain conditions. As of July 27, 2018, we were in compliance with all associated covenants in this agreement. No amounts were drawn against this facility during any of the periods presented. 
On August 15, 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock, payable on October 24, 2018 to holders of record as of the close of business on October 5, 2018. 
Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. Under this program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Since the May 13, 2003 inception of this program through July 27, 2018, we repurchased a total of 291 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $34.79 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $10.1 billion. As of July 27, 2018, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was $3.5 billion. 
As of July 27, 2018, future annual minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year totaled $184 million.  
In the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. As of July 27, 2018, we had $382 million in non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory. We record a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.  
In addition to inventory commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and construction related obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services. As of July 27, 2018, we had $5 million in construction related obligations and $195 million in other purchase obligations.  
While most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers. We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize product revenues for these arrangements, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions, upon product acceptance. We sold $30 million and $31 million of receivables during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. 
Some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases, we recognize revenues in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, as updated to reflect the adoption of ASC 606. In connection with certain recourse financing arrangements, we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights. As of July 27, 2018 and April 28, 2017, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant. To date, we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements. 
We have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements. As of July 27, 2018, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote. The portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business. See further details on such matters in Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.  
In May 2003, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. As of July 27, 2018, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock. Since inception of the program through July 27, 2018, we repurchased a total of 291 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.1 billion. Under this program, which we may suspend or discontinue at any time, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management.
