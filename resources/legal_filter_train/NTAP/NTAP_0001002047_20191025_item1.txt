NetApp, Inc. (we, us, or the Company) provides global organizations the ability to manage and share their data across on-premises, private and public clouds.
Together with our partners, we provide a full range of enterprise-class software, systems and services solutions that customers use to modernize their infrastructures, build next generation data centers and harness the power of hybrid clouds.
Our fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week year ending on the last Friday in April.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company, and reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for the interim periods presented.
The statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information.
Accordingly, these statements do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for annual consolidated financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2019 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The results of operations for the three and six months ended October 25, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full fiscal year or future operating periods.
Such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, reserves and allowances; inventory valuation and purchase order accruals; valuation of goodwill and intangibles; restructuring reserves; product warranties; employee compensation and benefit accruals; stock-based compensation; loss contingencies; investment impairments; income taxes and fair value measurements.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update on financial reporting for leasing arrangements, including requiring lessees to recognize an operating lease with a term greater than one year on their balance sheets as a right-of-use (ROU) asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted this new standard using the modified retrospective approach, electing the optional transition approach of not adjusting our comparative period financial statements for the impacts of adoption.
We also elected the package of practical expedients that did not require us to reassess existing leases under the new guidance, and the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases.
Adoption of the new standard on April 27, 2019 resulted in the recognition of approximately $149 million of operating lease ROU assets, net of deferred rent and lease restructuring liabilities, $158 million of lease liabilities, and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of $6 million on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of operations or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
Additional information is presented below and in Note 9 – Leases.
Leases − We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception, and we classify leases as operating or finance leases at commencement.
In our condensed consolidated balance sheets, operating lease ROU assets are included in other non-current assets, while finance lease ROU assets are included in property and equipment, net.
Lease liabilities for both types of leases are included in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over that term.
Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
As the rate implicit in our leases is typically not readily determinable, in computing the present value of lease payments we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date.
Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are expensed as incurred and not included within the calculation of ROU assets and lease liabilities.
We do not separate non-lease components from lease components for any class of leases, and we do not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.
There have been no other significant changes in our significant accounting policies as of and for the six months ended October 25, 2019, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2019.
The standard introduces a new model for measuring and recognizing credit losses on financial instruments, requiring financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
It also requires that credit losses be recorded through an allowance for credit losses.
This new standard will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2021, although early adoption is permitted.
Based on the composition of our investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
On May 23, 2019, we acquired all the outstanding shares of privately-held Cognigo Research Ltd., a provider of data discovery classification software designed to manage and protect critical data, for $58 million in cash.
The results of operations related to this acquisition have been included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the acquisition was not material to our results of operations.
In September 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell certain land and buildings located in Sunnyvale, California, through two separate and independent closings, the first of which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The remaining properties, consisting of land, were classified as assets held for sale, and included as other current assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of April 26, 2019.
On August 29, 2019, the second closing occurred and we consummated the sale of the land, with a net book value of $53 million, and received cash proceeds of $96 million, resulting in a gain, net of direct selling costs, of $38 million.
Other non-current assets as of October 25, 2019 and April 26, 2019 includes $77 million and $78 million, respectively, for our 49% non-controlling equity interest in Lenovo NetApp Technology Limited, a China-based entity that we formed with Lenovo (Beijing) Information Technology Ltd. in fiscal 2019.
Warranty expense accrued during the period includes amounts accrued for systems at the time of shipment, adjustments for changes in estimated costs for warranties on systems shipped in the period and changes in estimated costs for warranties on systems shipped in prior periods.
 To provide visibility into our transition from older products to our newer, higher growth products and clarity into the dynamics of our product revenue, we group our products by “Strategic” and “Mature” solutions.
Prior to this grouping change, Hybrid FAS products and branded E-Series were included in Strategic, while all add-on hardware and OS software were included in Mature.
In addition to the sale of our products and solutions, we provide a variety of services to our customers, including software maintenance, hardware maintenance and other services including professional services, global support solutions, and customer education and training.
Deferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to undelivered product commitments and other product deliveries that have not met all revenue recognition criteria.
Deferred services revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services, which include software and hardware maintenance contracts and other services.
See Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies for additional information related to these arrangements.
 During the six months ended October 25, 2019 and October 26, 2018, we recognized $1,045 million and $1,019 million, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue balance at the beginning of the respective periods.
 As of October 25, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations related to customer contracts that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was $3,468 million, which is equivalent to our deferred revenue and unearned services revenue balance.
Because customer orders are typically placed on an as-needed basis, and cancellable without penalty prior to shipment, orders in backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue and have not been included in this amount.
We expect to recognize as revenue approximately 49% of our deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue balance in the next 12 months, approximately 26% in the next 13 to 24 months, and the remainder thereafter.
We consider an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and consider an inactive market to be one in which there are infrequent or few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers.
Where appropriate, our own or the counterparty’s non-performance risk is considered in measuring the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.
 During the six months ended October 25, 2019, we sold approximately $1.0 billion of corporate bonds held by foreign subsidiaries and recognized a gain on sale of $14 million, which is presented in other income, net on our condensed consolidated statement of operations.
Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.
Our Level 2 debt instruments are held by a custodian who prices some of the investments using standard inputs in various asset price models or obtains investment prices from third-party pricing providers that incorporate standard inputs in various asset price models.
These pricing providers utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs like market transactions involving identical or comparable securities.
We review Level 2 inputs and fair value for reasonableness and the values may be further validated by comparison to multiple independent pricing sources.
In addition, we review third-party pricing provider models, key inputs and assumptions and understand the pricing processes at our third-party providers in determining the overall reasonableness of the fair value of our Level 2 debt instruments.
As of October 25, 2019 and April 26, 2019, we have not made any adjustments to the prices obtained from our third-party pricing providers.
As of October 25, 2019 and April 26, 2019, the fair value of our long-term debt was approximately $1,174 million and $1,553 million, respectively.
The fair value of our long-term debt was based on observable market prices in a less active market.
All of our debt obligations are categorized as Level 2 instruments.
On September 27, 2019, we made an aggregate cash payment of $400 million to extinguish our 2.00% Senior Notes at maturity.
Our 3.30% Senior Notes, with a principal amount of $400 million, were issued in September 2017.
Our 3.375% Senior Notes and 3.25% Senior Notes, with principal amounts of $500 million and $250 million, respectively, were issued in June 2014 and December 2012, respectively.
Our Senior Notes, which are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness.
We may redeem the Senior Notes in whole or in part, at any time at our option at specified redemption prices.
In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the Senior Notes under specified terms.
The Senior Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens on assets or on shares of stock or indebtedness of our subsidiaries; to engage in certain sale and lease-back transactions; and to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.
We have a commercial paper program (the Program), under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes.
Amounts available under the Program, as amended in July 2017, may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $1.0 billion.
The maturities of the notes can vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue.
The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance.
As of October 25, 2019, we had commercial paper notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $499 million, a weighted-average interest rate of 2.20% and maturities ranging from 7 days to 91 days.
As of April 26, 2019, we had commercial paper notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $249 million, a weighted-average interest rate of 2.73% and maturities ranging from 27 days to 38 days.
Proceeds from the facility may also be used for general corporate purposes to the extent that the credit facility exceeds the outstanding debt issued under the Program.
The credit agreement includes options that allow us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $300 million and to extend its maturity date for two additional one-year periods, both subject to certain conditions.
We lease real estate, equipment and automobiles in the U.S. and internationally.
Our real estate leases, which are responsible for the majority of our aggregate ROU asset and liability balances, include leases for office space, data centers and other facilities, and have remaining lease terms of up to 15 years.
Some of these leases contain options that allow us to extend or terminate the lease agreement.
Our equipment leases are primarily for servers and networking equipment and have remaining lease terms of up to 4 years, while our automobile leases have remaining lease terms of up to 5 years.
All our leases are classified as operating leases except for certain immaterial equipment finance leases.
Variable lease cost is primarily attributable to amounts paid to lessors for common area maintenance and utility charges under our real estate leases.
As of October 25, 2019, we have certain equity incentive awards (awards) outstanding, which include stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs), including time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs (PBRSUs).
Also outstanding are purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).
During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the 1999 Stock Option Plan, under which stock options and RSUs are granted, was extended for a 10 year term.
The aggregate intrinsic value represents the pre-tax difference between the exercise price of stock options and the quoted market price of our stock on that day for all in-the-money options.
As of October 25, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to our equity awards was $339 million, which is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining service period of 2.3 years.
Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock.
Under this program, which we may suspend or discontinue at any time, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management.
The aggregate purchase price of our stock repurchases for the six months ended October 25, 2019 consisted of $750 million of open market purchases, of which $398 million and $352 million were allocated to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, respectively.
Since the May 13, 2003 inception of our stock repurchase program through October 25, 2019, we repurchased a total of 327 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $38.20 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $12.5 billion.
On November 13, 2019, we declared a cash dividend of $0.48 per share of common stock, payable on January 22, 2020 to holders of record as of the close of business on January 3, 2020.
The timing and amount of future dividends will depend on market conditions, corporate business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements.
During the first six months of fiscal 2020, realized gains of $14 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities were recorded in other income, net on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk.
Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes.
Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of our agreements with them.
We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions.
In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
We also have in place master netting arrangements to mitigate the credit risk of our counterparties and to potentially reduce our losses due to counterparty nonperformance.
We present our derivative instruments as net amounts in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The gross and net fair value amounts of such instruments were not material as of October 25, 2019 or April 26, 2019.
The effect of cash flow hedges recognized in net revenues on our condensed consolidated statements of operations was immaterial in all periods presented.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we announced a restructuring plan (the May 2019 Plan) to reduce costs and redirect resources to our highest return activities, which included a reduction in our global workforce by approximately 2%.
Charges related to the plan consisted primarily of employee severance-related costs.
Management has previously approved several restructuring actions, including the May 2018 Plan and April 2019 Plan, under which we reduced our global workforce by less than 2%, and approximately 1%, respectively.
Charges related to our restructuring plans consisted primarily of employee severance-related costs.
Substantially all activities under the May 2018 Plan were completed as of the end of fiscal 2019.
We expect to complete all activities associated with the April 2019 plan by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 with no significant additional charges.
The differences in effective tax rates for the six months ended October 25, 2019 and October 26, 2018 were primarily due to discrete tax benefits related to the adoption of the new revenue standard in fiscal 2019, the discrete tax charge on the sale of land in Sunnyvale, California in fiscal 2020 and the differences in discrete benefits for stock-based compensation.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into law.
As of April 26, 2019, we had completed the accounting for the tax impacts of the TCJA, however, we will continue to assess the impact of further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on our business and consolidated financial statements, and recognize any adjustments in the period in which they are determined.
During fiscal 2019, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard and for the six months ended October 26, 2018, we recognized a $34 million discrete tax benefit for adjustments to certain intercompany transactions resulting from the retrospective application of the new revenue accounting standard.
As of October 25, 2019, we had $294 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits.
Transfer pricing calculations are key issues under audits in various jurisdictions, and are often subject to dispute and appeals.
In September 2010, the Danish Tax Authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 by our Danish subsidiary were subject to Danish at-source dividend withholding tax.
We do not believe that our Danish subsidiary is liable for such withholding tax and filed an appeal with the Danish Tax Tribunal.
In December 2011, the Danish Tax Tribunal issued a ruling in favor of NetApp.
In February 2016, the DHC requested a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
The CJEU was not bound by the opinion of the Advocate General and issued its preliminary ruling in February 2019.
The CJEU ruling did not preclude the Danish Tax Authorities from imposing withholding tax on distributions based on the benefits of certain European Union directives.
The preliminary ruling will be reviewed and may be subjected to additional briefing by the DHC.
We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.
We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude, certain statutes of limitations will lapse, or both.
Six million and three million potential shares from outstanding employee equity awards were excluded from the diluted net income per share calculations for the three and six months ended October 25, 2019, respectively, as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, while no potential shares were excluded from the calculation for the three or six months ended October 26, 2018.
Americas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and U.S. public sector markets.
In the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to third-party contract manufacturers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacturing of our products.
A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments.
As of October 25, 2019 and April 26, 2019, such liability amounted to $13 million and $16 million, respectively, and is included in accrued expenses in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.
In addition to inventory commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not yet received goods or services.
As of October 25, 2019, we had $5 million in construction related obligations and $244 million in other purchase obligations.
While most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers.
We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables.
Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize product revenues for these arrangements, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions, upon product acceptance.
In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products.
These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users.
The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery to the end-user customer, if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default.
Where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases and collectability is probable, we account for these transactions as sales type leases.
If collectability is not probable, the cash received is recorded as a deposit liability and revenue is deferred until the arrangement is deemed collectible.
For leases that we are not a party to, other than providing recourse, we recognize revenue when control is transferred.
As of October 25, 2019 and April 26, 2019, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant.
To date, we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements.
We have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements.
If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid financing payments under such arrangements.
As of October 25, 2019, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote.
The portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss.
However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency.
On August 14, 2019, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, naming as defendants NetApp and certain of our executive officers.
The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements with respect to our financial guidance for fiscal 2020, as provided on May 22, 2019.
Members of the alleged class are purchasers of the Company’s stock between May 22, 2019 and August 1, 2019, the date we provided revised financial guidance for fiscal 2020.
The complaint alleges unspecified damages based on the decline in the market price of our shares following the issuance of the revised guidance on August 1, 2019.
We believe the complaint is without merit and intend to defend the case vigorously.
Unfavorable resolutions could include significant monetary damages.
In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways or requiring other remedies.
Risk Factors.
The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.
These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-Q or elsewhere.
The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes in Part I, Item 1 – Financial Statements and Part I, Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-Q.
The following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face.
Our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and services.
Due to the complexity of storage software, subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services, such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks.
We may not be able to provide products, service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities.
We offer customers a full range of consumption models, including the deployment of our software through our subscription and cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS), and utility pricing and managed services offerings for our hardware and software systems.
As customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases, we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional hardware and software license arrangements, including for the software license components of enterprise software license agreements (for which revenue is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery), relative to our consumption model offerings, (for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement).
We incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings.
Increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business and operating results.
The storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and fragmentation.
We compete with many companies in the markets we serve, including established public companies, newer public companies with a strong flash focus, and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyper-converged systems.
Some offer a broad spectrum of IT products and services (full-stack vendors) and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services.
Technology trends, such as the emergence of hosted or public cloud storage, SaaS and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements.
Cloud service providers provide customers storage for their data centers on demand, without requiring a capital expenditure, which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has changed the competitive landscape.
By extending our flash, converged infrastructure and cloud storage offerings, we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors, particularly smaller emerging storage vendors.
The longer-term potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined.
In cloud and converged infrastructure, we also compete with large well-established competitors.
For additional information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Item 1 – Business of Part I of this Form 10-K.
It is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or buying power.
An increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as full-stack vendors for customers and achieve increased economies of scale in the supply chain.
In addition, current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including some of our partners or suppliers.
The impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive, and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain.
Seasonality, such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the second quarter of our fiscal year, with the latter due in part to the impact of the U.S. federal government’s September 30 fiscal year end on the timing of its orders; and
Unpredictability associated with larger scale enterprise software license agreements which generally take longer to negotiate and occur less consistently than other types of contracts, and for which revenue attributable to the software license component is typically recognized in full upon delivery.
If we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners, our revenues may be harmed.
Our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co-market our products with them.
A number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets.
In particular, strategic partnerships with hyperscalers and cloud service vendors are critical to the success of our cloud-based business.
However, there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners, and these relationships may not be exclusive, may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice.
For instance, some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors, which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners.
Moreover, some of our partners, particularly large, more diversified technology companies, are also competitors, thereby complicating our relationships.
A portion of our revenues is generated by large, recurring purchases from various customers, resellers and distributors.
We generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers, resellers and distributors for extended periods of time, and thus there is no guarantee we will continue to receive large, recurring orders from these customers, resellers or distributors.
For example, our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases, and our customers, resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time.
Our gross margins vary.
The costs of third-party components comprise a significant portion of our product costs.
If we do not achieve forecasted bookings in any quarter, our financial results could be harmed.
Bookings typically follow intra-quarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products, including certain single source suppliers, which has subjected us, and could in the future subject us, to price rigidity, periodic supply constraints, and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded.
Consolidation among suppliers, particularly within the semiconductor and disk drive industries, has contributed to price rigidity and may in the future create supply constraints.
When industry supply is constrained, our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors, all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do.
New manufacturers, products, components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers.
Any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality, quantity or delivery requirements in a cost-effective manner will harm our business, operating results and customer relationships.
Due to the global nature of our business, risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business.
Accordingly, our business and future operating results could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our international operations including, among other things, local political or economic conditions, trade protection and export and import requirements, tariffs, local labor conditions, transportation costs, government spending patterns, acts of terrorism, international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure.
In particular, the current trade tensions between the U.S. and China, including newly imposed tariffs, and the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, which is now scheduled to be effective on January 31, 2020, could impact our business and operating results.
For products we manufacture in Mexico, tensions between the U.S. and Mexico related to trade and border security issues could delay our shipments to customers, or impact pricing or our business and operating results.
In addition, due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products, including antitrust and anti-competition laws, rules and regulations, and regulations related to data privacy.
We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations.
These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.
We utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities.
In addition, our foreign currency exposure on assets, liabilities and cash flows that we do not hedge could have a material impact on our financial results in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to foreign currencies.
We base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed.
We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in engineering, sales, service and support, marketing and other functions to support and grow our business.
Our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.
Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations or a change in how we manage our international operations could adversely affect our ability to continue realizing these tax benefits.
Many countries around the world are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and related action plans that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules and nexus-based tax incentive practices.
As a result, many of these changes, if enacted, could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.
Our clients may authorize third-party technology providers to access their data on our systems.
Because we do not control the transmissions between our clients, their customers, and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.
Errors or wrongdoing by clients, their customers, or third-party technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us.
We store and transmit personal, sensitive and proprietary data related to our products, our employees, customers, clients and partners (including third-party vendors such as data centers and providers of SaaS, cloud computing, and internet infrastructure and bandwidth), and their respective customers, including intellectual property, books of record and personal information.
It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure, products and services remain secure and are perceived by customers, clients and partners to be secure.
There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, human error and technological vulnerabilities.
Cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in (1) unauthorized access to, or loss or unauthorized disclosure of, such information; (2) litigation, indemnity obligations, government investigations and other possible liabilities; (3) negative publicity; and (4) disruptions to our internal and external operations.
In addition, a cybersecurity incident or loss of personal information could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues.
Our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data.
We do not review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store, and, therefore, we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms.
High-profile cyberattacks and security breaches have increased in recent years, and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting IT products and businesses.
Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
As we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand, we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems and we anticipate that hacking attempts and cyberattacks will increase in the future.
We cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems.
Our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim.
The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions.
Equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs.
In addition, because of the structure of our sales, cash and equity incentive compensation plans, we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times.
For example, the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of annual bonuses or the vesting of equity awards.
As part of our strategy, we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products, expand the breadth of our markets, or enhance our technical capabilities.
For example, in May 2019 (fiscal 2020), we acquired a privately held company, in fiscal 2018 we acquired two privately held companies, and in fiscal 2016 we acquired SolidFire, Inc.
The benefits we have received, and expect to receive, from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence, negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems, procedures and organizational structure.
The failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets.
In addition, we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the U.S. government.
The U.S. government is an important customer for us.
However, government demand is uncertain, as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints.
Events such as the U.S. federal government shutdown from December 2018 to January 2019 and continued uncertainty regarding the U.S. budget and debt levels have increased demand uncertainty for our products, and in our fiscal 2016 resulted in lower sales to these customers.
If the U.S. government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the U.S. government continue to reduce or shift their IT spending patterns, our revenues and operating results may be harmed.
Selling our products to the U.S. government, whether directly or through channel partners, also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements.
As an example, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the General Services Administration (GSA) have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with IT vendors, including us and several of our competitors and channel partners, under the False Claims Act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of GSA contracts for sales to the federal government.
Violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements, including with respect to data security, could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting.
We continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient, including by moving our business activities from higher-cost to lower-cost locations, outsourcing certain business processes and functions, and implementing changes to our business information systems.
These efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes.
In addition, as we move operations into lower-cost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes, we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and, as a consequence, become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of third-parties.
In addition, all our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants.
If we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements.
We are exposed to credit risks and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities.
As a result, the value and liquidity of our investments may fluctuate substantially.
Our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage and data management industry may harm our business.
Emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the UNIX®, Windows® and World Wide Web server markets upon which we depend.
For example, we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical and government market segments, industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access, reliability and permanence in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate.
If our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard, customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products, and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted.
Some of our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold, distributed, or delivered, and any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
The U.S., through the BIS and OFAC, places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons.
Violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties, which may include significant monetary fines, criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees, a denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government.
Our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties, including potentially our channel partners, despite our precautions.
Even if we were not found to have violated such laws, the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm.
The laws and regulations governing the manufacturing, sourcing, distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time.
For example, in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions and the use and discharge of hazardous materials, the SEC adopted regulations concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries.
We incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products.
Our success depends significantly upon developing, maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology.
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees, resellers, strategic partners and customers, to protect our proprietary rights.
We currently have multiple U.S. and international patent applications pending and multiple U.S. and international patents issued.
The pending applications may not be approved, and our existing and future patents may be challenged.
If such challenges are brought, the patents may be invalidated.
Any such litigation may be time-consuming and costly.
Such claims may be made against our products and services, our customers’ use of our products and services, or a combination of our products and third-party products.
If we refuse to indemnify or defend such claims, even in situations in which the third-party’s allegations are meritless, then customers and resellers may refuse to do business with us.
We expect that companies in the network storage and data management markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps.
Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
We are exposed to the credit and non-payment risk of our customers, resellers and distributors, especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets, which could result in material losses.
Most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days.
We may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay.
Beyond our open credit arrangements, some of our customers have entered into recourse and non-recourse financing leasing arrangements using third-party leasing companies.
Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default.
During periods of economic uncertainty, our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases.
In addition, our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions.
Our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events.
We depend on the ability of our personnel, inventories, equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world.
Any political, military, terrorism, global trade, world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions.
Furthermore, any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters, including fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanoes; power loss or shortages; environmental disasters; telecommunications or business information systems failures or break-ins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business.
