To provide visibility into our transition from older products to our newer, higher growth products and clarity into the dynamics of our product revenue, we have historically grouped our products by “Strategic” and “Mature” solutions.
Strategic solutions include Clustered ONTAP, branded E-Series, SolidFire, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure, enterprise software license agreements (ELAs) and other optional add-on software products.
Both our Mature and Strategic product lines include a mix of disk, hybrid and all flash storage media.
Revenues generated by our Cloud Data Services offerings are included in software maintenance revenues.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 22 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $74.17 per share, for an aggregate of $1,611 million.
As of the beginning of fiscal 2019, we adopted the new accounting standard Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) using the full retrospective method of adoption.
Accordingly, our prior period condensed consolidated financial statements and supplementary data, as presented herein, have been restated to conform to the new rules.
As illustrated in Note 5 – Revenue of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the overall impact of adoption was not significant to prior periods.
However, application of the new rules to our ELAs resulted in approximately $110 million of product revenues for such arrangements in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, that are incremental to the amounts we would have recognized under the old standard.
None of this incremental revenue was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Under ASC 606, we recognize the software license fee component of our ELAs up-front, whereas under the prior rules the software license fee was recognized over the term of the ELA.
There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates as filed in such report, except with respect to revenue recognition as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Refer to Note 5 – Revenue of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details.
Our fiscal year is reported as a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April.
Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in April and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
Net revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 were $1,563 million and $4,554 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $24 million, or 2%, and $279 million, or 7%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily reflecting higher product revenues, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the third quarter.
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the third quarter increased by half of one percentage point compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, and increased one and a half percentage points in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 when compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting higher margins on product revenues, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the third quarter.
Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 totaled $671 million, or 43% of net revenues and $2,049 million, or 45% of net revenues, respectively, representing a decrease of one and a half percentage points and three percentage points when compared to the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, primarily due to higher net revenues in the current year periods.
The increase in net revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues of $15 million and $257 million, respectively.
Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues were flat in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and increased two percentage points in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018.
Product revenues from strategic solutions represented 70% of product revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to 69% in the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled $674 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 3% increase from $657 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to increased sales of All-Flash FAS products and hyper-converged infrastructure solutions, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
Total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled $1,935 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 12% increase from $1,721 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Contributing to this increase was over $110 million of revenues from the software license component of several ELAs in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 which, under ASC 606, were recognized up-front.
Comparable ELA revenues were immaterial in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Revenues generated from the sale of optional add-on software unrelated to ELAs, All-Flash FAS products and hyperconverged infrastructure solutions also increased in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding period of the prior year.
Software maintenance revenues are associated with contracts which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes and patch releases, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers.
The fluctuations in software maintenance revenues reflect fluctuations in the aggregate contract value of the installed base under software maintenance contracts, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts.
Hardware maintenance and other services revenues include hardware maintenance, professional services, and educational and training services revenues.
Hardware maintenance contract revenues decreased slightly year over year, at $292 million and $898 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to $300 million and $904 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Professional services and educational and training services revenues were $65 million and $197 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to $66 million and $205 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Americas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and U.S. public sector markets.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Americas revenues were negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in the region.
Cost of product revenues represented 49% and 47% of product revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to 49% and 50% for the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018.
Materials costs represented 90% of product costs for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to 91% and 90% in the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018.
Materials costs decreased $8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, primarily due to a decline in the price of certain product components.
Materials costs increased $39 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, primarily due to higher unit volumes of certain products.
The average unit materials costs of Clustered ONTAP systems decreased slightly in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, while it increased slightly in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior year.
Margins on revenue recognized for strategic solutions were relatively flat during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, while they were higher during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior year due to the benefit of high margins realized on the software license components of several ELAs, and, to a lesser extent, higher ASPs.
Margins for mature products increased slightly in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Cost of software maintenance revenues in dollars was relatively flat in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018 and represented 4% of software maintenance revenues for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019.
Costs represented 29% of hardware maintenance and other services revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to 30% in the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Included in compensation costs are salaries, benefits, other compensation-related costs, stock-based compensation expense and employee incentive compensation plan costs.
Total compensation costs included in operating expenses decreased by $5 million, or 1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding period of the prior year primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by higher salaries and stock-based compensation expenses, reflecting a slight increase in average headcount.
Compensation costs decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, reflecting a slight decrease in average headcount.
The increase in compensation costs for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year was attributable to an increase in average headcount of 6% and 7%, respectively, resulting in higher salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
The increase in headcount reflects our investment in additional engineering resources to support the expansion and enhancement of products and solutions targeted at our most important customer and market opportunities.
Development projects and outside services expense for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased as a result of higher spending on materials and services associated with engineering activities to develop new products and enhance existing ones.
Facilities and IT support costs increased in the current year periods in connection with the increase in average headcount.
The decrease in compensation costs for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year was attributable to lower incentive compensation and salaries expense, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the third quarter.
While average headcount increased in the current year periods, salaries expense decreased because a greater percentage of employees were located in lower cost geographies.
The decrease in facilities and IT support costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior year was primarily due to lower spending levels on IT projects.
Charges related to the plan consisted primarily of employee severance-related costs.
Substantially all activities under the plan have been completed.
See Note 11 – Restructuring Charges of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.
In September 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell certain land and buildings located in Sunnyvale, California, through two separate and independent closings.
Upon the completion of the first closing in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we consummated the sale of properties with a net book value of $66 million for cash proceeds of $210 million, resulting in a gain, net of direct selling costs, of $142 million.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, our continuing involvement with properties subject to a sale-leaseback arrangement entered into in fiscal 2016 ended, and as a result we recorded a non-cash sale of properties, extinguished the associated financing obligation and recognized a gain of $76 million.
Interest income increased in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to a shift in our investment portfolio to higher-yielding investments, partially offset by a decrease in the size of the portfolio.
Interest expense declined in the current year periods due to a reduction in the average amount of interest-bearing debt outstanding.
Other income, net decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year primarily due to lower net foreign exchange gains.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 21.9% compared to an effective tax rate of 195.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was 12.6% compared to an effective tax rate of 120.0% for the corresponding period of fiscal 2018.
Our effective tax rates decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year primarily due to the provisional impacts of U.S. tax reform, and the sale of certain land in Sunnyvale, California, which resulted in aggregate discrete tax charges of $856 million and $72 million, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we finalized our computation of the transition tax and recorded a reduction of $5 million to our provisional amount.
Under U.S. GAAP, companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election to either (i) account for GMT as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules, or (ii) account for GMT in a company’s measurement of deferred taxes.
We have elected to recognize the GMT as a period cost.
As of January 25, 2019, we had $382 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits.
The decrease was primarily due to $1.6 billion paid for the repurchase of our common stock, $306 million used for the payment of dividends, $221 million used for the net repayment of commercial paper notes, and $138 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $942 million of cash provided by operating activities.
Days sales outstanding, referred to as DSO, calculates the average collection period of our receivables.
DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable by average net revenue per day for the current quarter (91 days for each of the quarters presented above).
DSO for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 primarily due to one of our major distributors choosing not to take advantage of an early payment discount in the current quarter, while it decreased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 due to lower seasonal invoicing levels and more favorable shipping linearity.
Days inventory outstanding, referred to as DIO, measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our products.
DIO is calculated by dividing ending inventory by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter.
DIO for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher levels of finished goods on hand at the end of the current quarter, while it decreased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 due to lower levels of finished goods on hand at the end of the current quarter.
Days payables outstanding, referred to as DPO, calculates the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment.
DPO is based on ending accounts payable and cost of revenues for each period.
DPO is calculated by dividing accounts payable by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter.
DPO for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, due to differences in the timing of purchases from and payments to our suppliers.
DPO for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to the timing of purchases from contract manufacturers.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we generated cash from operating activities of $942 million, reflecting net income of $773 million, adjusted by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $149 million, and stock-based compensation of $121 million, compared to $984 million of cash generated from operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Accounts receivable decreased $165 million, reflecting lower DSO.
Accounts payable decreased $101 million, reflecting lower DPO.
Accrued expenses decreased $85 million, primarily due to employee compensation payouts related to fiscal year 2018 commissions and incentive compensation plans.
Long-term taxes payable decreased $60 million, primarily due to transition taxes associated with U.S. tax reform.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we generated $661 million from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, and paid $138 million for capital expenditures, while during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we used $178 million for the purchase of investments, net of maturities and sales, and paid $97 million for capital expenditures.
Additionally, during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we paid $75 million to acquire two privately-held companies, and received proceeds of $210 million from the sale of properties.
Based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including potential future issuances of debt, equity or other securities, will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Our principal sources of liquidity as of January 25, 2019 consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and our commercial paper program and related credit facility.
As of January 25, 2019 and April 27, 2018, $3.8 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings, while $0.2 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, were available in the U.S. at the end of each period.
Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary technologies, service interest and principal payments on our debt, fund our stock repurchase program, and pay dividends, as and if declared.
We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible.
Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually.
For further information on the underlying terms, see Note 8 – Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have a commercial paper program (the Program), under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes.
Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $1.0 billion.
The maturities of the notes can vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue.
The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance.
As of January 25, 2019, we had commercial paper notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $164 million, a weighted-average interest rate of 2.87% and maturities ranging from 27 days to 36 days.
Proceeds from the facility may also be used for general corporate purposes, providing another potential source of liquidity to the extent that the credit facility exceeds the outstanding debt issued under the Program.
The credit agreement also includes options that allow us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $300 million and to extend its maturity date for two additional one-year periods, both subject to certain conditions.
We expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our commitments related to facilities, equipment, operating leases and internal-use software development projects over the next few years through existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations.
We anticipate capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal 2019 to be between $50 million and $100 million.
On February 13, 2019, we declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock, payable on April 24, 2019 to holders of record as of the close of business on April 5, 2019.
Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.
Under this program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management.
The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
Since the May 13, 2003 inception of this program through January 25, 2019, we repurchased a total of 306 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $36.72 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $11.2 billion.
As of January 25, 2019, future annual minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year totaled $164 million.
In the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products.
A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments.
As of January 25, 2019, we had $501 million in non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory.
In addition to inventory commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and construction related obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services.
As of January 25, 2019, we had $4 million in construction related obligations and $220 million in other purchase obligations.
While most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers.
We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables.
Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize product revenues for these arrangements, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions, upon product acceptance.
We sold $54 million and $62 million of receivables during the nine months ended January 25, 2019 and January 26, 2018, respectively.
In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products.
These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users.
Some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions.
Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default.
These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets.
Where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases, we recognize revenues in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, as updated to reflect the adoption of ASC 606.
In connection with certain recourse financing arrangements, we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights.
As of January 25, 2019 and April 28, 2017, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant.
We have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements.
If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements.
As of January 25, 2019, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote.
We enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business.
These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance.
See further details on such matters in Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
In May 2003, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program.
As of January 25, 2019, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock.
Since inception of the program through January 25, 2019, we repurchased a total of 306 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $11.2 billion.
Under this program, which we may suspend or discontinue at any time, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management.
