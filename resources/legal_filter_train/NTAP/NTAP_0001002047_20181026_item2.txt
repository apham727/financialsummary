To provide visibility into our transition from older products to our newer, higher growth products and clarity into the dynamics of our product revenue, we have historically grouped our products by “Strategic” and “Mature” solutions. Strategic solutions include Clustered ONTAP, branded E-Series, SolidFire, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure, enterprise software license agreements (ELAs) and other optional add-on software products. Mature solutions include 7-mode ONTAP, add-on hardware and related operating system (OS) software and original equipment manufacturers (OEM) products. Both our Mature and Strategic product lines include a mix of disk, hybrid and all flash storage media. 
Additionally, we provide a variety of services including software maintenance, hardware maintenance and other services including professional services, global support solutions, and customer education and training to help customers most effectively manage their data. Revenues generated by our Cloud Data Services offerings are included in software maintenance revenues. 
As of the beginning of fiscal 2019, we adopted the new accounting standard Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) using the full retrospective method of adoption. Accordingly, our prior period condensed consolidated financial statements and supplementary data, as presented herein, have been restated to conform to the new rules. As illustrated in Note 5 – Revenue of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the overall impact of adoption was not significant to prior periods. However, application of the new rules to our ELAs resulted in approximately $20 million and $110 million of product revenues for such arrangements in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, that are incremental to the amounts we would have recognized under the old standard. Under ASC 606, we recognize the software license fee component of our ELAs up-front, whereas under the prior rules the software license fee was recognized over the term of the ELA. 
Our fiscal year is reported as a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April. Fiscal years 2019 and 2018 are each 52-week years, with 13 weeks in each of their quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in April and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. 
Net revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 were $1,517 million and $2,991 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $102 million, or 7%, and $255 million, or 9%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, reflecting higher product revenues. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the second quarter increased by half of one percentage point compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, and increased almost two percentage points in the first six months of fiscal 2019 when compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting higher margins on product revenues. Gross profit margins on product revenues increased one and a half percentage points in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and four percentage points in the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting high margins on revenue recognized during the current year periods related to the software license components of several ELAs, and, to a lesser extent, higher average selling prices (ASPs).  
Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2019 totaled $688 million, or 45% of net revenues and $1,378 million, or 46% of net revenues, respectively, representing a decrease of three percentage points and four percentage points when compared to the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, primarily due to higher net revenues in the current year periods. 
The increase in net revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues of $94 million and $242 million, respectively. Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased two percentage points and three percentage points in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018. 
Total product revenue from mature solutions totaled $264 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 4% increase from $253 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Total product revenue from mature solutions totaled $527 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 9% increase from $482 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018. These increases are primarily due to an increase in add-on hardware, storage and related OS revenues of 11% and 14% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of prior year. Additionally, OEM revenues increased by 6% and 25% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year. These increases were partially offset by our discontinuation of the 7-mode systems in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting the movement of customers to our newer products.  
The fluctuations in software maintenance revenues reflect fluctuations in the aggregate contract value of the installed base under software maintenance contracts, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts.  
Hardware maintenance and other services revenues include hardware maintenance, professional services, and educational and training services revenues.  
Hardware maintenance contract revenues were relatively flat year over year, at $303 million and $606 million, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to $306 million and $604 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of the prior year.  
Professional services and educational and training services revenues were $65 million and $132 million, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to $66 million and $139 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of the prior year.  
Americas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and U.S. public sector markets. Our geographic distribution of revenues as a percentage of net revenues was relatively consistent in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018. 
Cost of product revenues represented 47% and 46% of product revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to 48% and 50% for the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018. Materials costs represented 91% and 89% of product costs for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to 91% and 90% in the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018. 
Materials costs increased $31 million and $47 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to higher unit volumes of certain products.  
Margins on revenue recognized for strategic solutions were higher during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the benefit of high margins realized on the software license components of several ELAs, and, to a lesser extent, higher ASPs. Margins for mature products increased slightly in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year. 
Cost of software maintenance revenues in dollars was relatively flat in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018 and represented 3% of software maintenance revenues for both periods. 
Total compensation costs included in operating expenses increased by $5 million and $10 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, each representing an increase of 1%. Stock-based compensation expenses decreased slightly in the current year, while the other components of compensation costs increased slightly. Average headcount was relatively flat in each period. 
Compensation costs decreased for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, reflecting a 2% decrease in average headcount in each of the current year periods. Facilities and IT support costs decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to cost containment efforts. Commissions expense was relatively consistent in each of the respective comparative periods. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we announced a restructuring plan (the May 2018 Plan) to reduce costs and redirect resources to our highest return activities, which included a reduction in our global workforce of less than 2%. Charges related to the plan consisted primarily of employee severance-related costs. Substantially all activities under the plan have been completed. See Note 11 – Restructuring Charges of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. 
Interest income increased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to a shift in our investment portfolio to higher-yielding investments, partially offset by a decrease in the size of the portfolio. Interest expense declined in the current year periods due to a reduction in the average amount of interest-bearing debt outstanding. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 17.7% compared to an effective tax rate of 21.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Our effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was 7.3% compared to an effective tax rate of 16.9% for the corresponding period of fiscal 2018. Our effective tax rates reflect the impact of a significant amount of our earnings, primarily income from our European operations which are headquartered in the Netherlands, being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the U.S. statutory tax rate. Our effective tax rate decreased for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due the reduction of the federal income tax rate under U.S. tax reform and discrete impacts related to stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rate decreased for the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to the recognition of a $34 million discrete tax benefit for adjustments to certain intercompany transactions resulting from the retrospective application of the new revenue standard, increased discrete benefits for stock-based compensation, and the reduction in the federal income tax rate.  
Days sales outstanding, referred to as DSO, calculates the average collection period of our receivables. DSO is based on ending accounts receivable and net revenue for each period. DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable by average net revenue per day for the current quarter (91 days for each of the quarters presented above). DSO for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 due to one of our major distributors choosing not to take advantage of an early payment discount in the current quarter, while it decreased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 due to lower seasonal invoicing levels and more favorable shipping linearity. 
Days inventory outstanding, referred to as DIO, measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our products. DIO is based on ending inventory and cost of revenues for each period. DIO is calculated by dividing ending inventory by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter. DIO for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower levels of purchased components and finished goods, respectively, on hand at the end of the current quarter.  
Days payables outstanding, referred to as DPO, calculates the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment. DPO is based on ending accounts payable and cost of revenues for each period. DPO is calculated by dividing accounts payable by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter. DPO for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, due to differences in the timing of purchases from and payments to our suppliers. DPO for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to the timing of purchases from contract manufacturers. 
During the first six months of fiscal 2019, we generated cash from operating activities of $491 million, reflecting net income of $524 million, adjusted by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $98 million, and stock-based compensation of $78 million, compared to $564 million of cash generated from operating activities during the first six months of fiscal 2018.  
Accounts receivable decreased $269 million, reflecting lower DSO. 
Accrued expenses decreased $162 million, primarily due to employee compensation payouts related to fiscal year 2018 commissions and incentive compensation plans. 
Deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue decreased $129 million, primarily due to a decrease in deferred software and hardware maintenance contract revenues reflecting the seasonality of maintenance contract renewal activities. 
Long-term taxes payable decreased $63 million, primarily due to transition taxes associated with U.S. tax reform. 
During the first six months of fiscal 2019, we generated $489 million from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, and paid $107 million for capital expenditures, compared to $48 million and $65 million, respectively, during the first six months of fiscal 2018. 
Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt. Based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including potential future issuances of debt, equity or other securities, will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements. We cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all. 
Our principal sources of liquidity as of October 26, 2018 consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and our commercial paper program and related credit facility.  
Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary technologies, service interest and principal payments on our debt, fund our stock repurchase program, and pay dividends, as and if declared. 
The principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of October 26, 2018.  
Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. For further information on the underlying terms, see Note 8 – Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In connection with the Program, we have a senior unsecured credit agreement that expires on December 10, 2021. The credit agreement provides a $1.0 billion revolving unsecured credit facility that serves as a back-up for the Program. Proceeds from the facility may also be used for general corporate purposes, providing another potential source of liquidity to the extent that the credit facility exceeds the outstanding debt issued under the Program. The credit agreement also includes options that allow us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $300 million and to extend its maturity date for two additional one-year periods, both subject to certain conditions. As of October 26, 2018, we were in compliance with all associated covenants in this agreement. No amounts were drawn against this facility during any of the periods presented. 
On November 14, 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock, payable on January 23, 2019 to holders of record as of the close of business on January 4, 2019. 
Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. Under this program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Since the May 13, 2003 inception of this program through October 26, 2018, we repurchased a total of 298 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $35.87 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $10.7 billion. As of October 26, 2018, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was $2.9 billion. 
As of October 26, 2018, future annual minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year totaled $172 million.  
In the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. As of October 26, 2018, we had $422 million in non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory. We record a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.  
In addition to inventory commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and construction related obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services. As of October 26, 2018, we had $5 million in construction related obligations and $187 million in other purchase obligations.  
While most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers. We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize product revenues for these arrangements, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions, upon product acceptance. We sold $43 million and $49 million of receivables during the six months ended October 26, 2018 and October 27, 2017, respectively. 
Some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases, we recognize revenues in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, as updated to reflect the adoption of ASC 606. In connection with certain recourse financing arrangements, we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights. As of October 26, 2018 and April 28, 2017, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant. To date, we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements. 
We have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements. As of October 26, 2018, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote. The portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business. See further details on such matters in Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.  
In May 2003, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. As of October 26, 2018, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock. Since inception of the program through October 26, 2018, we repurchased a total of 298 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.7 billion. Under this program, which we may suspend or discontinue at any time, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management.
