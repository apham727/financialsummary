To provide visibility into our transition from older products to our newer, higher growth products and clarity into the dynamics of our product revenue, we have historically grouped our products by “Strategic” and “Mature” solutions.
Strategic solutions include Clustered ONTAP, branded E-Series, SolidFire, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure, enterprise software license agreements (ELAs) and other optional add-on software products.
Both our Mature and Strategic product lines include a mix of disk, hybrid and all flash storage media.
Revenues generated by our Cloud Data Services offerings are included in software maintenance revenues.
During the first six months of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 14 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $77.94 per share, for an aggregate of $1,061 million.
As of the beginning of fiscal 2019, we adopted the new accounting standard Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) using the full retrospective method of adoption.
Accordingly, our prior period condensed consolidated financial statements and supplementary data, as presented herein, have been restated to conform to the new rules.
As illustrated in Note 5 – Revenue of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the overall impact of adoption was not significant to prior periods.
However, application of the new rules to our ELAs resulted in approximately $20 million and $110 million of product revenues for such arrangements in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, that are incremental to the amounts we would have recognized under the old standard.
Under ASC 606, we recognize the software license fee component of our ELAs up-front, whereas under the prior rules the software license fee was recognized over the term of the ELA.
There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates as filed in such report, except with respect to revenue recognition as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Refer to Note 5 – Revenue of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details.
Our fiscal year is reported as a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April.
Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in April and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
Net revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 were $1,517 million and $2,991 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $102 million, or 7%, and $255 million, or 9%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, reflecting higher product revenues.
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the second quarter increased by half of one percentage point compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, and increased almost two percentage points in the first six months of fiscal 2019 when compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting higher margins on product revenues.
Gross profit margins on product revenues increased one and a half percentage points in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and four percentage points in the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting high margins on revenue recognized during the current year periods related to the software license components of several ELAs, and, to a lesser extent, higher average selling prices (ASPs).
Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2019 totaled $688 million, or 45% of net revenues and $1,378 million, or 46% of net revenues, respectively, representing a decrease of three percentage points and four percentage points when compared to the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, primarily due to higher net revenues in the current year periods.
The increase in net revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues of $94 million and $242 million, respectively.
Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased two percentage points and three percentage points in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018.
Product revenues from strategic solutions represented 71% of product revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to 69% in the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Product revenues from mature solutions represented 29% of product revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to 31% in the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled $649 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 15% increase from $566 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled $1,261 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 19% increase from $1,064 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
Contributing to these increases was over $20 million and $110 million of revenues from the software license component of several ELAs in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, which, under ASC 606, were recognized up-front.
Revenues generated from the sale of optional add-on software, unrelated to ELAs, also increased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Total product revenue from mature solutions totaled $264 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 4% increase from $253 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Total product revenue from mature solutions totaled $527 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019 reflecting a 9% increase from $482 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
These increases are primarily due to an increase in add-on hardware, storage and related OS revenues of 11% and 14% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of prior year.
Additionally, OEM revenues increased by 6% and 25% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year.
These increases were partially offset by our discontinuation of the 7-mode systems in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting the movement of customers to our newer products.
Software maintenance revenues are associated with contracts which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes and patch releases, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers.
The fluctuations in software maintenance revenues reflect fluctuations in the aggregate contract value of the installed base under software maintenance contracts, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts.
Hardware maintenance and other services revenues include hardware maintenance, professional services, and educational and training services revenues.
Hardware maintenance contract revenues were relatively flat year over year, at $303 million and $606 million, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to $306 million and $604 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Professional services and educational and training services revenues were $65 million and $132 million, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to $66 million and $139 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Americas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and U.S. public sector markets.
Cost of product revenues represented 47% and 46% of product revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to 48% and 50% for the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018.
Materials costs represented 91% and 89% of product costs for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to 91% and 90% in the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018.
Materials costs increased $31 million and $47 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to higher unit volumes of certain products.
Average unit materials costs for Clustered ONTAP systems increased by 12% and 13% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Margins on revenue recognized for strategic solutions were higher during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the benefit of high margins realized on the software license components of several ELAs, and, to a lesser extent, higher ASPs.
Margins for mature products increased slightly in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year.
Cost of software maintenance revenues in dollars was relatively flat in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018 and represented 3% of software maintenance revenues for both periods.
Costs represented 29% of hardware maintenance and other services revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to 30% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018.
Included in compensation costs are salaries, benefits, other compensation-related costs, stock-based compensation expense and employee incentive compensation plan costs.
Total compensation costs included in operating expenses increased by $5 million and $10 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, each representing an increase of 1%.
Stock-based compensation expenses decreased slightly in the current year, while the other components of compensation costs increased slightly.
Compensation costs decreased for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, reflecting a 2% decrease in average headcount in each of the current year periods.
Commissions expense was relatively consistent in each of the respective comparative periods.
The increase in compensation costs for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year was attributable to an increase in average headcount of 6% and 7%, respectively, resulting in higher salaries, benefits and incentive compensation expense, partially offset by slightly lower stock-based compensation expense.
The increase in headcount reflects our investment in additional engineering resources to support the expansion and enhancement of products and solutions targeted at our most important customer and market opportunities.
Development projects and outside services for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 increased as a result of higher spending on materials and services associated with engineering activities to develop new products and enhance existing ones.
Charges related to the plan consisted primarily of employee severance-related costs.
Substantially all activities under the plan have been completed.
See Note 11 – Restructuring Charges of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.
Interest income increased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to a shift in our investment portfolio to higher-yielding investments, partially offset by a decrease in the size of the portfolio.
Interest expense declined in the current year periods due to a reduction in the average amount of interest-bearing debt outstanding.
Our effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was 7.3% compared to an effective tax rate of 16.9% for the corresponding period of fiscal 2018.
Our effective tax rate decreased for the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to the recognition of a $34 million discrete tax benefit for adjustments to certain intercompany transactions resulting from the retrospective application of the new revenue standard, increased discrete benefits for stock-based compensation, and the reduction in the federal income tax rate.
As of October 26, 2018, we have not fully completed the accounting for the tax impacts of the TCJA.
No significant adjustments to prior period estimates or positions have been made in the current period.
The provisional amounts recorded are based on reasonable estimates and our current interpretation and understanding of the TCJA.
The Company is also still evaluating the effects of the TCJA’s global minimum tax on intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and has not yet made an accounting policy election to either account for the tax under a period cost method or a deferred method.
For the first six months ended October 26, 2018, we have accounted for the GILTI tax under a period cost method as we continue to evaluate potential impacts.
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, we will complete the accounting of the tax effects of the TCJA within the measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date.
As of October 26, 2018, we had $356 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits.
Working capital decreased by $1.3 billion to $2.2 billion as of October 26, 2018 compared to April 27, 2018 primarily due to the decreases in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments discussed above, and the reclassification of $400 million principal amount of our senior notes to current liabilities.
Days sales outstanding, referred to as DSO, calculates the average collection period of our receivables.
DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable by average net revenue per day for the current quarter (91 days for each of the quarters presented above).
DSO for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 due to one of our major distributors choosing not to take advantage of an early payment discount in the current quarter, while it decreased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 due to lower seasonal invoicing levels and more favorable shipping linearity.
Days inventory outstanding, referred to as DIO, measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our products.
DIO is calculated by dividing ending inventory by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter.
DIO for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower levels of purchased components and finished goods, respectively, on hand at the end of the current quarter.
Days payables outstanding, referred to as DPO, calculates the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment.
DPO is based on ending accounts payable and cost of revenues for each period.
DPO is calculated by dividing accounts payable by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter.
DPO for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, due to differences in the timing of purchases from and payments to our suppliers.
DPO for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to the timing of purchases from contract manufacturers.
During the first six months of fiscal 2019, we generated cash from operating activities of $491 million, reflecting net income of $524 million, adjusted by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $98 million, and stock-based compensation of $78 million, compared to $564 million of cash generated from operating activities during the first six months of fiscal 2018.
Accounts receivable decreased $269 million, reflecting lower DSO.
Accounts payable decreased $127 million, reflecting lower DPO.
Accrued expenses decreased $162 million, primarily due to employee compensation payouts related to fiscal year 2018 commissions and incentive compensation plans.
Deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue decreased $129 million, primarily due to a decrease in deferred software and hardware maintenance contract revenues reflecting the seasonality of maintenance contract renewal activities.
Long-term taxes payable decreased $63 million, primarily due to transition taxes associated with U.S. tax reform.
During the first six months of fiscal 2019, we generated $489 million from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, and paid $107 million for capital expenditures, compared to $48 million and $65 million, respectively, during the first six months of fiscal 2018.
Our principal sources of liquidity as of October 26, 2018 consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and our commercial paper program and related credit facility.
Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary technologies, service interest and principal payments on our debt, fund our stock repurchase program, and pay dividends, as and if declared.
We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible.
We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties.
We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed.
Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually.
For further information on the underlying terms, see Note 8 – Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have a commercial paper program (the Program), under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes.
Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $1.0 billion.
The maturities of the notes can vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue.
The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance.
As of October 26, 2018, we had commercial paper notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $250 million, a weighted-average interest rate of 2.45% and maturities ranging from 4 days to 31 days.
Proceeds from the facility may also be used for general corporate purposes, providing another potential source of liquidity to the extent that the credit facility exceeds the outstanding debt issued under the Program.
The credit agreement also includes options that allow us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $300 million and to extend its maturity date for two additional one-year periods, both subject to certain conditions.
We expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our commitments related to facilities, equipment, operating leases and internal-use software development projects over the next few years through existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations.
We anticipate capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal 2019 to be between $100 million and $150 million.
On November 14, 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock, payable on January 23, 2019 to holders of record as of the close of business on January 4, 2019.
Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.
Under this program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management.
The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
As of October 26, 2018, future annual minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year totaled $172 million.
In the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products.
As of October 26, 2018, we had $422 million in non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory.
In addition to inventory commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and construction related obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services.
As of October 26, 2018, we had $5 million in construction related obligations and $187 million in other purchase obligations.
While most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers.
We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables.
Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize product revenues for these arrangements, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions, upon product acceptance.
We sold $43 million and $49 million of receivables during the six months ended October 26, 2018 and October 27, 2017, respectively.
In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products.
These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users.
Some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions.
Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default.
These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets.
Where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases, we recognize revenues in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, as updated to reflect the adoption of ASC 606.
In connection with certain recourse financing arrangements, we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights.
As of October 26, 2018 and April 28, 2017, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant.
We have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements.
If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements.
As of October 26, 2018, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote.
We enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business.
These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance.
See further details on such matters in Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
In May 2003, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program.
As of October 26, 2018, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock.
Under this program, which we may suspend or discontinue at any time, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management.
