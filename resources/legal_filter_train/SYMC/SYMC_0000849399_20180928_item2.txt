•Net revenues decreased 5% primarily as a result of the divestiture of our website security (“WSS”) and public key infrastructure (“PKI”) solutions in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by an increase in revenue from our identity and information protection solutions.
•Operating income increased $111 million primarily due to increased revenue from our identity and information protection solutions, and lower stock-based compensation expense and restructuring, transition and other costs, partially offset by the absence in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 of operating income from our divested WSS and PKI solutions.

•Cash flow from operating activities increased $181 million due to a lower net loss, net of adjustments, and favorable net changes in operating assets and liabilities.
•Contract liabilities decreased $357 million compared to March 30, 2018, primarily due to a decrease of $169 million in March 30, 2018 balances as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, as well as lower billings versus recognized revenue during the first six months of fiscal 2019.
We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly.
Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates.
There have been no material changes in the matters for which we make critical accounting estimates in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements during the six months ended September 28, 2018, except for changes as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.
We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on contracts with customers.
Revenue recognition requirements are very complex and require us to make estimates and assumptions.
We enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which may include hardware, software licenses, cloud services, support and maintenance, and professional services.
We allocate revenue to each performance obligation on a relative fair value basis based on management’s estimate of stand-alone selling price (“SSP”).
Judgments are required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation.
Changes to the performance obligations in an arrangement, the judgments required to estimate the SSP for the respective performance obligations, and increasing variability in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition.

We have historically relied on cash generated from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of debt, and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs.
As of September 28, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.4 billion, of which $698 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed with the objective to preserve principal, maintain liquidity, and generate investment returns.
We also have an undrawn credit facility of $1.0 billion which expires in May 2021.
Our principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support on-going business activities, including the payment of taxes, fund capital expenditures, service existing debt, and invest in business acquisitions.
As a part of our plan to deleverage our balance sheet, we may from time to time make optional repayments of our debt obligations, which may include repurchases of our outstanding debt, depending on various factors such as market conditions.
Historically this has included a quarterly cash dividend, the repayment of debt and the repurchase of our common stock.
Our cash flows for the first six months of fiscal 2019 reflected a net loss of $68 million adjusted by non-cash items, including amortization and depreciation of $305 million, and stock-based compensation of $210 million.
Changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a decrease of $286 million in accounts receivable in the first six months of fiscal 2019, reflecting higher collections versus billings.
Our investing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2019 included capital expenditures of $95 million and payments for acquisitions of $17 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by cash proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments of $99 million, while our investing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2018 consisted of capital expenditures of $72 million and net cash payments of $361 million for acquisitions, primarily related to the acquisitions of Fireglass Ltd. and Skycure Ltd., and purchases of short-term investments of $201 million.
Our financing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of payment of dividends and dividend equivalents of $110 million and tax withholding payments related to RSUs of $53 million, compared to $114 million and $83 million, respectively, in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
In addition, we repaid debt of $2.0 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Debt - As of September 28, 2018, our total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness was $5.1 billion, of which $600 million in principal is payable in the next twelve months, summarized as follows.
The Senior Term Loan agreements A-2, A-5 and our revolving credit facility contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with specified financial ratios, non-financial covenants for financial reporting, and restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness, liens, stock repurchases and dividends (with exceptions permitting our regular quarterly dividend).
Our Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025 also require us to file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by specified deadlines.
As of September 28, 2018, we had not met the requirements in the Senior Term Loan agreements A-2, A-5, the revolving credit facility agreement, the Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025 to deliver audited financial statements for our fiscal year ended March 30, 2018 and file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for such period with the SEC.
In addition, we subsequently did not meet the requirements under the Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025 to file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for our fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2018 with the SEC by the specified deadline.
On October 26, 2018 we satisfied these requirements for our fiscal year ended March 30, 2018 by filing our Form 10-K for such period with the SEC.
The filing of our Form 10-K on October 26, 2018 and the simultaneous filing herewith of the Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended June 29, 2018 also satisfied our SEC reporting requirements for our year ended March 30, 2018 and our quarter ended June 29, 2018, respectively, under the Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025.
Because we expected as of September 28, 2018 that we would comply with all of our debt covenants before any applicable grace periods as defined in the associated indentures for the 5% Notes and the Convertible Senior Notes passed and waivers expired, we have classified all of the associated outstanding debt as long-term debt in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets except for the portion that is due in the twelve months following September 28, 2018.
Dividends.
On November 1, 2018, we announced a cash dividend of $0.075 per share of common stock to be paid in December 2018.
Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.
Stock repurchases.
Under our stock repurchase program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through open market and through accelerated stock repurchase transactions.
As of September 28, 2018, the remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization was $800 million and does not have an expiration date.
Therefore, $294 million in long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table.
