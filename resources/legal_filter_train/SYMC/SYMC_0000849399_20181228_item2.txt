•Net revenues were relatively flat compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, as increases in revenue from our identity and information protection solutions and from the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard were partially offset by a decrease as a result of the divestiture of our website security (“WSS”) and public key infrastructure (“PKI”) solutions in October 2017.

We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on contracts with customers. Revenue recognition requirements are very complex and require us to make estimates and assumptions.
We enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which may include hardware, software licenses, cloud services, support and maintenance, and professional services. We allocate revenue to each performance obligation on a relative fair value basis based on management’s estimate of stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). Judgments are required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation. The determination of SSP is made by taking into consideration observable prices in historical transactions. When observable prices in historical transactions are not available or are inconsistent, we estimate SSP based on observable prices in historical transactions of similar products, pricing discount practices, product margins, and other factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. Changes to the performance obligations in an arrangement, the judgments required to estimate the SSP for the respective performance obligations, and increasing variability in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition.
Percentages may not add due to rounding.

We have historically relied on cash generated from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of debt, and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs.
We also have an undrawn credit facility of $1.0 billion which expires in May 2021.
Our principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support on-going business activities, including the payment of taxes, fund capital expenditures, service existing debt, and invest in business acquisitions. As a part of our plan to deleverage our balance sheet, we may from time to time make optional repayments of our debt obligations, which may include repurchases of our outstanding debt, depending on various factors such as market conditions.
Our capital allocation strategy is to balance driving stockholder returns, managing financial risk, and preserving our flexibility to pursue strategic options, including acquisitions. Historically this has included a quarterly cash dividend, the repayment of debt and the repurchase of our common stock.
Our cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 reflected a net loss of $3 million adjusted by non-cash items, including amortization and depreciation of $457 million, and stock-based compensation of $265 million, compared to a net income of $1.2 billion adjusted by non-cash items, including amortization and depreciation of $485 million, and stock-based compensation of $448 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018.

In addition, we repaid debt of $2.6 billion and received net proceeds from sales of common stock under employee stock incentive plans of $83 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Debt - As of December 28, 2018, our total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness was $5.1 billion, of which $600 million in principal is payable in the next twelve months, summarized as follows. See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our debt. 
Prior to the end of fiscal 2019, we plan to prepay our $600 million Senior Term Loan A-2 due August 1, 2019.
Debt covenant compliance. The Senior Term Loan agreements A-2, A-5 and our revolving credit facility contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with specified financial ratios, non-financial covenants for financial reporting, and restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness, liens, stock repurchases and dividends (with exceptions permitting our regular quarterly dividend). Our Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025 also require us to file periodic reports with the SEC by specified deadlines. As of December 28, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.
Dividends. On January 31, 2019, we announced a cash dividend of $0.075 per share of common stock to be paid in March 2019. Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. 
Stock repurchases. Under our stock repurchase program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through accelerated stock repurchase transactions, open market transactions (including through trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act) and privately-negotiated transactions. As of December 28, 2018, the remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization was $800 million. In January 2019, our Board of Directors approved an increase or $500 million to our program, resulting in aggregate authorization of $1.3 billion with no fixed expiration date. We plan to initiate stock repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities.
