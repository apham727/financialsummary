Item 1A. Risk Factors
•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the merger.
The exchange ratio will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either the Company or Engility stock price.
The price of SAIC common shares at the closing of the merger may vary from the price on the date the Merger Agreement was executed and the dates of the respective special meetings of our stockholders and Engility’s stockholders. As a result, the market value of the merger consideration may also vary. 
We and Engility will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the Merger. 
We may not obtain sufficient financing to repay certain outstanding obligations of Engility upon closing.
We have entered into a debt commitment letter pursuant to which Citigroup Global Markets Inc. has committed to provide us with a new seven-year senior secured $1.05 billion Term Loan B structured as an incremental facility under our existing credit agreement. The proceeds of this new financing are necessary to enable us to repay Engility’s existing credit facility and outstanding notes. Citibank’s obligation to provide us financing under the debt commitment letter, however, is subject to specified limited conditions, and we cannot assure you that these conditions will be met. The closing of the merger is not conditioned on our ability to obtain financing. If we are unable to obtain financing pursuant to the debt commitment letter or otherwise, we still could be required to close the merger resulting in a default under our and Engility’s existing credit agreements, or we could be subject to claims under the Merger Agreement, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Purchases of Equity Securities. We may repurchase shares on the open market in accordance with established repurchase plans. Whether repurchases are made and the timing and amount of repurchases depend on a variety of factors including market conditions, our capital position, internal cash generation and other factors. We also repurchase shares in connection with stock option and stock award activities to satisfy tax withholding obligations.
