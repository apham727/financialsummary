We use the terms "SAIC," the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” to refer to Science Applications International Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We are a leading technology integrator providing full life-cycle services and solutions in the technical, engineering and enterprise information technology (IT) markets.
We developed our brand by addressing our customers’ mission critical needs and solving their most complex problems for over 45 years.
As one of the largest pure-play technical service providers to the U.S. government, we serve markets of significant scale and opportunity.
Our primary customers are the departments and agencies of the U.S. government.
We serve our customers through approximately 1,300 active contracts and task orders and employ more than 15,000 individuals who are led by an experienced executive team of proven industry leaders.
Our long history of serving the U.S. government has afforded us the ability to develop strong and longstanding relationships with some of the largest customers in the markets we serve.
Substantially all of our revenues and tangible long-lived assets are generated by or owned by entities located in the United States.
On September 9, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement by and among SAIC, Engility Holdings, Inc. ("Engility"), and Raptors Merger Sub, Inc., pursuant to which we will acquire Engility (the “Merger”).
In connection with the Merger, the Company has obtained a commitment letter from Citigroup Global Markets Inc. for a new seven-year senior secured $1.05 billion term loan facility under our existing credit agreement.
The proceeds will be used to repay Engility’s existing credit facility and outstanding notes.
The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval of both SAIC and Engility stockholders and clearance under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending and the alignment of our offerings and capabilities with the budget priorities of the U.S. government.
A budget agreement passed in February would extend and increase those spending levels for GFY 2019.
But beyond that two-year window, there remains uncertainty on whether, and by how much, discretionary spending will be increased above the budget caps put in place in August 2011.
Without additional action, federal expenditures would decline sharply in GFY 2020.
Some changes that could have an adverse impact on our business include the implementation of future spending reductions (including sequestration), government shutdowns and issues related to required increases to the nation’s debt ceiling (under current law, the debt ceiling will be reached in March 2019).
The U.S. government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a competitive bidding process (including indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) schedules and other multi-award contracts) which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure.
We expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process.
Despite the budget and competitive pressures impacting the industry, we believe we are well positioned to protect and expand existing customer relationships and benefit from opportunities that we have not previously pursued.
We believe our long-term, trusted customer relationships and deep technical expertise provide us with the sophistication to handle highly complex mission-critical contracts.
SAIC’s value proposition is found in the proven ability to serve as a trusted adviser to our customers.
In doing so, we leverage our expertise and scale to help them execute their mission.
Our solutions, inspired through innovation, are based on best practices and technology transfer.
Our past performance was achieved by employee dedication and customer focus.
During fiscal 2018, the Company initiated restructuring activities (the "Restructuring") intended to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and better position the Company to drive future growth.
Management's restructuring activities included involuntary and voluntary terminations and the consolidation of existing leased facilities.
Refer to "Results of Operations" below, and "Restructuring" in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
•return of capital in excess of operating needs.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure described in more detail in “Non-GAAP Measures” below.
Our business and program management process is directed by professional managers focused on satisfying our customers by providing high quality services in achieving program requirements.
These managers carefully monitor performance by constantly evaluating risks and opportunities.
Through each program life cycle, managers review performance and update estimates to reflect their understanding of the best information available.
For performance obligations satisfied over time, updates to estimates are recognized on inception-to-date activity, during the period of adjustment, resulting in either a favorable or unfavorable impact to operating income.
We also analyze our cost mix (labor, subcontractor or materials) in order to understand operating margin because programs with a higher proportion of SAIC labor are generally more profitable.
Revenues.
Revenues increased $37 million or 3.4% for the three months ended August 3, 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year due to increased orders in our supply chain portfolio ($31 million) and revenue on new contracts primarily supporting NASA and other federal civilian agencies ($24 million).
These increases were partially offset by completion of contracts and other net decreases across our portfolio ($18 million).
Revenues increased $109 million or 5.0% for the six months ended August 3, 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year due to revenue on new contracts primarily supporting NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ($71 million) and increased orders in our supply chain portfolio ($95 million).
These increases were partially offset by completion of contracts and other net decreases across our portfolio ($57 million).
Cost of Revenues.
Cost of revenues increased $24 million for the three months ended August 3, 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenue volume.
Cost of revenues increased $91 million for the six months ended August 3, 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in revenue volume.
Operating Income.
Operating income as a percentage of revenues increased to 6.6% for the three months ended August 3, 2018 from 5.5% in the comparable prior year period, driven by improved performance across our portfolio and the realization of cost efficiencies resulting from our restructuring activities in fiscal 2018.
Operating income as a percentage of revenues increased to 6.1% for the six months ended August 3, 2018 from 5.6% in the comparable prior year period primarily due to improved performance across our portfolio and the realization of cost efficiencies resulting from our restructuring activities in fiscal 2018.
Net Income.
Net income for the six months ended August 3, 2018 increased $13 million as compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher operating income, partially offset by higher income tax expense.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $76 million for the six months ended August 3, 2018, an increase of $23 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher customer collections, partially offset by an increase in working capital investments in platform integration programs.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that is calculated by taking net income and excluding interest, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking EBITDA and excluding restructuring costs that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
The restructuring costs excluded relate to the Company's plan in fiscal 2018 to restructure certain aspects of its operations and is the only significant restructuring since we began operating as an independent company almost five years ago.
While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating our financial information, it should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Other companies may define similar measures differently.
Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended August 3, 2018 increased to 7.5% of revenues from 6.7% of revenues for the prior year, driven by improved performance across our portfolio and the realization of cost efficiencies resulting from our restructuring activities in fiscal 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended August 3, 2018 increased to 7.0% of revenues from 6.6% of revenues for the prior year, driven by improved performance across our portfolio and the realization of cost efficiencies resulting from our restructuring activities in fiscal 2018.
Net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenues to be earned in the future from funded and negotiated unfunded contract awards that were received during the period, net of adjustments to estimates on previously awarded contracts.
We calculate net bookings as the period’s ending backlog plus the period’s revenues less the prior period’s ending backlog and initial backlog obtained through acquisitions.
Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed.
We do not include in backlog estimates of revenues to be derived from IDIQ contracts, but rather record backlog and bookings when task orders are awarded on these contracts.
Given that much of our revenue is derived from IDIQ contract task orders that renew annually, bookings on these contracts tend to refresh annually as the task orders are renewed.
Additionally, we do not include in backlog contract awards that are under protest until the protest is resolved in our favor.
•Funded Backlog.
Funded backlog for contracts with government agencies primarily represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts.
It does not include the unfunded portion of contracts in which funding is incrementally appropriated or authorized on a quarterly or annual basis by the U.S. government and other customers even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years.
Funded backlog for contracts with non-government customers represents the estimated value on contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which we are obligated to perform, less revenues previously recognized on these contracts.
Negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from negotiated contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized and from unexercised priced contract options.
Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include any estimate of future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA Schedules or other master agreement contract vehicles.
We expect to recognize revenue from a substantial portion of our funded backlog within the next twelve months.
However, the U.S. government can adjust the scope of services of or cancel contracts at any time.
Similarly, certain contracts with commercial customers include provisions that allow the customer to cancel prior to contract completion.
We had net bookings worth an estimated $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion during the three and six months ended August 3, 2018, respectively.
Total backlog at the end of the second quarter is consistent with our total backlog at prior year end.
Our contract mix for the six months ended August 3, 2018 reflects an increase in cost reimbursement type contracts due to newly awarded contracts supporting federal civilian agencies and a change in contract type on a significant contract supporting the Department of Defense.
Cost of revenues mix for the three and six months ended August 3, 2018 reflects an increase in supply chain material content.
As a services provider, our business generally requires minimal infrastructure investment.
We expect to fund our ongoing working capital, commitments and any other discretionary investments with cash on hand, future operating cash flows and, if needed, borrowings under our $200 million Revolving Credit Facility.
We anticipate that our future cash needs will be for working capital, capital expenditures, and contractual and other commitments.
We consider various financial measures when we develop and update our capital deployment strategy, which includes evaluating cash provided by operating activities, free cash flow and financial leverage.
When our cash generation enables us to exceed our target average minimum cash balance of $150 million, we intend to deploy excess cash through dividends, share repurchases, debt prepayments or strategic acquisitions.
Nevertheless, we believe that our existing cash on hand, generation of future operating cash flows, and access to bank financing and capital markets will provide adequate resources to meet our short-term liquidity and long-term capital needs.
Refer to “Results of Operations” above for a discussion of the changes in cash provided by operating activities between the six months ended August 3, 2018 and the comparable prior year period.
No plan share repurchases were made during the quarter as we evaluated alternative capital deployment opportunities, including the pending acquisition of Engility.
We have entered into contracts with various vendors for long-lead time materials that will be necessary to complete the low-rate initial production (LRIP) phase of our Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) contract with the United States Marine Corps.
In order to meet our anticipated commitments for the LRIP phase we committed to purchasing these materials, including materials required to complete a portion of the LRIP phase which we had not yet been awarded.
Our total commitment on the portion of the LRIP phase which has not yet been awarded is approximately $42 million as of August 3, 2018, of which we have made $6 million in total payments, which is included in inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets on our condensed and consolidated balance sheets.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on August 27, 2018, we received a stop-work order from the Marine Corps.
The stop-work order suspends performance on portions of the LRIP phase for a period of 90 days while the Marine Corps evaluates the AAV program to determine if it will continue, in full or in part, or be canceled.
Other than this update, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as reported in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.
Typically, the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and complex have to do with making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Revenue Recognition.
We generate our revenues primarily from long-term contracts in which we provide technical, engineering and enterprise IT services directly for the U.S. government and as a subcontractor with other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government.
We evaluate the nature of the contract and the services provided when determining the accounting method utilized for each contract.
We provide for anticipated losses on long-term production type contracts and service contracts with the U.S. government by recording an expense for the total expected contract loss during the period when the loss is determined.
Contract costs incurred for U.S. government contracts (including allocated indirect costs) are subject to audit and adjustment through negotiations with government representatives.
Revenues on U.S. government contracts have been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized on final settlement.
Many of our contracts include forms of variable consideration such as reimbursable costs, award and incentive fees, usage-based pricing, service-level penalties, performance bonuses, and other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price.
At contract inception, we estimate the transaction price and may include variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.
Other than the item described above, there have been no changes to our existing critical accounting policies during the six months ended August 3, 2018 from those disclosed in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For information on recently issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of the notes to the condensed and consolidated financial statements contained within this report.
Purchases of Equity Securities.
We may repurchase shares on the open market in accordance with established repurchase plans.
We also repurchase shares in connection with stock option and stock award activities to satisfy tax withholding obligations.
