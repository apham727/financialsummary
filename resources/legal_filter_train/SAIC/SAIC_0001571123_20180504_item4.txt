Item 4.
During the assessment process at February 2, 2018, we identified deficiencies in the operating effectiveness of controls over the training and awareness of contractual requirements related to multi-customer funding and the design of program control and time sheet review controls over contracts with multi-customer funding sources.
Our management is implementing its plan to remediate the material weakness described above.
Remediation efforts include improving the design of program control and time sheet review controls over contracts with multi-customer funding sources and increased training and awareness in the administration of such contracts.
We expect to complete the remediation of the material weakness in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
