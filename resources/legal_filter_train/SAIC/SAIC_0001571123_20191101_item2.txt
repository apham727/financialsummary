We use the terms "SAIC," the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” to refer to Science Applications International Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We are a leading technology integrator providing full life cycle services and solutions in the technical, engineering and enterprise information technology (IT) markets.
We developed our brand by addressing our customers’ mission critical needs and solving their most complex problems for over 50 years.
As one of the largest pure-play technical service providers to the U.S. government, we serve markets of significant scale and opportunity.
Our primary customers are the departments and agencies of the U.S. government.
We serve our customers through approximately 2,200 active contracts and task orders and employ more than 23,000 individuals who are led by an experienced executive team of proven industry leaders.
Our long history of serving the U.S. government has afforded us the ability to develop strong and longstanding relationships with some of the largest customers in the markets we serve.
In fiscal year 2019, we generated greater than 95% of our revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, including subcontracts on which we perform.
Our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending and the alignment of our offerings and capabilities with the budget priorities of the U.S. government.
These bills were funded at increased levels for defense and non-defense spending based on a bi-partisan agreement reached in February 2018 to lift caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), providing additional business opportunities for the Company.
In July 2019, Congress passed, and the President signed, legislation that would increase the caps for GFY 2020 and GFY 2021 by a total of $323 billion.
The cap increases also were paired with an extension of the federal debt limit until July 31, 2021, postponing the threat of a federal government default.
There remains a possibility that political and policy disputes could result in a full or partial government shutdown later this year.
In addition to the ongoing threat of shutdowns, future Congresses could choose to reduce overall spending levels or fail to increase the federal debt limit.
The U.S. government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a competitive bidding process (including indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) schedules, and other multi-award contracts), which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure.
We expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process.
We believe our long-term, trusted customer relationships and deep technical expertise provide us with the sophistication to handle highly complex, mission-critical contracts.
SAIC’s value proposition is found in the proven ability to serve as a trusted adviser to our customers.
In doing so, we leverage our expertise and scale to help them execute their mission.
Our solutions are inspired through innovation based on adoption of best practices and technology integration of the best capabilities available.
Our past performance was achieved by employees dedicated to supporting our customers’ most challenging missions.
Our business and program management process is directed by professional managers focused on satisfying our customers by providing high quality services in achieving program requirements.
These managers carefully monitor contract margin performance by constantly evaluating contract risks and opportunities.
Through each contract's life cycle, program managers review performance and update contract performance estimates to reflect their understanding of the best information available.
For performance obligations satisfied over time, updates to estimates are recognized on inception-to-date activity, during the period of adjustment, resulting in either a favorable or unfavorable impact to operating income.
We also analyze our cost mix (labor, subcontractor or materials) in order to understand operating margin because programs with a higher proportion of SAIC labor are generally more profitable.
Revenues.
Revenues increased $453 million or 38.5% for the three months ended November 1, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year due to the acquisition of Engility.
Adjusting for the impact of acquired revenues, revenues contracted 1.5% due to acquisition related dis-synergies.
Revenues increased $1,372 million or 39.6% for the nine months ended November 1, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year due to the acquisition of Engility.
Adjusting for the impact of acquired revenues, revenues contracted 1.4%, primarily attributable to the completion of certain contracts with the U.S. Marine Corps ($69 million) and the effect of acquisition related dis-synergies.
Cost of Revenues.
Cost of revenues increased $408 million for the three months ended November 1, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Engility.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased from 89.0% in the prior year quarter to 89.3%, due to lower current quarter net profit write-ups, partially offset by the acquisition of Engility.
Cost of revenues increased $1,175 million for the nine months ended November 1, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Engility.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased from 90.1% in the prior year to 88.9%, due to higher labor content partially driven by the Engility acquisition.
Operating Income.
Operating income as a percentage of revenues of 5.8% for the three months ended November 1, 2019 decreased from 6.2% in the comparable prior year period due to increased intangible asset amortization, lower current quarter net profit write-ups and acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by cost synergies.
Operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 5.8% for the nine months ended November 1, 2019 from 6.1% in the comparable prior year period primarily due to increased intangible asset amortization and acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by cost synergies.
Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders.
Net income attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended November 1, 2019 increased $7 million as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased operating income ($17 million, net of tax), partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.
Net income attributable to common stockholders for the nine months ended November 1, 2019 increased $21 million as compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher operating income ($57 million, net of tax), partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $389 million for the nine months ended November 1, 2019, an increase of $227 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to cash provided from the operating activities of Engility, strong customer collections across several programs, and customer collections recouped from the U.S. federal government partial shutdown that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that is calculated by taking net income and excluding interest, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking EBITDA and excluding acquisition and integration costs that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
The acquisition and integration costs relate to the Company's significant acquisition of Engility.
Other companies may define similar measures differently.
Cost synergies related to the acquisition were offset by lower net profit write-ups.
Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended November 1, 2019 increased to 8.3% of revenues from 7.4% of revenues for the prior year, driven by the acquisition of Engility and cost synergies related to the acquisition.
Net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenues to be earned in the future from funded and negotiated unfunded contract awards that were received during the period, net of adjustments to estimates on previously awarded contracts.
We calculate net bookings as the period’s ending backlog plus the period’s revenues less the prior period’s ending backlog and initial backlog obtained through acquisitions.
Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed.
We do not include in backlog estimates of revenues to be derived from IDIQ contracts, but rather record backlog and bookings when task orders are awarded on these contracts.
Given that much of our revenue is derived from IDIQ contract task orders that renew annually, bookings on these contracts tend to refresh annually as the task orders are renewed.
Additionally, we do not include in backlog contract awards that are under protest until the protest is resolved in our favor.
•Funded Backlog.
Funded backlog for contracts with government agencies primarily represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts.
It does not include the unfunded portion of contracts in which funding is incrementally appropriated or authorized on a quarterly or annual basis by the U.S. government and other customers even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years.
Funded backlog for contracts with non-government customers represents the estimated value on contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which we are obligated to perform, less revenues previously recognized on these contracts.
Negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from negotiated contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized and from unexercised priced contract options.
Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include any estimate of future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA Schedules or other master agreement contract vehicles.
We expect to recognize revenue from a substantial portion of our funded backlog within the next twelve months.
However, the U.S. government can adjust the scope of services of or cancel contracts at any time.
Similarly, certain contracts with commercial customers include provisions that allow the customer to cancel prior to contract completion.
We had net bookings worth an estimated $2.2 billion and $5.5 billion during the three and nine months ended November 1, 2019.
Total backlog at the end of the third quarter has increased compared to total backlog at prior year end due to several large awards received during the period from classified customers in the intelligence community, NASA, and other various federal government customers, as well as increased funding on existing contracts.
Our contract mix for the nine months ended November 1, 2019 reflects an increase in cost reimbursement type contracts due the acquisition of Engility, which historically had a higher proportion of cost reimbursement type contracts, and a change in contract type on a significant contract supporting the Department of Defense.
Cost of revenues mix for the three and nine months ended November 1, 2019 reflects an increase in labor-related content primarily due to the acquisition of Engility, which historically had a higher proportion of such costs.
As a services provider, our business generally requires minimal infrastructure investment.
We expect to fund our ongoing working capital, commitments and any other discretionary investments with cash on hand, future operating cash flows and, if needed, borrowings under our $400 million Revolving Credit Facility.
We anticipate that our future cash needs will be for working capital, capital expenditures, and contractual and other commitments.
We consider various financial measures when we develop and update our capital deployment strategy, which includes evaluating cash provided by operating activities, free cash flow and financial leverage.
When our cash generation enables us to exceed our target average minimum cash balance, we intend to deploy excess cash through dividends, share repurchases, debt prepayments or strategic acquisitions.
Nevertheless, we believe that our existing cash on hand, generation of future operating cash flows, and access to bank financing and capital markets will provide adequate resources to meet our short-term liquidity and long-term capital needs.
Refer to “Results of Operations” above for a discussion of the changes in cash provided by operating activities between the nine months ended November 1, 2019 and the comparable prior year period.
Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended November 1, 2019 increased compared to the prior year period due to purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by lower capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment.
Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.
Typically, the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and complex have to do with making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
There have been no changes to our existing critical accounting policies, other than our accounting policy on leases, during the nine months ended November 1, 2019 from those disclosed in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. We revised our accounting policy on leases in conjunction with our adoption of Accounting Standards Update No.

Purchases of Equity Securities.
We may repurchase shares on the open market in accordance with established repurchase plans.
We also repurchase shares in connection with stock option and stock award activities to satisfy tax withholding obligations.
