Throughout this document, references to “we,” “our,” the “Company,” and “Xerox” refer to Xerox Corporation and its subsidiaries.
We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate.
This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency.
We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency.
Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
Total revenue of $2.21 billion for first quarter 2019 declined 9.4% from first quarter 2018, including a 2.4-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.
The declines in Post sale revenues were larger in the U.S. where we recently implemented organizational changes as part of our Project Own It transformation actions.
The increase in Net income attributable to Xerox for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year period, was primarily due to the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from our Project Own It transformation actions, which offset the impact of lower revenues, as well as lower Transaction and related costs, net, lower Income tax expense and higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates.
These benefits were partially offset by higher Restructuring and related costs.
The increase in adjusted1 net income attributable to Xerox for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year period was primarily related to increased operating profits reflecting the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements, which offset the decline in revenues, as well as higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates.
Cash flows provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $226 million, as compared to $216 million in first quarter 2018.

•High-end - For the three months ended March 31, 2019, revenue was nearly flat, as compared to first quarter 2018, and was driven by lower sales from our Americas sales organization, mostly offset by growth from our European region.
The decline in installs was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix driven by strong demand for the higher-configuration models of our Iridesse production press.
While the rate of our first quarter 2019 revenue decline was greater than the rate we expect for the year as a whole (largely due to the impact of organizational changes implemented in the first quarter 2019), we expect such decline to improve each quarter sequentially on a year-over-year basis, resulting in an overall revenue decline of about 5% for the year as a whole, excluding an approximate 1.0-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.

We are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet.
As permitted, certain of these derivative contracts have been designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Certain of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are effective as economic hedges.

The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange and interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged.
