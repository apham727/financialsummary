Item 2.
This report and other documents we have filed with the SEC contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections.
We caution readers not to place undue reliance upon any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.
In this document, the words “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer only to Skyworks Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries and not any other person or entity.
We, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, are empowering the wireless networking revolution.
Our highly innovative analog semiconductors are connecting people, places, and things spanning a number of new and previously unimagined applications within the automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets.
This increase in revenue was primarily driven by our success in capturing a higher share of the increasing radio frequency and analog content per device as smartphone models continue to evolve, the increasing number of applications for the Internet of Things, and our expanding analog product portfolio supporting new vertical markets including automotive, industrial, medical and military.
•Our ending cash and cash equivalents balance increased approximately 4% to $1,682 million as of December 29, 2017, from $1,617 million as of September 29, 2017.
This increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of cash generated from operations of $361 million, partially offset by the repurchase of 1.65 million shares of common stock for $173 million, dividend payments of $59 million, and capital expenditures of $28 million during the three months ended December 29, 2017.
We market and sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers of communications and electronics products, third-party original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers, and indirectly through electronic components distributors.
We generally experience seasonal peaks during the second half of the calendar year, primarily as a result of increased worldwide production of consumer electronics in anticipation of increased holiday sales, whereas our second fiscal quarter is typically lower and in line with seasonal industry trends.
We generated net revenue of $1,051.9 million for the three months ended December 29, 2017, an increase of $137.6 million or 15%, as compared with $914.3 million for the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017.
This increase in net revenue for the three months ended December 29, 2017, is primarily related to an increase in demand for our components from a key smartphone customer as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, partially offset by decreases in average selling prices.
Gross profit represents net revenue less cost of goods sold.
Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials, labor and overhead (including depreciation and share-based compensation expense) associated with product manufacturing.
Erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry.
The $72.9 million increase in gross profit for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, was primarily the result of favorable product mix and higher unit volumes that positively impacted gross profit by $81.2 million.
Gross profit margin increased to 51.0% of net revenue for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, due to the overall increase in revenue and the aforementioned factors.
The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, was primarily related to an increase in employee-related compensation expense and product development– related expenses.
Research and development expense increased as a percentage of net revenue when compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017 as a result of our increased investment in developing new product capabilities.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, was primarily related to an increase in employee compensation.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue when compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to the increase in net revenue.
The decrease in amortization expense for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, was primarily due to the end of the useful lives of certain intangible assets that were acquired in prior fiscal years.
The new law makes fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational entities, including a shift from worldwide taxation with deferral to a hybrid territorial system, featuring a participation exemption regime, a minimum tax on low-taxed foreign earnings, and new measures to deter base erosion and promote export from the United States.
Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”), provides a measurement period during which companies may analyze the impacts of newly enacted legislation when the company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the new legislation, not to exceed one year.
We believe these amounts are reasonable estimates; however these amounts are provisional and are subject to change.
Additional time is needed to gather the information necessary to finalize the computations of the impact of the new tax legislation.
The changes included in the new tax legislation are broad and complex.
SAB 118 would allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the new tax legislation to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts.
We currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the end of our current fiscal year ending September 28, 2018.
During the three months ended December 29, 2017, we generated $360.8 million of cash from operating activities, a decrease of $135.1 million as compared with the $495.9 million generated during the three months ended December 30, 2016.
The decrease in cash flow from operating activities during the three months ended December 29, 2017, was primarily related to a net change in cash outflows of $156.3 million related to a decrease in accounts payable as a result of the timing of vendor payments.
Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired, capital expenditures, cash received from the sale of capital assets, and cash related to the sale or maturity of investments.
Cash used in investing activities was $34.2 million during the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared with $60.6 million during the three months ended December 30, 2016.
During the three months ended December 29, 2017, we paid $6.0 million related to purchased intangibles.
•$172.5 million related to our repurchase of 1.65 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on January 17, 2017;
•$59.1 million related to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock; and
•$44.7 million related to the minimum statutory payroll tax withholdings payments on the vesting of employee performance and restricted stock awards.
These uses of cash were partially offset by the net proceeds from employee stock option exercises of $14.4 million during the three months ended December 29, 2017.
Cash and cash equivalent balances were $1,681.5 million as of December 29, 2017, representing an increase of $64.7 million from September 29, 2017.
The increase resulted from $360.8 million in cash generated from operations which was partially offset by $172.5 million used to repurchase 1.65 million shares of stock, $59.1 million in cash dividend payments, $44.7 million used to repurchase shares related to payroll tax withholdings on equity awards, and $28.2 million in capital expenditures.
However, we cannot be certain that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements.
Our invested cash balances primarily consist of highly liquid term deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less and money market funds where the underlying securities primarily consist of United States treasury obligations, United States agency obligations and repurchase agreements collateralized by United States government and agency obligations.
Our cash and cash equivalent balance of $1,681.5 million as of December 29, 2017, consisted of $742.0 million held domestically and $939.5 million held by foreign subsidiaries.
On January 31, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock from time to time prior to January 31, 2020, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements.
This newly authorized stock repurchase plan replaces in its entirety the aforementioned January 17, 2017 plan.
The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
We currently expect to fund the repurchase program using our working capital.
Our contractual obligations disclosure in the 2017 10-K has not materially changed since we filed that report, except for the $257.8 million deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, which is payable over the next eight years, $20.6 million per year for each of the next five years, followed by payments of $38.7 million, $51.6 million and $64.5 million in years six through eight, respectively.
Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
On November 15, 2017, we agreed to potentially issue not more than 1% of our common stock to an unaffiliated third party as contingent consideration for its role under a multi-year collaboration agreement.
The shares are issuable for no cash payment but only upon the achievement of certain product sale milestones, certain terminations of the agreement or if the Company engages in certain competition with the third party.
Though the timing is not certain, the Company does not expect achievement of the product sale milestones to occur any time prior to mid-2020.
The transaction was made in reliance on the exemption from registration in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
The Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the resale of any issued shares.
On January 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Company’s Board of Directors amended the Company’s Fiscal Year 2018 Executive Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) to provide that the portion of the incentive awards under the Incentive Plan that previously was attainable based on the Company’s achievement against a non-GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”) performance metric will instead be attainable based on the Company’s achievement against a non-GAAP operating income performance metric.
The non-GAAP operating income performance metric was established by the Compensation Committee on November 7, 2017, concurrently with the non-GAAP EPS performance metric.
The Compensation Committee approved the change in metrics in light of the favorable impact on the Company’s non-GAAP EPS for fiscal year 2018 that is now expected as a result of the new U.S. tax legislation, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, as well as the potential favorable impact on non-GAAP EPS of the Company’s new stock repurchase program.
No other changes were made to the Incentive Plan.
Effective January 31, 2018, the Board of Directors approved and adopted an amendment to our Third Amended and Restated By-laws (the “By-laws”) to grant stockholders the right to call a special meeting of stockholders.
Prior to the adoption of this provision, a special meeting of stockholders could only be called pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors.
Article II, Section 3 of the By-laws has been amended to permit stockholders who, individually or in the aggregate, own at least 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock and who have held such shares continuously for at least one year prior to their request, to call a special meeting of stockholders, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the By-laws.
This description of the amendment to the By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the By-laws, as amended, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
