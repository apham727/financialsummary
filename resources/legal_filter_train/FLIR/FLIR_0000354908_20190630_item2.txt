The “Segment Operating Results” section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated revenue and earnings from operations.
While the backlog is subject to order cancellations, we have not historically experienced a significant amount of order cancellations.
Revenue.
Consolidated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019, increased by 6.5 percent year over year, from $452.7 million in the second quarter of 2018 to $482.0 million in the second quarter of 2019.
Consolidated revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased by 3.9 percent year over year, from $892.3 million in the first six months of 2018 to $926.7 million in the first six months of 2019.
Increases in revenues for the three month period was primarily driven by increases in our Government and Defense business unit which is partially attributed to the acquisitions of Aeryon Labs Inc. ("Aeryon") and Endeavor Robotics Holdings Inc. ("Endeavor") during the first quarter of 2019 coupled with volume increases of unmanned solutions and surveillance systems.
Increases in revenues for the sixth month period were primarily driven by increases in our Government and Defense business unit as noted above, partially offset by declines in our Commercial business unit as a result of the divestiture of the Consumer and Small and Medium-sized ("SMB") Security businesses as announced in February 2018 and volume declines in the Maritime and Outdoor and Tactical Systems ("OTS") businesses.
Consequently, year over year comparisons for any given quarter may not be indicative of comparisons using longer time periods.
International sales accounted for 44.2 percent and 48.4 percent of total revenue for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Overall, we anticipate that revenue from international sales will continue to comprise a significant percentage of total revenue.
Cost of goods sold.
Cost of goods sold for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $248.4 million and $459.5 million compared to cost of goods sold for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 of $220.2 million and $441.9 million.
The increase in cost of goods sold for the three month period is partially attributed to the acquisitions of Aeryon and Endeavor coupled with volume increases of unmanned solutions and surveillance systems.
month period is primarily driven by the Government and Defense business unit for the same reasons noted for the three month period, partially offset by declines in our Commercial business unit as a result of the divestiture of the Consumer and SMB Security businesses in the first quarter of 2018 and volume declines in the Maritime and OTS businesses.
Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, was $233.6 million compared to $232.6 million for the same quarter last year.
Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $467.3 million compared to $450.5 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2018.
Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, decreased from 51.4 percent in the second quarter of 2018 to 48.5 percent in the second quarter of 2019 and remained flat at 50.4 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 50.5 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Research and development expenses.
Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2019 totaled $53.0 million, compared to $46.4 million in the second quarter of 2018.
Research and development expenses for the first six months of 2019 were $101.0 million compared to $91.0 million for the first six months of 2018.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were 11.0 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 10.3 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue for the first six months of 2019 were 10.9 percent and 10.2 percent during the first six months of 2018.
Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2018, our annual research and development expenses have varied between 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent of revenue, and we currently expect these expenses to remain within that approximate range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $116.9 million and $97.5 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $221.4 million and $205.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expense during the first six months in 2019 compared to the first six months in 2018 is primarily attributed to acquisition related expenses for acquisitions occurring in the first half of 2019 and consent agreement related costs partially offset by the $15 million regulatory settlement that was recorded in the first quarter of 2018.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 24.2 percent and 21.5 percent for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 23.9 percent and 23.0 percent for the six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively.
Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2018, our annual selling, general and administrative expenses have varied between 19.4 percent and 21.8 percent of revenue, and excluding the impact of the $15.0 million regulatory settlement cost described above, we currently expect these expenses to remain within that approximate range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Loss on sale of business.

Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019, was $7.3 million, compared to $4.0 million for the same period of 2018.
Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $12.8 million, compared to $8.0 million for the same period of 2018.
Interest expense for the three and six month period in 2019 was primarily associated with the $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes and interest on amounts drawn under our credit facility.
Interest expense for the same periods in 2018 were primarily associated with the $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes.
Our income tax provision of $12.0 million and $25.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, represents an effective tax rate of 20.7 percent and 18.8 percent.
Our income tax provision for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was $11.4 million and $26.8 million, which represented an effective tax rate of 13.7 percent and 19.5 percent.
The three reportable segments continue to be the Industrial business unit, Government and Defense business unit and the Commercial business unit.
See Note 19, “Operating Segments and Related Information,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of each operating segment, including the types of products and services from which each operating segment derives its revenues.
Industrial business unit revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 was flat compared to the same period of 2018.
Industrial business unit revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased by 2.6%, compared to the same period of 2018.
The increase in revenue for the six month period was predominately attributable to strong growth across the cooled cores product lines partially offset by declines in the Instruments and Integrated Imaging Systems (IIS) businesses.
The increases in earnings from operations and corresponding operating margin for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same periods of 2018, were predominately attributable to favorable product mix led by the OEM business and productivity initiatives to improve manufacturing efficiency and decrease product costs across all divisions.
Government and Defense business unit revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 increased by 22.7 percent compared to the same period of 2018.
Government and Defense business unit revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased by 15.8 percent compared to the same period of 2018.
The increase in revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same periods of 2018, was primarily driven by the Aeryon and Endeavor acquisitions during the first quarter of 2019 and increased volumes of UAS products and surveillance systems.
Earnings from operations are only up slightly for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 while operating margins declined for the same periods due to the inclusion of the operating losses from the same acquisitions noted above.
See Note 20, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Commercial business unit revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 decreased by 7.4 percent compared to the same period of 2018.
Commercial business unit revenue for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 decreased by 11.9 percent compared to the same period of 2018.
The decrease in both revenue and earnings from operations and corresponding operating margin for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 is primarily attributed to volume declines in our Maritime and OTS businesses.
The decrease in year-over-year backlog is partially attributed to volume declines in the Maritime and OTS businesses.
Additionally, there was an international order in current backlog as of June 30, 2018, which was moved to non-current backlog in late 2018 and subsequently canceled.
At June 30, 2019, we had a total of $268.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $70.8 million of which resided in the United States and $198.1 million at our foreign subsidiaries, compared to cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018, of $512.1 million, of which $327.0 million resided in the United States and $185.1 million at our foreign subsidiaries.
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the six months ended June 30, 2019, was primarily due to cash used for business acquisitions of $602.5 million, common stock repurchases of $50.0 million, dividend payments of $46.1 million, a minority interest investment of $5.0 million and capital expenditures of $17.8 million, partially offset by cash provided from operations of $123.3 million, net proceeds of $345.0 million from our revolving credit facility and long-term debt, and proceeds of $17.4 million from shares issued under our stock compensation plans.
Cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2019 totaled $123.3 million, which primarily consisted of net earnings, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other non-cash items and changes in working capital.
The decrease of cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to changes in working capital balances driven by increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable as well as a decrease in net income in the period.
Cash used by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 totaled $622.3 million, which consisted primarily of business acquisitions, a minority interest investment and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business.
Cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 totaled $255.4 million, which primarily consisted of cash provided from net proceeds from our revolving credit facility and long-term debt, and proceeds from shares issued under our stock compensation plans, partially offset by repurchases of shares of our common stock and the payment of quarterly dividends.
The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company's existing Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 31, 2016 ("Existing Credit Agreement").
The Credit Agreement has a term of five years and matures on March 29, 2024.
Additionally we repaid in full all outstanding amounts, consisting of revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of $375.0 million, under the Existing Credit Agreement.
We have the right, subject to certain conditions, including approval of additional commitments by qualified lenders, to increase the availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $200.0 million until March 29, 2024.
The Credit Agreement allows us and certain designated subsidiaries to borrow in United States dollars, European euros, Swedish kronor, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and other agreed upon currencies.
Interest rates under the Credit Agreement fluctuate depending on the type and tenor of the borrowing, with the most common being a Eurocurrency rate loan based on the published Eurocurrency rate (e.g.
Interest rates under the Credit Agreement are governed based on the type and tenor of the borrowing and includes Eurocurrency rate loans based on the published Eurocurrency rate (e.g.
The Eurocurrency rate loans have a floor of zero percent and an applicable margin that ranges from 1.0 percent to 1.375 percent depending on the Company’s consolidated total leverage ratio.
The Credit Agreement requires us to pay a commitment fee on the amount of unused revolving commitments at a rate, based on our consolidated total leverage ratio, which ranges from 0.125 percent to 0.200 percent of unused revolving commitments.
The Credit Agreement contains one financial covenant that requires maintenance of a consolidated total leverage ratio with which we were in compliance at June 30, 2019.
The Credit Agreement also contains language providing for the adoption of a LIBOR successor rate consistent with market practice.
To manage the interest rate risk arising from the variability in interest expense attributable to amounts drawn under the Swedish kronor term loan, we entered into a floored amortizing interest rate swap with a Swedish kronor notional amount initially equivalent to $150.0 million.
We had $8.8 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement at June 30, 2019, which reduced the total availability under the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement.
In June 2016, we issued $425.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 (the “Notes”).
The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $421.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, which are being amortized over a period of five years.
Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on December 15 and June 15.
The proceeds from the Notes were used to repay our 3.750 percent senior unsecured notes that were due September 1, 2016, and are being used for general corporate purposes, which include working capital and capital expenditure needs, business acquisitions, and repurchases of our common stock.
On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock.
This authorization expired on February 8, 2019.
On February 7, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock.
This authorization will expire on February 7, 2021.
As of June 30, 2019, a total of approximately 1.0 million shares have been repurchased under the February 7, 2019 authorization.
Of the amounts accrued, none are expected to be due within one year.
The remaining transition tax will not accrue interest and will be paid in annual installments beginning in 2020 through 2024.
Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
There have been no significant changes in the Company's assumptions regarding critical accounting estimates during the first six months of 2019.
See Note 17, "Contingencies," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosure of certain matters by the Company to the United States Department of State Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance, communications to the Company from the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security, and the Company's current estimates of the range of potential loss associated with quality concerns identified by the Company regarding certain SkyWatch Surveillance Towers.
All share repurchases are subject to applicable securities law, and are at times and in amounts as management deems appropriate.
This authorization will expire on February 7, 2021.
