International sales accounted for 48.4 percent and 48.4 percent of total revenue for the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The proportion of our international revenue compared to total revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $220.2 million and $441.9 million, compared to cost of goods sold for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 of $227.4 million and $442.9 million, respectively. The decrease in cost of goods sold for the three and six month periods is primarily related to favorable product mix in 2018.
Gross profit. Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, was $232.6 million compared to $206.7 million for the same quarter last year. Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $450.5 million compared to $398.1 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2017. Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, increased from 47.6 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 51.4 percent in the second quarter of 2018 and increased from 47.3 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 50.5 percent during the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in gross margin for the three and six month periods was primarily due to strong volume growth and favorable product mix.
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2018 totaled $46.4 million, compared to $43.0 million in the second quarter of 2017. Research and development expenses in the first six months of 2018 were $91.0 million compared to $85.0 million for the first six months of 2017. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10.3 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 9.9 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue for the first six months of 2018 were 10.2 percent compared to 10.1 percent during the first six months of 2017. We have, and will continue to have, fluctuations in quarterly spending depending on product development needs and overall business spending priorities and believe that annual spending levels are most indicative of our commitment to research and development. Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2017, our annual research and development expenses have varied between 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent of revenue, and we currently expect these expenses to remain within that approximate range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $97.5 million and $97.1 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $205.1 million and $187.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses for the six month period is primarily attributed to $15.0 million recorded in the first quarter of 2018 for the costs of a regulatory settlement described further in Note 16, "Contingencies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 21.5 percent and 22.4 percent for the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 23.0 percent and 22.3 percent for the six months periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2017, our annual selling, general and administrative expenses have varied between 19.4 percent and 21.7 percent of revenue, and excluding the impact of the $15.0 million regulatory settlement cost described above, we currently expect these expenses to remain within that approximate range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Loss on sale of business. During the first half of 2018, we recorded an additional pre-tax loss on the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses of $10.2 million. See Note 19, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
In 2016, we recorded discrete tax charges totaling $39.6 million related to the January 11, 2016, announcement from the European Commission of a decision concluding that certain rules under Belgian tax legislation were deemed to be incompatible with European Union regulations on state aid. As a result of this decision, the European Commission directed the Belgian Government to recover past taxes from certain entities, reflective of disallowed state aid, which impacts one of our international subsidiaries. The Belgian Government announced they have appealed this decision and filed action for an annulment in the General Court of the European Union, and in July 2016 we filed a separate appeal with the General Court of the European Union. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” we recorded discrete tax expense of $39.6 million during 2016, related to this matter and on January 10, 2017, received tax assessments from the Belgium government for a similar amount, which we have classified as current taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2018. We have filed a complaint against the Belgian tax assessments, and the result of this complaint, the appeal with the General Court of the European Union, new information received from the Belgian Government, or other future events may cause the income tax provision associated with the decision to be entirely or partially reversed. At June 30, 2018, we held the euro equivalent of $35.3 million in a restricted cash account. Those amounts, or portions thereof, could become unrestricted depending on the outcome of this matter.
Industrial business unit revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased by 14.4 percent compared to the same period of 2017. Industrial business unit revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased by 12.4 percent compared to the same period of 2017. The increase in revenue for the three month period was predominately attributable to strength in the Instruments UAS, gas finders, science and automation product lines and sales to automotive OEMs. The increase in revenue for the six month period was predominately attributable to strong performance in the Instruments and OEM product lines. The increase in earnings from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same periods of 2017, was primarily due to strong revenue growth coupled with product mix in the Instruments and OEM products. 
Government and Defense business unit revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased by 10.5 percent compared to the same period of 2017. Government and Defense business unit revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased by 12.8 percent compared to the same period of 2017. The increase in revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same periods of 2017 was driven by strong results in land and CBRNE related systems. The increase in earnings from operations for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same periods in 2017, was primarily due to higher revenues, favorable product mix and controlled spending. The decrease in year-over-year backlog is primarily driven by the timing of large US Government orders under a CBRNE program during 2017 and subsequent delivery timing. Additionally, there was a large international order in current backlog as of June 30, 2017, which was moved to non-current backlog in late 2017.
Commercial business unit revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 decreased by 16.5 percent compared to the same period of 2017. Commercial business unit revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased 10.4 percent compared to the same period of 2017. The decrease in revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2018 was predominately due to the divestitures of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses during the period ended March 31, 2018, partially offset by strong growth in marine electronics and intelligent transportation related products. The increase in earnings from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same periods of 2017, was primarily due to favorable product mix, led by marine electronics. 
At June 30, 2018, we had a total of $507.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $217.3 million of which resided in the United States and $290.6 million at our foreign subsidiaries, compared to cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, of $519.1 million, of which $228.9 million resided in the United States and $290.2 million at our foreign subsidiaries. At June 30, 2018, the restricted cash balance was $35.3 million and we had no amounts designated as restricted cash at December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash during the six months ended June 30, 2018, was primarily due to share repurchases of $100.0 million, dividend payments of $44.3 million, business acquisitions of $14.2 million, minority interest investments of $9.5 million and capital expenditures of $13.4 million, partially offset by cash provided from operations 
of $153.3 million, cash received from the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses of $25.9 million and proceeds of $16.9 million from shares issued under our stock compensation plans. 
Cash used by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 totaled $11.2 million, which consisted of business acquisitions, minority interest investments and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business, offset by $25.9 million generated from the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses.
Cash used by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 totaled $139.5 million, which primarily consisted of cash used for the repurchase of shares of our common stock and the payment of quarterly dividends.
We had $15.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement at June 30, 2018, which reduced the total available revolving credit under the Credit Agreement.
In June 2016, we issued $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 (the “Notes”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $421.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, which are being amortized over a period of five years. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on December 15 and June 15. The proceeds from the Notes were used to repay our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes that were due September 1, 2016, and are being used for general corporate purposes, which include working capital and capital expenditure needs, business acquisitions, and repurchases of our common stock.
On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. This authorization will expire on February 8, 2019. During the first quarter of 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program at a notional amount of $50.0 million, which settled on June 4, 2018, under which we received 1.0 million shares. The repurchases were under the February 2017 authorization. As of June 30, 2018, a total of 2.0 million shares have been repurchased under the February 8, 2017 authorization. 
As of June 30, 2018, we leased our non-owned facilities under operating lease agreements. We also leased certain operating machinery and equipment and office equipment under operating lease agreements. Except for these operating lease agreements, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”). The amendments in this update require the identification of arrangements that should be accounted for as leases by lessees. In general, for lease arrangements exceeding a twelve month term, these arrangements must now be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee. ASU 2016-02 requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and the Company currently intends to adopt ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019. The Company is assessing the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and expects that the primary impact upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of its minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases on its consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations. 
There were no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of its business during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
See Note 16, "Contingencies," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of an ongoing lawsuit filed by Raytheon Company against FLIR Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary, FLIR Commercial Systems, Inc., the disclosure of certain matters by the Company to the United States Department of State Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance, communications to the Company from the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security, and the Company's current estimates of the range of potential loss associated with quality concerns identified by the Company regarding certain SkyWatch Surveillance Towers.
