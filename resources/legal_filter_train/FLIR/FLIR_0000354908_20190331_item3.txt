The Company’s exposure to changes in market interest rates relates primarily to interest paid on the Company’s floating rate long-term debt.
The Company’s floating rate long-term debt consists of amounts borrowed under our revolving loan facility that bears interest at the respective Eurocurrency rate (i.e.
LIBOR) plus a scheduled spread.
The net effect of the swap is to convert the floating interest rate basis to a fixed rate of 0.59 percent.
See Note 6, "Derivative Financial Instruments - Interest Rate Swap Contracts," Note 13, "Credit Agreement," and Note 14, "Long-Term Debt," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 2 of Part I, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for additional information on the Company's interest rate risk.
