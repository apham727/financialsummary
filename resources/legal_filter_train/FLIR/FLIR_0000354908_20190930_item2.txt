Revenue. Consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019, increased by 8.4 percent year over year, from $434.9 million in the third quarter of 2018 to $471.2 million in the third quarter of 2019. Consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased by 5.3 percent year over year, from $1,327.2 million in the first nine months of 2018 to $1,398.0 million in the first nine months of 2019. Increases in revenues for the three month period was primarily driven by increases in our Government and Defense business unit which is partially attributed to the acquisitions of Aeryon Labs Inc. ("Aeryon") and Endeavor Robotics Holdings Inc. ("Endeavor") during the first quarter of 2019 coupled with volume increases of unmanned solutions and surveillance systems. Increases in revenues for the nine month period were primarily driven by increases in our Government and Defense business unit as noted above, partially offset by declines in our Commercial business unit as a result of the divestiture of the Consumer and Small and Medium-sized ("SMB") Security businesses as announced in February 2018 and volume declines in the Maritime and Outdoor and Tactical Systems ("OTS") businesses. 
Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $241.7 million and $701.1 million, respectively, compared to cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $212.8 million and $654.7 million, respectively. The increase in cost of goods sold for the three month period is partially attributed to the acquisitions of Aeryon and Endeavor coupled with volume increases of unmanned solutions and surveillance systems. The increase 
in cost of goods sold for the nine month period is primarily driven by the Government and Defense business unit for the same reasons noted for the three month period, partially offset by declines in our Commercial business unit as a result of the divestiture of the Consumer and SMB Security businesses in the first quarter of 2018 and volume declines in the Maritime and OTS businesses.
Gross profit. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2019, was $229.6 million compared to $222.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $696.9 million compared to $672.5 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018. Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, decreased from 51.1 percent in the third quarter of 2018 to 48.7 percent in the third quarter of 2019 and was relatively flat at 49.8 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 50.7 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in gross margin for the three month period was primarily due to the change in product mix in our Government and Defense business unit due to the acquisitions as noted above, as well as the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets recorded during the period. 
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2019 totaled $50.1 million, compared to $42.0 million in the third quarter of 2018. Research and development expenses for the first nine months of 2019 were $151.1 million compared to $133.0 million for the first nine months of 2018. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10.6 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 9.7 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue for the first nine months of 2019 were 10.8 percent and 10.0 percent during the first nine months of 2018. We have, and will continue to have, fluctuations in quarterly spending depending on product development needs and overall business spending priorities and believe that annual spending levels are most indicative of our commitment to research and development. Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2018, our annual research and development expenses have varied between 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent of revenue, and we currently expect these expenses to remain within that approximate range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Loss on sale of business. During the first quarter of 2018, we recorded an additional pre-tax loss on the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses of $10.2 million. See Note 20, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Income taxes. Our income tax provision of $5.1 million and $30.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, represents an effective tax rate of 7.6 percent and 15.0 percent. Our income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $12.3 million and $39.1 million, which represented an effective tax rate of 14.4 percent and 17.5 percent. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 is lower than the United States Federal tax rate of 21 percent mainly due to increased benefit in the U.S. for foreign derived intangible income and research credits, combined with a lower U.S. tax burden on income earned by our foreign subsidiaries and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing and research credits. These amounts were offset partially by state taxes, higher tax rates applied to income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions, and other discrete items.
The Company is currently organized into three reportable segments. The three reportable segments continue to be the Industrial business unit, Government and Defense business unit and the Commercial business unit. See Note 19, “Operating Segments and Related Information,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of each operating segment, including the types of products and services from which each operating segment derives its revenues. 
Industrial business unit revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was flat compared to the same period of 2018. Industrial business unit revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased by 1.6 percent, compared to the same period of 2018. The increase in revenue for the nine month period was predominately attributable to strong growth across the cooled cores product lines partially offset by declines in the Instruments and Integrated Imaging Systems (IIS) businesses. The increases in earnings from operations and corresponding operating margin for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same periods of 2018, were predominately attributable to favorable product mix led by the OEM business and productivity initiatives to improve manufacturing efficiency and decrease product costs across all divisions. The increase in backlog as of September 30, 2019 when compared to the backlog at September 30, 2018 is primarily attributed to a substantial award from a large aerospace and defense customer.
Government and Defense business unit revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased by 24.1 percent compared to the same period of 2018. Government and Defense business unit revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased by 18.7 percent compared to the same period of 2018. Earnings from operations increased 4.5 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to same period in 2018 and increased 5.4 percent for the nine month period ended 
September 30, 2019 compared to same period in 2018 while operating margins declined for the same periods. The increase in revenue and earnings from operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same periods of 2018, was primarily driven by the Aeryon and Endeavor acquisitions during the first quarter of 2019 and increased volumes of UAS products and surveillance systems. Operating margins declined for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2019, compared to same periods of 2018, due to the inclusion of the operating losses from the same acquisitions noted above. The increase in year-over-year backlog is primarily driven by the first quarter of 2019 acquisitions as noted above in addition to the timing of orders and subsequent timing of deployment of major programs. 
Commercial business unit revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by 5.3 percent compared to the same period of 2018. Commercial business unit revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased by 10.0 percent compared to the same period of 2018. Earnings from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by 27.5 percent compared to the same period for 2018 and decreased by 20.8 percent for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018. The decrease in both revenue and earnings from operations and corresponding operating margin for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 is primarily attributed to volume declines in our Maritime and OTS businesses. The decrease in both revenue and earnings from operations and corresponding operating margin for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 is also attributed to volume declines in those same businesses as well as the divestiture of our Consumer and SMB Security business during the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in year-over-year backlog is partially attributed to volume declines in the Maritime and OTS businesses. Additionally, there was an international order in current backlog as of September 30, 2018, which was moved to non-current backlog in late 2018 and subsequently canceled.
At September 30, 2019, we had a total of $295.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $93.6 million of which resided in the United States and $201.8 million at our foreign subsidiaries, compared to cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018, of $512.1 million, of which $327.0 million resided in the United States and $185.1 million at our foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was primarily due to cash used for business acquisitions of $601.9 million, common stock repurchases of $125.0 million, dividend payments of $68.9 million, and capital expenditures of $32.0 million, partially offset by cash provided from operations of $276.8 million, net proceeds of $329.4 million from our revolving credit facility and long-term debt, and proceeds of $20.8 million from shares issued under our stock compensation plans.
Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 totaled $276.8 million, which primarily consisted of net earnings, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other non-cash items and changes in working capital. The increase of cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to changes in working capital balances driven by an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a decrease in inventories.
Cash used by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 totaled $632.6 million, which consisted primarily of business acquisitions, a minority interest investment and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business.
Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 totaled $145.4 million, which primarily consisted of cash provided from net proceeds from our revolving credit facility and long-term debt, and net proceeds from shares issued under our stock compensation plans, partially offset by repurchases of shares of our common stock and the payment of quarterly dividends.
To manage the interest rate risk arising from the variability in interest expense attributable to amounts drawn under the Swedish kronor term loan facility, we entered into a floored interest rate swap with a Swedish kronor notional amount initially equivalent to $150.0 million. The interest rate swap was designated, and effective, as a cash flow hedge.
We had $9.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2019, which reduced the total availability under the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement.
In June 2016, we issued $425.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 (the “Notes”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $421.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, which are being amortized over a period of five years. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on December 15 and June 15. The proceeds from the Notes were used to repay our 3.750 percent senior unsecured notes that were due September 1, 2016, and are being used for general corporate purposes, which include working capital and capital expenditure needs, business acquisitions, and repurchases of our common stock.
On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. This authorization expired on February 8, 2019. On February 7, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. This authorization will expire on February 7, 2021. As of September 30, 2019, a total of approximately 2.5 million shares have been repurchased under the February 7, 2019 authorization. 
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company has accrued income tax liabilities of $42.9 million related to the transition tax enacted on December 22, 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Of the amounts accrued, none are expected to be due within one year. The remaining transition tax will not accrue interest and will be paid in annual installments beginning in 2020 through 2024.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("ASU 2016-13" or "Topic 326"), which significantly changes the way entities recognize impairment of many financial assets by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over their remaining life. Subsequently, the FASB has issued several amendments to the new standard to clarify the implementation. ASU 2016-13 and all related amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 using a modified-retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company plans to adopt the standard as of January 1, 2020 and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its financial statements and related disclosures, but does not anticipate a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
There were no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of its business during the quarter ended September 30, 2019. As described above in "Liquidity and Capital Resources," the Company borrowed $100 million under the revolving credit facility and $250 million under the term loan facility in conjunction with the closing of the Credit Agreement on March 29, 2019.
See Note 17, "Contingencies," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosure of certain matters by the Company to the United States Department of State Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance, communications to the Company from the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security, and the Company's current estimates of the range of potential loss associated with quality concerns identified by the Company regarding certain SkyWatch Surveillance Towers.
All share repurchases are subject to applicable securities law, and are at times and in amounts as management deems appropriate. These repurchases were through open market transactions under the authorization by our Board of Directors on February 7, 2019 to repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. This authorization will expire on February 7, 2021.
