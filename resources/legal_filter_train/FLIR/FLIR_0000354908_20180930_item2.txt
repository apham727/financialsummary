Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $212.8 million and $654.7 million, compared to cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 of $241.8 million and $684.7 million, respectively. The decrease in cost of goods sold for the three and nine month periods is primarily related to the decline in our Commercial business unit as a result of the Consumer and SMB Security business divestiture. 
Gross profit. Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, was $222.1 million compared to $222.9 million for the same quarter last year. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $672.5 million compared to $620.9 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2017. Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, increased from 48.0 percent in the third quarter of 2017 to 51.1 percent in the third quarter of 2018 and increased from 47.6 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to 50.7 percent during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in gross margin for the three and nine month periods was primarily due to favorable product mix.
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2018 totaled $42.0 million, compared to $42.9 million in the third quarter of 2017. Research and development expenses in the first nine months of 2018 were $133.0 million compared to $127.9 million for the first nine months of 2017. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were 9.7 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 9.2 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue for the first nine months of 2018 were 10.0 percent compared to 9.8 percent during the first nine months of 2017. We have, and will continue to have, fluctuations in quarterly spending depending on product development needs and overall business spending priorities and believe that annual spending levels are most indicative of our commitment to research and development. Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2017, our annual research and development expenses have varied between 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent of revenue, and we currently expect these expenses to remain within that approximate range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $91.5 million and $92.9 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $296.7 million and $280.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses for the nine month period is primarily attributed to $15.0 million recorded in the first quarter of 2018 for the costs of a regulatory settlement described further in Note 16, "Contingencies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 21.0 percent and 20.0 percent for the quarters ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 22.4 percent and 21.5 percent for the nine months periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2017, our annual selling, general and administrative expenses have varied between 19.4 percent and 21.7 percent of revenue, and excluding the impact of the $15.0 million regulatory settlement cost described above, we currently expect these expenses to remain within that approximate range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Loss on sale of business. During the first half of 2018, we recorded an additional pre-tax loss on the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses of $10.2 million. See Note 19, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Income taxes. Our income tax provision of $12.3 million and $39.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, represents an effective tax rate of 14.4 percent and 17.5 percent. Our income tax provision for the three and nine months 
ended September 30, 2017 was $21.0 million and $46.1 million, which represented an effective tax rate of 24.8 percent and 22.6 percent. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 is lower than the United States Federal tax rate of 21 percent mainly due to excess tax benefits from stock compensation and a reduction in our accrual for the U.S. transition tax, offset partially by state taxes, higher tax rates applied to income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions, and other discrete items.
Industrial business unit revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased by 3.6 percent compared to the same period of 2017. Industrial business unit revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased by 9.3 percent compared to the same period of 2017. The increase in revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017, was predominately attributable to favorable product mix partially offset by volume declines across the Instruments and OEM product lines. The increase in revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017, was predominately attributable to strong growth across the OEM automotive, cooled camera cores, and UAS product lines. The increase in earnings from operations for the three month period ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017, was predominately attributable to favorable product mix across the OEM and Instruments product lines. The increase in earnings from operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017, was predominately attributable to strong growth across the OEM automotive, cooled and UAS product lines. The decline in backlog during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributed to productivity initiatives executed during the period to reduce lead times for customer deliveries of our machine vision and volume hand-held product lines.
Commercial business unit revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 decreased by 30.8 percent compared to the same period of 2017. Commercial business unit revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased 17.4 percent compared to the same period of 2017. The decrease in revenue for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2018 was due to the divestiture of our Consumer and SMB Security business during the period ended March 31, 2018 and partially offset by increased revenues in our Maritime and Intelligent Traffic product lines. The decrease in earnings from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017, was primarily due to reductions in gross margins related to the divestiture of our Consumer and SMB Security business. The increase in earnings from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017, was primarily due to reductions in spending partially offset by reductions in gross margins related to the divestiture of our Consumer and SMB Security business.
At September 30, 2018, we had a total of $593.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $241.2 million of which resided in the United States and $352.1 million at our foreign subsidiaries, compared to cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, of $519.1 million, of which $228.9 million resided in the United States and $290.2 million at our foreign subsidiaries. At September 30, 2018, the restricted cash balance was $35.7 million and we had no amounts designated as restricted cash at December 31, 2017. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to cash provided from operations of $275.8 million, cash received from the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses of $25.9 million and proceeds of $24.2 million from shares issued under our stock compensation plans, partially offset by share repurchases of $100.0 million, dividend payments of $66.5 million, business acquisitions of $22.2 million, minority interest and other investments of $15.5 million and capital expenditures of $20.7 million.
Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 totaled $275.8 million, which primarily consisted of net earnings, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other non-cash items and changes in working capital. The increase of cash provided by operating activities in 2018 over 2017 was due to an increase in net income and working capital improvements.
Cash used by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 totaled $32.4 million, which consisted of business acquisitions, minority interest investments and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by $25.9 million generated from the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses.
Cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 totaled $156.9 million, which primarily consisted of cash used for the repurchase of shares of our common stock and the payment of quarterly dividends.
We had $14.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2018, which reduced the total available revolving credit under the Credit Agreement.
In June 2016, we issued $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 (the “Notes”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $421.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, which are being amortized over a period of five years. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on December 15 and June 15. The proceeds from the Notes were used to repay our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes that were due September 1, 2016, and are being used for general corporate purposes, which include working capital and capital expenditure needs, business acquisitions, and repurchases of our common stock.
On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. This authorization will expire on February 8, 2019. During the first quarter of 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program at a notional amount of $50.0 million, which settled on June 4, 2018, under which we received 1.0 million shares. The repurchases were under the February 2017 authorization. As of September 30, 2018, a total of 2.0 million shares have been repurchased under the February 8, 2017 authorization. 
As of September 30, 2018, we leased our non-owned facilities under operating lease agreements. We also leased certain operating machinery and equipment and office equipment under operating lease agreements. Except for these operating lease agreements, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established Topic 842, Leases, by issuing Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02 (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easements Practical Expedient; ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements; and ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements. In general, the new standard establishes a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than twelve months. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application, and allows companies to choose the date of initial application as either its effective date or the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company intends to adopt the new standard on January 1, 2019 and use this effective date as the date of initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated, and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019. The Company is assessing the impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and expects that the primary impact upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of its minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases on its consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations and providing significant new disclosures about its leasing activities. 
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, "Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2018-07"). The standard more closely aligns the accounting for employee and nonemployee share-based payments. The standard is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract” (“ASU 2018-15”). The amendments in this update align the requirements for 
capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this update. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
There were no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of its business during the quarter ended September 30, 2018.
See Note 16, "Contingencies," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosure of certain matters by the Company to the United States Department of State Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance, communications to the Company from the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security, and the Company's current estimates of the range of potential loss associated with quality concerns identified by the Company regarding certain SkyWatch Surveillance Towers.
