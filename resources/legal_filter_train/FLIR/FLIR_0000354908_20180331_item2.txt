Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $221.7 million, compared to cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $215.5 million. The year over year increase in cost of goods sold is primarily related to higher revenues in 2018.
Gross profit. Gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $217.9 million compared to $191.3 million for the same quarter last year. Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, increased from 47.0 percent in the first quarter of 2017 to 49.6 percent in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in gross margin for the three month period was primarily due to favorable product mix.
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $44.6 million, compared to $42.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10.1 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 10.3 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017. We have, and will continue to have, fluctuations in quarterly spending depending on product development needs and overall business spending priorities and believe that annual spending levels are most indicative of our commitment to research and development. Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2017, our annual research and development expenses have varied between 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent of revenue, and we currently expect these expenses to remain within that range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $107.7 million and $90.3 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 is primarily attributed to a $15.0 million accrual recorded in the period for the anticipated costs of a regulatory settlement described further in Note 16, "Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 24.5 percent and 22.2 percent for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2017, our annual selling, general and administrative expenses have varied between 19.4 percent and 21.7 percent of revenue, and excluding the impact of the $15.0 million accrual described above, we currently expect these expenses to remain within that range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Loss on sale of business. During the first quarter of 2018, we recorded an additional pre-tax loss on the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses of $10.2 million. See Note 19, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.
Income taxes. Our income tax provision of $15.4 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, represents an effective tax rate of 28.2 percent. Our income tax provision for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 was $13.0 million, which represented an effective tax rate of 23.4 percent. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is higher than the United States Federal tax rate of 21 percent mainly due to state taxes, higher tax rates applied to income earned in foreign jurisdictions, accruals for non-deductible penalties, and other discrete items, offset by the effect of federal, foreign and state tax credits and excess tax benefits from stock compensation.
In 2016, we recorded discrete tax charges totaling $39.6 million related to the January 11, 2016, announcement from the European Commission of a decision concluding that certain rules under Belgian tax legislation were deemed to be incompatible with European Union regulations on state aid. As a result of this decision, the European Commission directed the Belgian Government to recover past taxes from certain entities, reflective of disallowed state aid, which impacts one of our international subsidiaries. The Belgian Government announced they have appealed this decision and filed action for an annulment in the General Court of the European Union, and in July 2016 we filed a separate appeal with the General Court of the European Union. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” we recorded discrete tax expense of $39.6 million during 2016, related to this matter and on January 10, 2017, received tax assessments from the Belgium government for a similar amount, which we have classified as current taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2018. We have filed a complaint against the Belgian tax assessments, and the result of this complaint, the appeal with the General Court of the European Union, new 
Industrial business unit revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, increased by 10.3 percent compared to the same period of 2017. The increase in revenue for the three-month period was predominately attributable to strength in the Instruments handheld market, UAS, and sales to OEMs. The increase in earnings from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same periods of 2017, was primarily due to the higher revenue. 
Government and Defense business unit revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, increased by 15.3 percent compared to the same period of 2017.

The increase in earnings from operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same periods in 2017, was primarily due to higher revenues and favorable product mix.

Commercial business unit revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, decreased by 3.7 percent compared to the same period of 2017. The decrease in revenue for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was predominately due to the divestitures of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses during the period ended March 31, 2018, partially offset by higher marine electronics sales. The increase in earnings from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same periods of 2017, was due to favorable product mix, led by marine electronics.

The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash during the three months ended March 31, 2018, was primarily due to share repurchases of $95.0 million, dividend payments of $22.2 million, a business acquisition of $7.1 million, minority interest investments of $9.5 million and capital expenditures of $7.1 million, partially offset by cash provided from operations of $43.2 million, cash received from the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses of $25.9 million and proceeds of $3.5 million from shares issued under our stock compensation plans.

At March 31, 2018, the commitment fee on the amount of unused revolving credit was 0.175 percent per annum.

The credit facilities available under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. 
In June 2016, we issued $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 (the “Notes”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $421.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, which are being amortized over a period of five years. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on December 15 and June 15.
