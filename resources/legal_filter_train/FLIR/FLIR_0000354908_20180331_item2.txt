The “Segment Operating Results” section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated revenue and earnings from operations.
While the backlog is subject to order cancellations, we have not historically experienced a significant number of order cancellations.
Consequently, year over year comparisons for any given quarter may not be indicative of comparisons using longer time periods.
International sales accounted for 48.7 percent and 45.5 percent of total revenue for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Overall, we anticipate that revenue from international sales will continue to comprise a significant percentage of total revenue.
Cost of goods sold.
Cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $221.7 million, compared to cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $215.5 million.
The year over year increase in cost of goods sold is primarily related to higher revenues in 2018.
Gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $217.9 million compared to $191.3 million for the same quarter last year.
Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, increased from 47.0 percent in the first quarter of 2017 to 49.6 percent in the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in gross margin for the three month period was primarily due to favorable product mix.
Research and development expenses.
Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $44.6 million, compared to $42.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10.1 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 10.3 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
We have, and will continue to have, fluctuations in quarterly spending depending on product development needs and overall business spending priorities and believe that annual spending levels are most indicative of our commitment to research and development.
Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2017, our annual research and development expenses have varied between 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent of revenue, and we currently expect these expenses to remain within that range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $107.7 million and $90.3 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 is primarily attributed to a $15.0 million accrual recorded in the period for the anticipated costs of a regulatory settlement described further in Note 16, "Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 24.5 percent and 22.2 percent for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2017, our annual selling, general and administrative expenses have varied between 19.4 percent and 21.7 percent of revenue, and excluding the impact of the $15.0 million accrual described above, we currently expect these expenses to remain within that range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.

See Note 19, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.

Interest expense in 2018 was primarily associated with the $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes.
