Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Investment and Interest Rate Risk.
At September 28, 2019, our investment portfolio included short-term fixed-income investment securities with a fair value of approximately $0.6 million.
These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will likely decline in value if interest rates increase.
As we classify our short-term securities as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.
As of September 28, 2019, we held no investments with loss positions.
However, the fair value of our debt will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.
The selection of the interest rate formula is at our discretion.
The interest rate otherwise payable under the Credit Facility will be subject to increase by 2.0% per annum during the continuance of a payment default and may be subject to increase by 2.0% per annum with respect to the overdue principal amount of any loans outstanding and overdue interest payments and other overdue fees and amounts.
At September 28, 2019, the interest rate in effect on these borrowings was 5.29%.
After 2021, it is unclear whether banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, and no consensus currently exists as to what benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR.
We cannot currently predict the effect of the discontinuation of, or other changes to, LIBOR or any establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere on the global capital markets.
The uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR, as well as the transition from LIBOR to any alternative reference rate or rates, could have adverse impacts on floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use LIBOR as a benchmark rate.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.
As a result, we have risk associated with currency fluctuations as the value of foreign currencies fluctuate against the U.S. dollar, in particular the Swiss Franc, Euro, Malaysian Ringgit, Chinese Yuan, Philippine Peso and Japanese Yen.
Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense accounts are translated at an average exchange rate during the period which approximates the rates in effect at the transaction dates.
The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
As a result of fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. Dollar as of September 28, 2019, compared to December 29, 2018, our stockholders’ equity decreased by $14.9 million.
Based upon the current levels of net foreign assets, a hypothetical 10% devaluation of the U.S. Dollar as compared to these currencies as of September 28, 2019 would result in an approximate $37.7 million positive translation adjustment recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.
Conversely, a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar as compared to these currencies as of September 28, 2019 would result in an approximate $37.7 million negative translation adjustment recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.
