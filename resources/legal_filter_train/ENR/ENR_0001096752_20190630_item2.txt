These Non-GAAP measures are referred to as “adjusted” or “organic” and exclude items such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, Harry’s, Inc. (“Harry’s”) acquisition and integration planning costs, advisory expenses in connection with the evaluation of the Feminine and Infant Care businesses, Sun Care reformulation charges, the Jack Black, L.L.C.
•We analyze our net sales and segment profit on an organic basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods.
Organic net sales and organic segment profit exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency, acquisitions, and dispositions (including the acquisition of Jack Black through February 2019 and the disposition of the Playtex gloves business through October 2018).
•Adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share are defined as net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding items such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, Harry’s acquisition and integration planning costs, advisory expenses in connection with the evaluation of the Feminine and Infant Care businesses, Sun Care reformulation charges, Jack Black acquisition and integration costs, investor settlement expense, the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, the related tax effects of these items, and the impact of the Tax Act.

All comparisons are with the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this data.
Retail sales for purposes of market size, market position and market share information are based on retail sales in U.S. dollars.
We also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and these brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners.
On May 9, 2019, we announced that we have entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “ Merger Agreement”) under which we will combine with Harry’s in a cash and stock transaction that values Harry’s at $1,370 (the “Merger”).
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement and based on our closing share price on May 8, 2019, approximately 79% of the total value of the transaction will be paid in cash and 21% will be paid in shares of our common stock.
The Merger has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both our Company and Harry’s and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of the 2020 calendar year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and receipt of regulatory clearances.
We intend to finance the Merger through a combination of cash on our balance sheet, net new debt and equity.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch has provided committed financing in connection with the Merger.
The Merger of Edgewell and Harry’s brings together complementary capabilities to create a next-generation consumer products platform with an expansive runway for accelerated topline growth and enhanced value creation.
We have incurred costs associated with the acquisition of Harry’s totaling $1.8 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Jack Black, a leading U.S. based luxury men’s skincare products company, for approximately $90.2, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition will create opportunities to expand our personal care portfolio in growing categories in the U.S. and globally, while nurturing the brand equity of Jack Black.
Refer to Note 3 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to the acquisition of Jack Black.
The results of the impairment review indicated the carrying value of the goodwill of the Wet Shave and Infant Care reporting units were greater than their respective fair values, resulting in a non-cash goodwill impairment of $358.0 and $29.0, respectively.
Additionally, the carrying value of the Wet Ones and Diaper Genie trade names were greater than the fair values and resulted in non-cash impairments of the indefinite-lived intangible assets of $87.0 and $75.0, respectively.
Refer to Note 7 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the interim impairment test.
We will continue to evaluate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter as a part of our annual impairment review on July 1.
Refer to additional discussion around goodwill and intangible asset valuation in our 2018 Annual Report.
In February 2018, we announced Project Fuel, an enterprise-wide transformational initiative that is designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure, simplifying and transforming the organization, structure and key processes that will provide the necessary catalyst for further re-investment in the Company’s growth objectives while enabling us to achieve our desired future state operations.
The Company has incurred costs and realized savings for Project Fuel in fiscal 2018 and for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and expects to incur additional costs and realize additional savings during the remainder of fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021.
For further information on our restructuring projects, refer to Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The sale provides the Acquirer with indefinite and exclusive worldwide rights to the Playtex trademark for gloves.
The strategic sale of the Playtex gloves business allows the Company to better focus and utilize its resources on its other product lines.
Total assets sold were $3.7, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $15.3 in fiscal 2018.
Refer to Note 3 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to the sale of the Playtex gloves business.
Net earnings and earnings per share (“EPS”) for the time periods presented were impacted by impairment charges, restructuring activities, Harry’s acquisition costs, Feminine and Infant Care evaluation costs, Sun Care reformulation costs, Jack Black acquisition and integration costs, investor settlement expenses, the gain on the sale of the Playtex gloves business, the related tax impact from those costs, and the impact of the Tax Act as described in the table below.
The impact of these items on reported net earnings and EPS are provided as a reconciliation of net earnings and EPS to adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS, both of which are Non-GAAP measures.
The following table presents changes in net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, as compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2018, and provides a reconciliation of organic net sales to reported amounts.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales were $609.2, a 1.8% decrease when compared with the prior year quarter.
Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales decreased 0.3% driven by declines in the Wet Shave and Feminine Care businesses, partly offset by increased organic sales in the Sun and Skin Care business.
Organic net sales declined in North America by 2.7% while International organic net sales grew 4.2%.
Lower sales in North America were driven by declines in Wet Shave, due to distribution losses, lower pricing and an unfavorable comparison to the prior year launch of Intuition f.a.b.®, partly offset by growth in Sun and Skin Care.
In International markets, organic sales increased in Wet Shave, benefiting from a favorable comparison to prior year sales in Japan, and in Sun and Skin Care, driven by strong Bulldog sales.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, net sales decreased 4.9%.
From a geographic perspective, organic net sales in North America declined 6.1% while International organic net sales decreased 1.1%.
The decline in organic net sales was across all segments in North America and International Wet Shave mainly in Europe, driven by competitive pressure in key retailers and the anniversary of prior year product launches and promotions.
For further discussion regarding net sales, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, see “Segment Results.”
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 48.0%, representing a 60 basis point decline over the prior year gross margin of 48.6%.
Excluding $1.0 of costs associated with the Sun Care reformulation, gross margin as a percent of net sales was 48.1%.
The decline was driven primarily by unfavorable price mix due to increased price and trade investments, mostly in Wet Shave, unfavorable cost mix due to rising energy costs and maintenance spend and lower absorption rates from lower volumes across Sun and Skin Care and Feminine Care.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was 45.7%, down 160 basis points as compared to the prior year period.
Excluding $1.5 of costs associated with the Sun Care reformulation, gross margin as a percent of net sales was 45.8%.
A portion of the decline was a result of unfavorable price mix from price decreases for Wet Shave and Feminine Care in North America partially offset by favorable Sun and Skin Care returns.
Gross margin was also impacted by lower volumes in Wet Shave due to competitive pressures, as well as unfavorable cost mix in Wet Shave and All Other which was partially offset by improvements in Sun and Skin Care and in Feminine Care.
Interest expense associated with debt for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $15.6 compared to $16.5 in the prior year quarter.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, interest expense was $48.0 compared to $52.5 in the prior year period.
The decline in interest expense was the result of lower average outstanding debt compared to the prior year.
The effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was 4.1% compared to 40.2% in the prior year period.
The effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 includes a $549.0 impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, a portion of which are non-deductible, resulting in a lower tax benefit on a net loss.
The rate was also unfavorably impacted by a $4.7 net transitional charge resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act.
Excluding the tax impact of impairment charges, restructuring charges, Harry’s acquisition costs, advisory expenses incurred in connection with the evaluation of the Feminine Care and Infant Care businesses, Sun Care reformulation charges, Jack Black acquisition and integration costs, investor settlement expenses, the impact of the Tax Act, and the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
We expect Project Fuel will generate $225 to $240 in total annual gross savings by the end of the 2021 fiscal year.
To implement the restructuring element of Project Fuel, we estimated one-time pre-tax charges to be approximately $130 to $140, with an additional capital investment of $60 to $70 through the end of fiscal year 2021.
Project Fuel restructuring charges were $8.9 and $42.8 for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, bringing cumulative Project Fuel restructuring charges to $82.7.
Project Fuel restructuring charges totaled $15.9 and $19.6 for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
Additionally, capital expenditures for Project Fuel were $9.5 and $22.4 for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, bringing cumulative capital expenditures for Project Fuel to $24.7.
Project Fuel related savings were approximately $33 and $85 for the three and nine months ending June 30, 2019, respectively, bringing cumulative savings to approximately $100.

The following tables present changes in segment net sales and segment profit for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, and provide a reconciliation of organic segment net sales and organic segment profit to reported amounts.
For a reconciliation of segment profit to Earnings before income taxes, refer to Note 15 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Wet Shave net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 3.9%, inclusive of a 2.2% decline due to currency movements.
Total international organic net sales increased 4.9%, with growth in Men's and Women's System's and Disposables, and was largely attributable to Japan and the comparison to the prior year period which included significant inventory reductions.
North America organic net sales declined 8.9% reflecting on-going competitive intensity, cycling of the prior year period's launch of Intuition f.a.b.
and Hydro Sense®, and the impact of lower pricing on our Men's and Women's Systems products.
Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales decreased $48.7, or 5.0%.
North America organic net sales was down 9.1%, while International organic net sales decreased 1.4%.
Volumes declined in North America across Men’s and Women’s Systems and Disposables due to competitive pressures in the Men’s and Disposables category, and the impact of the launch of Intuition f.a.b.
Wet Shave segment profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $54.1, down $0.9, or 1.6%, inclusive of the impact of currency movements.
Sun and Skin Care segment net sales and segment profit are affected by the seasonality of Sun Care products.
As a result, segment net sales and segment profit historically have been higher in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year.
Sun and Skin Care net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 3.4%, inclusive of a 0.9% decline due to currency movements.
Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales increased $7.0, or 4.3% driven by growth in all geographic regions with the exception of Asia Pacific.
Organic net sales in International markets increased 1.8%, driven by growth in the Hawaiian Tropic and Bulldog brands.
Sun and Skin Care net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased 1.6%, inclusive of a 4.6% increase due to the acquisition of Jack Black, a 0.3% decline due to the Playtex gloves sale, and a 1.3% decline due to currency movements.
International Sun Care volume declines were more than offset by increased Bulldog sales.
Sun Care had favorable price mix related to favorable returns compared to same period in the prior year and timing of promotions.
Feminine Care net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $3.2, or 3.8%, inclusive of a 0.4% decline due to the impact of currency movements.
Price mix was unfavorable due to increased trade spend.

All Other net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 1.2%, inclusive of a 0.6% decline from the impact of currency movements.
All Other net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 decreased 2.8%, inclusive of a 0.7% decline due to the impact of currency movements.
Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales decreased $2.0 or 2.1%, as declines in volumes of Diaper Genie and infant bottles and unfavorable price mix from Pet Care products were partially offset by growth in infant cups and mealtime products.
All Other segment profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $3.6, a decrease of $1.8, or 33.3%, inclusive of a decrease of 1.8% for currency movements.
The decline is driven primarily by unfavorable product mix of Diaper Genie products and higher product costs.

For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, general corporate expenses were $43.5, or 2.7% of net sales, compared to $55.6, or 3.3% of net sales, in the prior year period.
Corporate expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 declined due to savings generated through Project Fuel and lower share-based compensation expense.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, the declines in corporate expense were driven by savings generated through Project Fuel, including lower compensation expense and prior year one-time expenses such as severance and asset write offs.
We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed.
We generally repatriate a portion of current year earnings from select non-U.S. subsidiaries only if the economic cost of the repatriation is not considered material.
The counterparties to deposits consist of several major financial institutions.
We consistently monitor positions with, and credit ratings of, counterparties both internally and by using outside ratings agencies.
Our total borrowings were $1,237.6 at June 30, 2019, including $125.0 tied to variable interest rates.
Our total borrowings at September 30, 2018 were $1,300.2.
As of June 30, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $125.0 under our unsecured revolving credit facility in the U.S. (the “Revolving Facility”) and $8.5 of outstanding letters of credit.
Taking into account outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit at June 30, 2019, $591.5 remains available under the Revolving Facility.
We expect to refinance the Revolving Facility prior to its maturity date in June 2020.
At September 30, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $7.0 under the Revolving Facility.
On February 6, 2019, we made a $185.0 prepayment to retire the Term Loan.

In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch pursuant to which Bank of America Merrill Lynch committed to provide a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0, a senior secured term loan A facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 and a senior secured term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $800.0 in order to, among other things, finance our obligations under the Merger Agreement and certain related transactions.
The effectiveness of such credit facilities is subject to the occurrence of customary closing conditions, including the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Historically, we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations.
Our cash flows are affected by the seasonality of our Sun Care products, resulting in higher net sales and increased cash generated in the second and third quarter each year.
We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available borrowing under the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital requirements, interest payments, research and development activities, capital expenditures, and other financing requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Short-term financing needs primarily consist of working capital requirements, principal, and interest payments on our long-term debt.
Long-term financing needs will depend largely on potential growth opportunities, including acquisition activity and repayment or refinancing of our long-term debt obligations.
Our long-term liquidity may be influenced by our ability to borrow additional funds, renegotiate existing debt, and raise equity under terms that are favorable to us.
The expected minimum required contribution to our pension plans in fiscal 2019 is $7.3; however, discretionary contributions may also be made.
As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with our debt agreements.
Cash flow from operating activities was $98.2 during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to cash from operating activities of $181.5 during the same period in the prior year.
The decline in operating cash flow in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by working capital changes, including the build of the inventory balance in North America related to the Sun Care reformulation project and the build of inventory in Europe in preparation of Brexit.
Accounts payable declined related to the timing of payments at year end and lower current period expenses.
The change was primarily due to the acquisition of Jack Black for $90.3 in the prior year period, offset by the sale of the Playtex gloves business in fiscal 2018 for $19.0.
Capital expenditures totaled $38.7 during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and included $22.4 of capital expenditures in support of Project Fuel, compared to $41.8 during the same period in the prior year.
Additionally, investing cash inflows of $9.0 and $7.2 were reclassified from operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of collections on the deferred purchase price of accounts receivables sold.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we had $118.0 of additional borrowings under the Revolving Facility, offset by repayment of the Term Loan for $185.0.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock.
