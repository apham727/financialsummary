More aggressive and assertive tax collection policies, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S., may increase the costs of resolving tax issues and enhance the likelihood that we will have increased tax liabilities going forward.
â€¢the failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees while implementing benefit changes and reductions in the workforce.
In fiscal 2018, we launched Project Fuel, an enterprise-wide transformational initiative that is designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure.
The project will incorporate our Zero Based Spending and global productivity initiatives, and will include a new global restructuring initiative.
The anticipated savings will provide ongoing financial and operational flexibility for reinvestment to reinforce growth and margin improvement objectives.
Project Fuel follows on several years of productivity initiatives, as well as the initiatives launched with the overall Separation program.
The achievement of our savings targets depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize savings opportunities.
