Risk Factors and "Forward-Looking Statements" included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
While we report financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("reported" or "GAAP"), this discussion also includes Non-GAAP measures.
These Non-GAAP measures are referred to as "adjusted" or "organic" and exclude items such as impairment charges, the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Jack Black, L.L.C.
•We analyze our net sales and segment profit on an organic basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods.
For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, the impact of acquisitions includes net sales and segment profit activity for Jack Black, which was acquired in March 2018.
For the nine months ended June 30, 2018, the impact of acquisitions also includes October 2017 net sales and segment profit for Bulldog Skincare Holdings Limited (“Bulldog”), which was acquired in October 2016.
•Adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share are defined as net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding items such as impairment charges, Jack Black integration costs, restructuring charges, the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, the related tax effects of these items and the impact of the Tax Act.
•Adjusted effective tax rate is defined as the effective tax rate excluding items such as impairment charges, Jack Black integration costs, restructuring charges, the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, the related tax effects of these items and the impact of the Tax Act from the income tax provision and earnings before income taxes.
•Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flows less any capital expenditures in current year.
All comparisons are with the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.

Trademarks and Trade Names.
We also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and these brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners.
Forward-Looking Statements.

•Our business is subject to increasing global regulation, including product related regulations and environmental regulations, that may expose us to significant liabilities.
•Our access to capital markets and borrowing capacity could be limited.
•Impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets would result in a reduction in net income.
•Our business is subject to seasonal volatility.
•We do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.

Risk Factors of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Refer to Note 2 of our Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the acquisition of Jack Black and Note 3 of our Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the sale of the Playtex household gloves business.
The personal care product categories are highly competitive, both in the U.S. and on a global basis, as large manufacturers with global operations compete for consumer acceptance and, increasingly, limited retail shelf space.
Competition is based upon brand perception, product performance, customer service and price.
Our priority is to deliver our strategic objectives, focusing on maximizing sales and profit growth through innovation, product line extensions and share gains, and we continue to target improved working capital management as a key business objective.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we determined a triggering event had occurred as a result of a sustained decline in our market capitalization.
We performed an interim impairment analysis using financial information through June 30, 2018 and forecasts for cash flows developed using our three year strategic plan.
The interim impairment review was performed across all reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets and we found the carrying value of the goodwill of our Infant Care reporting unit to be above its fair value, resulting in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $24.4.
The impairment of the Infant Care reporting unit was caused by declining revenue and earnings forecasts and higher discount rates.
Refer to Note 7 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the interim impairment test.
We will continue to evaluate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as a part of our annual impairment review.
On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Jack Black, a leading U.S. based luxury men's skincare products company based in the United States, for approximately $90.2, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition will create opportunities to expand our personal care portfolio in growing categories in the U.S. and globally, while nurturing the brand equity of Jack Black.
Refer to Note 2 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to the acquisition of Jack Black.
On October 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Bulldog, a men's grooming and skincare products company based in the United Kingdom for $34.0, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition created opportunities to expand our personal care portfolio into a growing global category where we can leverage our international geographic footprint.
The acquisition was financed through available foreign cash.
The results of Bulldog for the post-acquisition period are included within our results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017.
In February 2018, we launched Project Fuel, an enterprise-wide transformational initiative designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure.
The project will incorporate our existing Zero Based Spending ("ZBS") and global productivity initiatives and will include a new global restructuring initiative.
While we are incurring costs for Project Fuel beginning in fiscal 2018, the majority of costs and savings under Project Fuel are expected to take place during fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021.
In addition to the expected cost savings and improved profitability, Project Fuel is designed to strengthen our challenger culture and reinforce our consumer-centric organizational focus.
It is also designed to simplify the organization and streamline ways of working in order to increase competitiveness, speed and agility, and ensure we have the skills, capabilities and investments needed to compete in a rapidly changing world.
For further information on our restructuring projects, see Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
We completed the sale of the Playtex gloves business to a household products company for $19.0 on October 26, 2017.
The sale allows us to better focus and utilize resources on other product lines.
Total assets sold were approximately $3.7 resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $15.3.
Net earnings and earnings per share ("EPS") for the time periods presented were impacted by the impairment charge, the acquisition of Jack Black, the gain on the sale of the Playtex gloves business, restructuring activities, the related tax impact from these charges and the impact of the Tax Act as described in the table below.
The impact of these items on reported net earnings and EPS are provided as a reconciliation of net earnings and EPS to adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS, which are Non-GAAP measures.
The following table presents changes in net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2017, and provides a reconciliation of organic net sales to reported amounts.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2018, net sales decreased 2.1%.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the Playtex gloves sale and currency movements, organic net sales decreased 4.4% versus the prior year period.
From a geographic perspective, organic net sales in North America declined 6%, while International markets experienced a 2% decline.
The decline in organic net sales was primarily due to declines in Wet Shave, particularly in North America, driven by competitive pressure and category declines and Feminine Care volume declines, partially offset by growth in Skin Care due to Bulldog and Wet Ones.
For further discussion regarding net sales, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, see "Segment Results."
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 48.8%, representing a 170 basis point decline over the prior year period gross margin of 50.5%, primarily driven by unfavorable volume mix within Wet Shave, unfavorable cost mix, primarily related to higher input costs, and negative price mix in the Sun Care business, due to increased promotional activity in support of new products and a higher level of product returns.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was 47.4%, down 220 basis points as compared to the prior year period.
The decline was primarily driven by lower sales volumes in Wet Shave and Feminine Care, unfavorable cost mix from Wet Shave and Sun Care and unfavorable price mix from Wet Shave promotions and Sun Care returns, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact.
Interest expense associated with debt for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $16.5, a decline from the prior year period expense of $17.6.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2018, interest expense was $52.5 compared to $52.3 in the prior year period.
Other expense (income), net was expense of $3.5 during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to income of $1.6 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Other expense (income), net was expense of $6.3 during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to income of $10.1 during the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
The current year periods reflect the negative impact of foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses and the revaluation of nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 42.9% and 16.2%, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 and 2017 was 40.2% and 22.9%, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 includes a $17.4 increase in tax expense related to net charges from the Tax Act and the impact of the Infant Care goodwill impairment, which more than offset the lower U.S. Federal tax rate.
Excluding the impairment charge, gain on the sale of the Playtex gloves business, net tax expense from the Tax Act, costs related to the acquisition and integration of Jack Black and restructuring charges, the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4% and 23.9% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our ZBS initiative was established to capture savings and establish cost-conscious spending policies consistent with our strategic needs.
Net cost savings from our ZBS initiative are anticipated to be between $25 to $30 in fiscal 2018, which will be reinvested into marketing spend and our strategic growth initiatives.
In February 2018, we launched Project Fuel, an enterprise-wide transformational initiative designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure.
The project incorporates our existing ZBS and global productivity initiatives and includes a new global restructuring initiative.
While we are incurring costs for Project Fuel beginning in fiscal 2018, the majority of costs and savings under Project Fuel are expected to take place during fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021.
It is expected that the savings generated will be used to fuel investments in strategic growth initiatives and brand building, offset anticipated operational headwinds from inflation and other rising input costs, and improve our overall profitability and cash flow.
In the third quarter, Project Fuel costs totaled $15.9 related to severance and consulting charges and information technology enablement costs.
For fiscal year 2018, Project Fuel related restructuring charges and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $50 and $3, respectively.
We estimate one-time pre-tax charges related to Project Fuel to be approximately $120 to $130, with an additional capital investment of $60 to $70 through the end of the 2021 fiscal year to implement the restructuring element of Project Fuel.
We anticipate that the majority of the one-time charges associated with these initiatives will be incurred by the end of the 2019 fiscal year.
Segment performance is evaluated based on segment profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses, share-based compensation costs, costs associated with restructuring initiatives and the amortization of intangible assets.
Financial items, such as interest income and expense, are managed on a global basis at the corporate level.
The exclusion of such charges from segment results reflects management's view on how it evaluates segment performance.
Our operating model includes some shared business functions across the segments, including product warehousing and distribution, transaction processing functions and, in most cases, a combined sales force and management teams.
We apply a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between the segments.
Such allocations are estimates, and do not represent the costs of such services if performed on a stand-alone basis.
The following tables present changes in segment net sales and segment profit for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2017, and provide a reconciliation of organic segment net sales and organic segment profit to reported amounts.
For a reconciliation of segment profit to Earnings before income taxes, see Note 16 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales decreased $25.3, or 7.1%.
North America net sales declined $6 or 3.6%, largely driven by the impact of lost promotional sales in unmeasured club customers compared to a year ago.
Total Men's Systems organic net sales declined 19%, driven by declines in North America and Asia Pacific.
Total Women's Systems organic net sales increased over 2%, with growth in North America and Latin America, driven by Intuition f.a.b., partly offset by declines in Asia Pacific, related to the inventory reduction in Japan.
Disposables organic net sales were down 3% digits, largely driven by volume declines in North America.
Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales decreased $58.6, or 5.8%.
Men's Systems declined 11% primarily due to North America distribution losses and inventory wholesaler reductions in Japan.
North America Men's Systems experienced unfavorable price mix from higher trade spend and coupon expense.
Women's Systems remained flat as growth related to the launch of Intuition f.a.b.
was offset by declines Internationally.
Disposable and Shave Prep volumes were down, primarily due to category declines in North America.
Sun and Skin Care segment net sales and segment profit are affected by the seasonality of sun care products.
As a result, segment net sales and segment profit tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year.
Sun and Skin Care net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 1.1%, inclusive of a 4.8% increase due to acquisitions, a 2.2% decline due to the Playtex gloves sale and a 1.1% increase due to currency movements.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the Playtex gloves sale and currency movements, organic net sales decreased $4.2, or 2.6%, as growth in global Skin Care, Bulldog, and International Sun Care, was more than offset by sales declines in North America Sun Care.
The declines in North America Sun Care were due to higher returns, slightly lower volumes, and the impact of the exit of the private label Sun Care business.
Sun and Skin Care net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased 1.3%, inclusive of a 3.4% increase due to acquisitions, a 2.8% decline due to the Playtex gloves sale and a 1.3% increase due to currency movements.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the Playtex gloves sale and currency movements, organic net sales decreased $2.2, or 0.6%, with strong performance in Skin Care as growth in Bulldog and Wet Ones during the first nine months were offset by declines in Hawaiian Tropic and the exit of the private label Sun Care business.

All Other net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 3.5%, inclusive of a 1.0% increase due to the impact of currency movements.
Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales increased $0.8, or 2.5%, primarily due to growth in Pet Care and favorable price mix in Infant Care.
All Other net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 decreased 2.9%, inclusive of a 0.9% increase due to the impact of currency movements.
Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales decreased $3.7 or 3.8%, as declines in volumes of Diaper Genie and infant cups and bottles were partially offset by growth in pet care products.
All Other segment profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $5.5, a decrease of $1.2, or 17.9%, inclusive of a 3.0% increase due to the impact of currency movements.
Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic segment profit decreased 20.9%, primarily due to unfavorable cost mix driven by higher materials and warehouse and distribution costs.
All Other segment profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $17.0, a decrease of $4.3 or 20.3% compared to the prior year period, inclusive of a 2.7% increase due to the impact of currency movements.

For the first nine months of fiscal 2018, general corporate expenses were $54.7, or 3.2% of net sales, compared to $58.1, or 3.4% of net sales, in the prior year period.
For both the quarter and nine month period, the decreases in general corporate expenses over the prior year period were primarily related to lower share-based and deferred compensation expense, as well as savings related to our ZBS program.
We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed.
We generally repatriate a portion of current year earnings from select non-US subsidiaries only if the economic cost of the repatriation is not considered material.
We utilized repatriated cash to invest in Jack Black and to reduce borrowings under the U.S. revolving credit facility.
The counterparties to deposits consist of a number of major financial institutions.
We consistently monitor positions with, and credit ratings of, counterparties both internally and by using outside ratings agencies.
Our total borrowings were $1,305.9 at June 30, 2018, including $185.0 tied to variable interest rates.
Our total borrowings at September 30, 2017 were $1,549.4.
As of June 30, 2018, we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility in the U.S. (the "Revolving Facility").
Taking into account outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit at June 30, 2018, $717.0 remains available under the Revolving Facility.
At September 30, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of $245.0 under the Revolving Facility.
As of June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had approximately $185.0 outstanding under a term loan.
We had outstanding international borrowings, recorded in Notes payable, of $20.9 and $19.4 as of June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
The minimum required contribution to our pension plans in fiscal 2018 is $9.6; however, discretionary contributions may also be made.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we contributed $5.7 to our pension plans.
As of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with our debt agreements.
Cash flow from operating activities was $193.3 during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, as compared to $135.0 during the same period in the prior year.
The improvement in operating cash flow was driven by changes in working capital, primarily in accounts receivable, inventory and other operating liabilities from Project Fuel.
We expect that fiscal 2018 free cash flow will be above 100% of GAAP net earnings.
The change was primarily due to the $90.2 acquisition of Jack Black in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, slightly offset by the $19.0 sale of the Playtex gloves business in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
In the prior year we purchased Bulldog for $34.0.
Capital expenditures were $41.8 during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and $45.4 during the same period in the prior year.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we repurchased 2.1 shares of our common stock for $124.4.
In January 2018, the Board approved an authorization to repurchase up to 10.0 shares of our common stock, replacing the previous stock repurchase authorization from May 2015.
There have been no other material changes in our contractual obligations since the presentation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on November 20, 2017.
It is difficult to quantify with certainty the cost of environmental matters, particularly remediation and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment.
Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time.
The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty.
We review our legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions.
We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
The following table sets forth the purchases of the Company's securities by the Company and any affiliated purchasers within the meaning of Rule 10b-18(a)(3) (17 CFR 240.10b-18(a)(3)) during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
