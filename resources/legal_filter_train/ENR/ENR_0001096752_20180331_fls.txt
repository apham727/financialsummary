Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed within "Forward-Looking Statements" below, and in Item 1A.
Risk Factors and "Forward-Looking Statements" included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
This document contains both historical and forward-looking statements.
These statements are not guarantees of performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by those statements.
We cannot assure you that any of our expectations, estimates or projections will be achieved.
The forward-looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document, and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could significantly affect the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements.
All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.
