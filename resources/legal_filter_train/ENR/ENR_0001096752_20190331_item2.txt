Refer to Note 3 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to the acquisition of Jack Black.
The sale provides the Acquirer with indefinite and exclusive worldwide rights to the Playtex trademark for gloves.

The following is a summary of key results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018.
Net earnings and earnings per share (“EPS”) for the time periods presented were impacted by restructuring activities, Feminine and Infant Care evaluation costs, Jack Black acquisition and integration costs, investor settlement expenses, Sun Care reformulation costs, the gain on the sale of the Playtex gloves business, the related tax impact from those costs, and the impact of the Tax Act as described in the table below.
The impact of these items on reported net earnings and EPS are provided as a reconciliation of net earnings and EPS to adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS, both of which are Non-GAAP measures.
The following table presents changes in net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, as compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2018, and provides a reconciliation of organic net sales to reported amounts.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales were $546.7, a 10.1% decrease when compared with the prior year quarter.
Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Jack Black and currency movements, organic net sales decreased 8.9% driven by declines in Wet Shave, North America Sun and Skin Care and Feminine Care businesses, partly offset by Infant Care and International Sun and Skin Care businesses.
Organic net sales in both North America and Internationally declined 9%.
The decline in net sales was driven by North America Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care and Feminine Care, driven by competitive pressure in key retailers and product launches in the prior year period, as well as declines in International, which were largely driven by expected lower Wet Shave net sales in Asia Pacific due to commercial distribution changes implemented in Japan that created a difficult comparison to the prior year.
For the first six months of fiscal 2019, net sales decreased 6.7%.
From a geographic perspective, organic net sales in North America declined 8% while International decreased 4%.
The decline in organic net sales was primarily due to declines across all segments in North America and International Wet Shave, driven by competitive pressure in key retailers and anniversary of prior year product launches and promotions.
For further discussion regarding net sales, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, see “Segment Results.”
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 45.9%, representing a 360 basis point decline over the prior year gross margin of 49.5%.
Excluding $0.4 of costs associated with the Sun Care Reformulation, gross margin decreased 350 basis points to 46.0%.
The decline was the result of lower volumes across Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care, and Feminine Care (90 basis points) from prior year product launches and competition, unfavorable price mix in Wet Shave and Feminine Care in North America (140 basis points), and unfavorable cost mix (120 basis points) in Wet Shave.

Interest expense associated with debt for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $16.4, a decrease from the prior year period of $18.2.
For the first six months of fiscal 2019, interest expense was $32.4 compared to $36.0 in the prior year period.
The decline in interest expense was the result of lower outstanding debt as the Company paid the Term Loan Due April 2019 offset by additional borrowings under the U.S. revolving credit facility in fiscal 2019.
The effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was 33.0% compared to 39.7% in the prior year period.

At March 31, 2019, substantially all our cash balances were located outside the U.S.
We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed.
We generally repatriate a portion of current year earnings from select non-U.S. subsidiaries only if the economic cost of the repatriation is not considered material.
The counterparties to deposits consist of several major financial institutions.
We consistently monitor positions with, and credit ratings of, counterparties both internally and by using outside ratings agencies.
Our total borrowings were $1,328.9 at March 31, 2019, including $215.0 tied to variable interest rates.

As of March 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $215.0 under our unsecured revolving credit facility in the U.S. (the “Revolving Facility”) and $8.5 of outstanding letters of credit.
Taking into account outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit at March 31, 2019, $501.5 remains available under the Revolving Facility.

Historically, we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations.
Our cash flows are affected by the seasonality of our sun care products, resulting in higher net sales and increased cash generated in the second and third quarter each year.
We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available borrowing under our current credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital requirements, interest payments, research and development activities, capital expenditures, and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months.
Short-term financing needs primarily consist of working capital requirements, principal, and interest payments on our long-term debt.
Long-term financing needs will depend largely on potential growth opportunities, including acquisition activity and repayment or refinancing of our long-term debt obligations.
Our long-term liquidity may be influenced by our ability to borrow additional funds, renegotiate existing debt, and raise equity under terms that are favorable to us.

Capital expenditures totaled $22.9 during the first six months of fiscal 2019 and included $12.9 of capital expenditures in support of Project Fuel, compared to $27.6 during the same period in the prior year.
