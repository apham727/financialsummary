We are a global provider of instruments, subsystems and process control solutions that measure, monitor, deliver, analyze, power and control critical parameters of advanced manufacturing processes to improve process performance and productivity. Our products are derived from our core competencies in pressure measurement and control, flow measurement and control, gas and vapor delivery, gas composition analysis, residual gas analysis, leak detection, control technology, ozone generation and delivery, power, reactive gas generation, vacuum technology, lasers, photonics, sub-micron positioning, vibration control, and optics. We also provide services relating to the maintenance and repair of our products, installation services and training. 
Our primary served markets are manufacturers of capital equipment for semiconductor manufacturing, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, as well as research and defense. We have a diverse base of customers. Approximately 56% and 58% of our net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers. 
Approximately 44% and 42% of our net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were from other advanced manufacturing applications. These include, but are not limited to, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, and research and defense. 
A significant portion of our net revenues is from sales to customers in international markets. For both nine month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, international net revenues accounted for approximately 50% of our total net revenues. A significant portion of our international net revenues was from South Korea, Japan, Germany, China and Israel. We expect that international net revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenues. Long-lived assets located in the United States were $139 million and $125 million as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States were $76 million and $78 million as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts. 
On October 29, 2018, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (“ESI”), an innovator in laser-based manufacturing solutions for the micro-machining industry. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we agreed to pay $30.00 per share in cash for all of the outstanding shares of ESI, for total cash consideration of approximately $1 billion. We intend to fund the transaction with a combination of available cash on hand and up to $650 million in committed term loan debt financing. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by ESI’s shareholders. Our obligations to complete the acquisition are not subject to any financing condition. Also, on October 29, 2018, we entered into a commitment letter to provide for a $100 million asset-based revolving credit facility for working capital purposes to replace our existing $50 million asset-based revolving credit facility.  
We adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The reported results for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 guidance while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition. 
Revenue under ASC 606 is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer has been satisfied and control has transferred to the customer. The majority of our performance obligations, and associated revenue, are transferred to customers at a point in time, generally upon shipment of a product to the customer or receipt of the product by the customer and without significant judgments. Installation services are not significant and are usually completed in a short period of time (normally less than two weeks) and therefore, recorded at a point in time when the installation services are completed, rather than over time as they are not material. Extended warranty, service contracts, and repair services, which are transferred to the customer over time, are recorded as revenue as the services are performed. For repair services, we make an accrual at quarter end based upon historical repair times within our product groups to record revenue based upon the estimated number of days completed to date, which is consistent  
with ratable recognition. Customized products with no alternative future use to us, and that have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, are also recorded over time. We consider this to be a faithful depiction of the transfer to the customer of revenue over time as the work performed daily is primarily ratable over time. 
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the product or service that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the product or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Sales, value add, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Our normal payment terms are 30 to 60 days but vary by the type and location of our customers and the products or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products and services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to, or performed for, the customer. None of our contracts as of September 30, 2018 contain a significant financing component. Contract assets as of January 1 and September 30, 2018 were $3.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and included in other current assets. 
We periodically enter into contracts with our customers in which a customer may purchase a combination of goods and or services, such as products with installation services or extended warranty obligations. These contracts include multiple promises that we evaluate to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations. Once we determine the performance obligations, we then determine the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the method we expect to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled. There are no constraints on the variable consideration recorded. We then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative stand-alone selling price charged separately to customers or using an expected cost plus margin method. The corresponding revenues are recognized when or as the related performance obligations are satisfied, which are noted above. Impacts of variable consideration were immaterial during the period. 
Our standard assurance warranty period is normally 12 to 24 months. We sell separately-priced service contracts and extended warranty contracts related to certain of our products, especially our laser products. The separately priced contracts generally range from 12 to 60 months. We normally receive payment at the inception of the contract and recognize revenue over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract. We have elected to use the practical expedient related to disclosing the remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2018, as the majority have a duration of less than one year. 
Product revenues decreased $2.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a decrease in net product revenues from our semiconductor customers of $24.2 million, offset by an increase in net product revenues from customers in our other advanced markets of $21.6 million, primarily from our industrial technologies market. Product revenues increased $189.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, due to increases in net product revenues from customers in our other advanced markets of $110.0 million, primarily from our industrial technologies market, and an increase in in net product revenues from our semiconductor customers of $79.7 million, primarily due to volume increases. 
Service revenues consisted mainly of fees for services related to the maintenance and repair of our products, sales of spare parts, and installation and training. In 2018, we started to record the sales of spare parts in our service revenue and related cost of sales line items rather than in our product revenue and related cost of sales line items. As a result, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we reclassified $5.8 million and $16.4 million, respectively, of product revenue for spare parts from product to service revenue. Service revenues increased $3.5 million and $20.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. These increases were primarily attributed to increases in net service revenues from our semiconductor customers of $3.0 million and $18.0 million for the three and nine month periods ended  
September 30, 2018, respectively. The remainder of the changes were attributed to net service revenues from customers in our advanced markets of $0.5 million and $2.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, primarily from our research and defense and industrial technologies markets. 
Total international net revenues, including product and service, were $243.9 million and $812.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to $248.7 million and $703.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. The decreases of $4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 were primarily due to decreases in net revenues in Korea. The increase of $108.9 million in total international net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, were due to increases in net revenues in Japan, Germany, and China. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net product revenues increased by 1.3 percentage points for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to favorable product mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net product revenues increased by 1.1 percentage points for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher revenue volumes. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues decreased by 3.6 percentage points for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher material costs from unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower overhead costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues increased 1.0 percentage points for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower overhead costs, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. 
Research and development expenses decreased $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease of project materials.  
Research and development expenses increased $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $3.0 million in compensation costs and benefits. 
Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing and improving our instruments, components, subsystems and process control solutions to improve process performance and productivity. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $12.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $8.4 million of compensation costs and related benefits, and $4.0 million of consulting and professional fees. 
We recorded acquisition and integration costs related to the Company’s acquisition of Newport Corporation in April 2016 (the “Newport Merger”) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we reversed a portion of these costs related to severance agreement provisions that were not met. 
We recorded restructuring costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, which were primarily comprised of severance costs related to a moderate reduction in workforce during the third quarter of 2018 and transferring a portion of our shared accounting functions in the United States to a third party as well as the consolidation of certain shared accounting functions in Asia. We recorded restructuring costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 related to the discontinuation of a product line resulting in the consolidation of two manufacturing plants, the restructuring of one of our international facilities and the consolidation of sales offices. 
We recorded $6.7 million of asset impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 due to the consolidation of two manufacturing plants. These charges primarily related to the write-off of certain goodwill and intangible assets. 
We recorded fees and expenses related to the third and fourth repricing, respectively, of our Term Loan Facility (as defined below under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Term Loan Credit Agreement.” 
Amortization of intangible assets decreased by $0.3 million and $2.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. 
Interest expense, net, decreased by $4.1 million and $12.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. The decreases for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2018 were due primarily to principal prepayments of $275.0 million since the beginning of 2017, and repricings of, our Term Loan Facility. 
We recorded a $74.9 million gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 on the sale of our Data Analytics Solutions business during the second quarter of 2017. 
The changes in other expense, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily related to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was 25.0% and 22.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate mainly due to the impact of lower tax rates on foreign income and the deductions for domestic production activities and windfall tax benefits of stock compensation. 
At September 30, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $32.5 million. At December 31, 2017, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $27.3 million. The net increase from December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to uncertain tax positions and the addition of income tax reserves related to the one-time transition tax from the Act. At September 30, 2018, excluding interest and penalties, there were approximately $25.0 million of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact our annual effective tax rate. We accrue interest and, if applicable, penalties for any uncertain tax positions. Interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $278.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and resulted from net income of $321.3 million, which included non-cash charges of $99.1 million, offset by a net increase in working capital of $142.1 million. The net increase in working capital was due to an increase in inventories of $80.4 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $23.1 million and an increase in other current and non-current assets of $17.7 million, related to an increase in business activities, a decrease in accrued compensation of $15.5 million, a decrease in income taxes of $13.9 million and a decrease in accounts payable $0.4 million. These increases in working capital were offset by an increase in other current and non-current liabilities of $8.9 million. 
Net cash used in investing activities was $47.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, due to the purchases of production-related equipment of $36.9 million and net purchases of short-term investments of $10.5 million. Net cash provided by investing activities was $16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 due to proceeds received from the sale of our Data Analytics Solutions business of $72.5 million, offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $38.7 million and purchases of production-related equipment of $17.8 million. 
Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share during the first quarter of 2018 and $0.20 per share during the second and third quarters of 2018, which totaled $31.6 million, or $0.58 per share. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.175 per share during the first, second and third quarters of 2017, which totaled $28.4 million, or $0.53 per share. 
On October 29, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on December 7, 2018 to shareholders of record as of November 26, 2018. Future dividend declarations, if any, as well as the record and payment dates for such dividends, are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. In addition, under the terms of our senior secured Term Loan Facility and our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, we may be restricted from paying dividends under certain circumstances. 
In April 2017, we completed the sale of our Data Analytics Solutions business for total proceeds of $72.5 million, net of cash sold and recorded a pre-tax gain of $74.9 million. 
In December 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the "Repricing Amendment 2") to the Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the Lenders and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders. The Repricing Amendment 2 decreased the applicable margin for our term loan under the Credit Agreement to 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.75% for base rate borrowings and reset the period during which a prepayment premium may be required for a Repricing Transaction until six months after the effective date of the Repricing Amendment 2. In November 2016, prior to the effectiveness of the Repricing Amendment 2, we prepaid an additional $40.0 million of principal under the Credit Agreement. In March 2017, we prepaid an additional $50.0 million of principal under the Credit Agreement. 
In July 2017, August 2017, November 2017 and March 2018 we voluntarily prepaid $50.0 million, $75.0 million, $50.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, of principal under the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2018, after total principal prepayments of $425.0 million and regularly scheduled principal payments of $6.5 million, the total outstanding principal balance was $348.5 million. The interest rate as of September 30, 2018 was 3.8%. 
We incurred $28.7 million of deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the term loans under the Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method. A portion of these fees have been accelerated in connection with the various debt prepayments during 2016, 2017 and 2018. As of September 30, 2018, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the Term Loan Facility was $5.6 million. 
Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with portions of our annual excess cash flow as well as with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, certain casualty and condemnation events and the incurrence or issuance of certain debt. We are also required to make scheduled quarterly payments each equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the term loan, less the amount of certain voluntary and mandatory repayments after such date, with the balance due on the seventh anniversary of the closing date. As a result of making total prepayments of $425.0 million through September 30, 2018 and based on our Total Leverage Ratio, we are no longer required to make any scheduled quarterly principal payments until maturity of the loan. 
All obligations under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of such subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions. 
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. If an event of default occurs, the Lenders under the Term Loan Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Term Loan Facility and all actions generally permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
We have incurred $1.2 million of costs in connection with the ABL Facility, which were capitalized and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over the contractual term of five years of the ABL Facility. 
One of our Japanese subsidiaries has lines of credit and short-term borrowing arrangements with two financial institutions which arrangements generally expire and are renewed at three-month intervals. The lines of credit provide for aggregate borrowings as of September 30, 2018, of up to an equivalent of $35.6 million U.S. dollars. One of the borrowing arrangements has an interest rate based on the Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate at the time of borrowing and the other has an interest rate based on the Japanese Short-Term Prime Lending Rate. Total borrowings outstanding under these arrangements were $0.5 million at September 30, 2018. There were no borrowings outstanding under these arrangements at December 31, 2017. 
We assumed various revolving lines of credit and a financing facility with the completion of the Newport Merger. These revolving lines of credit and financing facility have no expiration date and provide for aggregate borrowings as of September 30, 2018 of up to an equivalent of $11.0 million U.S. dollars. These lines of credit have a base interest rate of 1.25% plus a Japanese Yen overnight LIBOR rate. Total borrowings outstanding under these arrangements were $5.0 million and $3.0 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 
One of our Austrian subsidiaries has various outstanding loans from the Austrian government to fund research and development. These loans are unsecured and do not require principal repayment as long as certain conditions are met. Interest on these loans is payable semi-annually. The interest rates associated with these loans range from 0.75% to 2.00%. 
Since inception of the Credit Agreement, we have made total prepayments of $425.0 million and regularly scheduled principal payments of $6.5 million. The total outstanding principal balance on our Credit Agreement was $348.5 million at September 30, 2018. As a result of making total prepayments of $425.0 million since the inception of the Credit Agreement and based on our Total Leverage Ratio, we are no longer required to make any scheduled principal payments until the maturity date of the loan. There have been no other changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).” This standard better aligns an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet. In transition, lessees and lessors have the option to either apply the standard retrospectively through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of  
adoption or they can apply the new standard to comparative periods presented. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The FASB issued additional updates to the new standard in Topic 842 (Update 2018-01 in January 2018 – Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, Update 2018-10 – Codification Improvements to Topic 842 and Update 2018-11 in July 2018 – Targeted Improvements). We have reviewed the requirements of the new standard and have formulated a plan for implementation. We have communicated our approach to our Audit Committee and will provide regular updates as appropriate. We are currently accumulating details on the population of leases and entering these details into a selected software database, which will be a repository and accounting solution for reporting and disclosure requirements required by the standard. We will continue to assess and disclose the impact that this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements, disclosures and related controls, when known.
