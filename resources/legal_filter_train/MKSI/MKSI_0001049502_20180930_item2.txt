This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
We are a global provider of instruments, subsystems and process control solutions that measure, monitor, deliver, analyze, power and control critical parameters of advanced manufacturing processes to improve process performance and productivity.
Our products are derived from our core competencies in pressure measurement and control, flow measurement and control, gas and vapor delivery, gas composition analysis, residual gas analysis, leak detection, control technology, ozone generation and delivery, power, reactive gas generation, vacuum technology, lasers, photonics, sub-micron positioning, vibration control, and optics.
We also provide services relating to the maintenance and repair of our products, installation services and training.
Our primary served markets are manufacturers of capital equipment for semiconductor manufacturing, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, as well as research and defense.
We have a diverse base of customers.
Approximately 56% and 58% of our net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers.
Approximately 44% and 42% of our net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were from other advanced manufacturing applications.
These include, but are not limited to, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, and research and defense.
The semiconductor capital equipment industry is experiencing a moderation in capital spending in the near term and, we have seen a similar effect on our semiconductor revenue in the third quarter and expect that to continue into the fourth quarter.
For both nine month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, international net revenues accounted for approximately 50% of our total net revenues.
A significant portion of our international net revenues was from South Korea, Japan, Germany, China and Israel.
We expect that international net revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenues.
Long-lived assets located in the United States were $139 million and $125 million as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts.
Long-lived assets located outside of the United States were $76 million and $78 million as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts.
On October 29, 2018, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (“ESI”), an innovator in laser-based manufacturing solutions for the micro-machining industry.
We intend to fund the transaction with a combination of available cash on hand and up to $650 million in committed term loan debt financing.
The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by ESI’s shareholders.
Our obligations to complete the acquisition are not subject to any financing condition.
Also, on October 29, 2018, we entered into a commitment letter to provide for a $100 million asset-based revolving credit facility for working capital purposes to replace our existing $50 million asset-based revolving credit facility.
We adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
The reported results for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 guidance while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition.
We have recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of $1.8 million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606, with the impact primarily related to our service business and certain custom products.
The impact to revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 as a result of applying ASC 606 was immaterial.
Revenue under ASC 606 is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer has been satisfied and control has transferred to the customer.
Installation services are not significant and are usually completed in a short period of time (normally less than two weeks) and therefore, recorded at a point in time when the installation services are completed, rather than over time as they are not material.
Extended warranty, service contracts, and repair services, which are transferred to the customer over time, are recorded as revenue as the services are performed.
We consider this to be a faithful depiction of the transfer to the customer of revenue over time as the work performed daily is primarily ratable over time.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the product or service that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the product or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.
For certain products and services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to, or performed for, the customer.
None of our contracts as of September 30, 2018 contain a significant financing component.
Contract assets as of January 1 and September 30, 2018 were $3.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and included in other current assets.
We periodically enter into contracts with our customers in which a customer may purchase a combination of goods and or services, such as products with installation services or extended warranty obligations.
These contracts include multiple promises that we evaluate to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations.
Once we determine the performance obligations, we then determine the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any.
To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the method we expect to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled.
There are no constraints on the variable consideration recorded.
The corresponding revenues are recognized when or as the related performance obligations are satisfied, which are noted above.
Impacts of variable consideration were immaterial during the period.
Our standard assurance warranty period is normally 12 to 24 months.
The separately priced contracts generally range from 12 to 60 months.
We normally receive payment at the inception of the contract and recognize revenue over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract.
We have elected to use the practical expedient related to disclosing the remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2018, as the majority have a duration of less than one year.
Under ASC 606, we expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.
We make estimates evaluating our allowance for doubtful accounts.
Product revenues decreased $2.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a decrease in net product revenues from our semiconductor customers of $24.2 million, offset by an increase in net product revenues from customers in our other advanced markets of $21.6 million, primarily from our industrial technologies market.
Product revenues increased $189.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, due to increases in net product revenues from customers in our other advanced markets of $110.0 million, primarily from our industrial technologies market, and an increase in in net product revenues from our semiconductor customers of $79.7 million, primarily due to volume increases.
Service revenues consisted mainly of fees for services related to the maintenance and repair of our products, sales of spare parts, and installation and training.
As a result, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we reclassified $5.8 million and $16.4 million, respectively, of product revenue for spare parts from product to service revenue.
Service revenues increased $3.5 million and $20.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.
These increases were primarily attributed to increases in net service revenues from our semiconductor customers of $3.0 million and $18.0 million for the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2018, respectively.
The remainder of the changes were attributed to net service revenues from customers in our advanced markets of $0.5 million and $2.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, primarily from our research and defense and industrial technologies markets.
Total international net revenues, including product and service, were $243.9 million and $812.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to $248.7 million and $703.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively.
The increase of $108.9 million in total international net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, were due to increases in net revenues in Japan, Germany, and China.
Gross profit as a percentage of net product revenues increased by 1.3 percentage points for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to favorable product mix.
Gross profit as a percentage of net product revenues increased by 1.1 percentage points for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher revenue volumes.
Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues decreased by 3.6 percentage points for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher material costs from unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower overhead costs.
Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues increased 1.0 percentage points for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower overhead costs, partially offset by unfavorable product mix.
Research and development expenses decreased $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease of project materials.
Research and development expenses increased $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $3.0 million in compensation costs and benefits.
Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing and improving our instruments, components, subsystems and process control solutions to improve process performance and productivity.
We have thousands of products, and our research and development efforts primarily consist of a large number of projects related to these products, none of which is individually material to us.
Current projects typically have durations of 3 to 30 months depending upon whether the product is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product.
Our current initiatives include projects to enhance the performance characteristics of older products, to develop new products and to integrate various technologies into subsystems.
We believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets.
We recorded acquisition and integration costs related to the Company’s acquisition of Newport Corporation in April 2016 (the “Newport Merger”) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we reversed a portion of these costs related to severance agreement provisions that were not met.
We recorded restructuring costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, which were primarily comprised of severance costs related to a moderate reduction in workforce during the third quarter of 2018 and transferring a portion of our shared accounting functions in the United States to a third party as well as the consolidation of certain shared accounting functions in Asia.
These charges primarily related to the write-off of certain goodwill and intangible assets.
We recorded fees and expenses related to the third and fourth repricing, respectively, of our Term Loan Facility (as defined below under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Term Loan Credit Agreement.”
Amortization of intangible assets decreased by $0.3 million and $2.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.
The decreases for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2018 were due primarily to principal prepayments of $275.0 million since the beginning of 2017, and repricings of, our Term Loan Facility.
We recorded a $74.9 million gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 on the sale of our Data Analytics Solutions business during the second quarter of 2017.
Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 18.5% and 17.6%, respectively.
The provisional amounts recorded for the Act were adjusted in the quarter ended September 30, 2018 and resulted in an increase to our tax expense of approximately $0.9 million.
We expect these provisional amounts to be finalized during the fourth quarter of 2018.
Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was 25.0% and 22.3%, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate mainly due to the impact of lower tax rates on foreign income and the deductions for domestic production activities and windfall tax benefits of stock compensation.
At December 31, 2017, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $27.3 million.
At September 30, 2018, excluding interest and penalties, there were approximately $25.0 million of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact our annual effective tax rate.
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
This audit was effectively settled during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
This audit commenced during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and there have been no issues identified at this time.
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that affects the realizability of net deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance.
We monitor these factors and timely adjust our estimates of the effective tax rate accordingly.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $278.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and resulted from net income of $321.3 million, which included non-cash charges of $99.1 million, offset by a net increase in working capital of $142.1 million.
