The Company also elected to adopt the package of practical expedients upon transition, which permits companies to not reassess lease identification, classification, and initial direct costs under ASU 2016-02 for leases that commenced prior to the effective date.
Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of initially applying this new standard, resulting in the addition of $71,042 of right-of-use assets and $20,192 and $54,147 of short-term and long-term lease liabilities, respectively.

Electro Scientific Industries, Inc.
On February 1, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 29, 2018 (the Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, EAS Equipment, Inc., formerly a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and ESI (the ESI Merger).
At the effective time of the ESI Merger and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of ESIs common stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction of any required withholding tax.
The aggregate consideration of approximately $1,032,671, excluding related transaction fees and expenses, and non-cash consideration related to the exchange of share-based awards of approximately $30,630 for a total purchase consideration of approximately $1,063,301.
Represents cash paid of $30.00 per share for approximately 34,422,361 shares of ESI common stock, without interest and subject to a deduction for any required withholding tax.
Represents the vested but not issued portion of ESI share-based compensation awards as of the acquisition date of February 1, 2019.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated acquisition consideration is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of ESI based on their fair values as of the acquisition date.
The Company expects that none of such goodwill and intangible assets will be deductible for tax purposes.
The fair value write-up of acquired finished goods inventory and demonstration inventory was $8,383, the amount of which will be expensed over the period during which the acquired inventory is sold.
Accordingly, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $5,140 incremental cost of sales charge associated with the fair value write-up of inventory acquired in the ESI Merger.
The fair value write-up of acquired property, plant and equipment of $26,667 will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable assets.
Property, plant and equipment is valued at its value-in-use, unless there was a known plan to dispose of the asset.
The acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the economic use of the asset.
The net fair value of the acquired intangibles was determined using the income approach.
As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill to reflect additional information received about facts and circumstances which existed at the date of acquisition.
The Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed subsequent to the purchase price allocation period in the Companys operating results in the period in which the adjustments are determined.
Certain executives from ESI had severance provisions in their respective ESI employment agreements.
The agreements included terms that were accounted for as dual-trigger arrangements.
Through the Companys acquisition accounting, the expense relating to these benefits was recognized in the combined entitys financial statements.
The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations of the Company as if the ESI Merger had occurred on January 1, 2018.

The Companys methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed.
The Company assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the date of acquisition.
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment.

During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded $318,600 of separately identified intangible assets related to the ESI Merger, of which $276,400 was completed technology, $25,400 was customer relationships and $16,800 was trademarks, trade names and backlog.

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding (using the treasury stock method) if securities containing potentially dilutive common shares (restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights) had been converted to such common shares, and if such assumed conversion is dilutive.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 there were approximately 128,200 and 380 weighted-average restricted stock units, respectively, that would have had an anti-dilutive effect on EPS, and would thus need to be excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares.
