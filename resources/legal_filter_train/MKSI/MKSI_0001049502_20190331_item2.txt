Acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc.
On February 1, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 29, 2018 (the ESI Merger).
At the effective time of the ESI Merger and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each share of ESIs common stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction of any required withholding tax.
We paid the former ESI stockholders aggregate consideration of approximately $1.033 billion, excluding related transaction fees and expenses, and non-cash consideration related to the exchange of share-based awards of approximately $31 million for a total purchase consideration of approximately $1.063 billion.
We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from our senior secured term loan facility as described below.
We have a diverse base of customers.
Approximately 52% and 43% of our net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were from advanced manufacturing applications.
These include, but are not limited to, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, and research and defense.
Approximately 48% and 57% of our net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, international net revenues accounted for approximately 52% and 50% of our total net revenues.
A significant portion of our international net revenues was from Japan, Germany, China, South Korea and Israel.
We expect that international net revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenues.
Long-lived assets located in the United States were $198.7 million and $146.7 million, as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts.
Long-lived assets located outside of the United States were $87.5 million and $77.4 million, as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts.
There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2018, other than the adoption of ASC 842 as outlined below.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU), Leases, (ASU 2016-02), to enhance the transparency and comparability of financial reporting related to leasing arrangements.
At the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the facts and circumstances present.
Most leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, short-term lease liabilities and long-term lease liabilities.
We have elected not to recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of one year or less.
Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining fixed lease term.
Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received.
In calculating the present value of future lease payments, we utilize our incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.
We have elected to utilize a single blended interest rate based on currencies, geographies and lease terms that comprise the lease portfolio.
Although separation of lease and non-lease components is required, certain practical expedients are available.
Entities may elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components.
We have elected to account for the lease and non-lease components of each of our operating leases as a single lease component and allocate all of the contract consideration to the lease component only.
The lease component results in an operating right-of-use asset being recorded on the balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis as lease expense.
Many of our leases contain options to renew and extend lease terms, and options to terminate leases early.
Total international net revenues, including product and service, were $239.2 million and $277.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year.
This decrease of $38.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to decreases in net revenues in North America.
Gross profit as a percentage of net product revenues decreased by 5.2 percentage points for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due lower revenue volumes and lower factory utilization.
Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues decreased by 1.7 percentage points for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable product mix partially offset by favorable absorption.
Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing and improving our instruments, components, subsystems and process control solutions to improve process performance and productivity.
We have thousands of products, and our research and development efforts primarily consist of a large number of projects related to these products, none of which is individually material to us.
Current projects typically have durations of 3 to 30 months depending upon whether the product is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product.
Our current initiatives include projects to enhance the performance characteristics of older products, to develop new products and to integrate various technologies into subsystems.
We believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year.
5 to our senior secured term loan facility, as described below, which related to the ESI Merger, during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
We recorded acquisition and integration costs related to the ESI Merger, which closed on February 1, 2019, during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
These costs consisted primarily of compensation costs for certain executives from ESI who had change in control provisions in their respective ESI employment agreements that were accounted for as dual-trigger arrangements and other stock vesting accelerations, as well as consulting and professional fees associated with the ESI Merger.
We recorded restructuring costs during the three months ended March 31, 2019, which were primarily comprised of severance costs related to the consolidation of certain functions in Asia.
We recorded a charge during the three months ended March 31, 2019 related to a contractual obligation we acquired as part of our acquisition of Newport Corporation (the Newport Merger).
Interest expense, net, increased by $3.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to two months of interest expense related to Amendment No.
Our effective tax rates for the periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were 18.8% and 17.1%, respectively.
As of March 31, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $40.7 million.
At December 31, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $32.7 million.
The net increase is primarily attributable the addition of historical gross unrecognized tax benefits for ESI as a result of the ESI Merger during the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, excluding interest and penalties, there were approximately $33.1 million of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact our annual effective tax rate.
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
The U.S. statute of limitations remains open for tax years 2015 through present.
This audit was effectively settled during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and the impact was not material.
This audit commenced during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and there have been no proposed adjustments through March 31, 2019.
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that affects the realizability of net deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance.
We monitor these factors and timely adjust our estimates of the effective tax rate accordingly.
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable investments totaled $462.3 million at March 31, 2019, compared to $718.2 million at December 31, 2018.
This decrease primarily related to the $406.0 million of cash used to fund the payment of a portion of the purchase price for ESI on February 1, 2019.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $29.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and resulted from net income of $12.5 million, which included non-cash charges of $61.6 million, offset by a net increase in working capital of $45.0 million.
The net increase in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in accrued compensation of $22.9 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $17.3 million, an increase in inventories of $10.3 million and a decrease in income taxes of $3.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in other current and non-current assets of $4.8 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $4.0 million.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $72.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and resulted from net income of $105.1 million, which included non-cash charges of $37.9 million, offset by a net increase in working capital of $70.3 million.
The net increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $37.3 million and an increase in inventories of $28.2 million, related to an increase in business activities and a decrease in accrued compensation of $32.5 million, as year-end bonuses were paid.
These increases in working capital were offset by an increase in other current and non-current liabilities of $10.5 million, an increase in accounts payable of $9.3 million and an increase in income taxes of $8.8 million.
Net cash used in investing activities was $874.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and was primarily due to the payment of a portion of the purchase price for the ESI Merger of $988.6 million and purchases of production-related equipment of $14.5 million, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $129.0 million.
Net cash used in investing activities was $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to purchases of production-related equipment of $9.4 million, offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $8.8 million.
Net cash used in financing activities was $67.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and resulted from partial repayment of the Term Loan Facility, as described below, of $50.0 million, dividend payments made to common stockholders of $9.8 million and net payments related to tax payments for employee stock awards of $8.9 million, partially offset by a net increase in proceeds from short-term borrowings relating to our lines of credit of $1.6 million.
On July 25, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $200 million of our outstanding common stock from time to time in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or through other appropriate means.
These repurchases may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
We have repurchased approximately 2,588,000 shares of common stock for approximately $127 million pursuant to the program since its adoption.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no repurchases of common stock.
Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our Board of Directors.
In addition, we accrue dividend equivalents on the RSUs we assumed in the ESI Merger when dividends are declared by the Companys Board of Directors.
Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share during the first quarter of 2019, which totaled $10.8 million.
Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share during the first quarter of 2018, which totaled $9.8 million.
On May 8, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on June 7, 2019 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2019.
In addition, under the terms of our senior secured Term Loan Facility and our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, we may be restricted from paying dividends under certain circumstances.
We subsequently entered into four separate repricing amendments to the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which decreased the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings from 4.0% to 1.75%, with a LIBOR rate floor of 0.75%.
The interest rate on the 2016 Term Loan Facility as of March 31, 2019 was 4.5%.
In September 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of September 30, 2020, to fix the rate on $335.0 million of the then-outstanding balance under the 2016 Term Loan Facility.
The notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement was $290.0 million and had a fair value of $4.5 million at March 31, 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, after total principal prepayments of $425.0 million and regularly scheduled principal payments of $6.5 million, the total outstanding principal balance of the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $348.5 million.
As a result of making these prepayments, we are no longer required to make any regularly scheduled principal payments on the 2016 Term Loan Facility until the maturity date of the loan.
We incurred $28.7 million of deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.
A portion of these fees have been accelerated in connection with the various debt prepayments during 2016, 2017 and 2018.
As of March 31, 2019, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $4.0 million.
On February 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the ESI Merger, we entered into an amendment (Amendment No.
Amendment No.
Pursuant to Amendment No.
5, we also effectuated certain amendments to the Credit Agreement which make certain of the negative covenants and other provisions less restrictive.
The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was issued with original issue discount of 1.00% of the principal amount thereof.
On April 3, 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of March 31, 2023, to fix the rate on $300.0 million of the outstanding balance of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility.
We incurred $11.4 million of deferred finance fees and original issue discount fees related to the term loans under the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.
As of March 31, 2019, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees and original issue discount related to the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was $11.2 million.
We are required to make scheduled quarterly payments each equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, with the balance due on February 1, 2026.
Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to prepay outstanding term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, subject to certain exceptions, with portions of its annual excess cash flow as well as with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, certain casualty and condemnation events and the incurrence or issuance of certain debt.
All obligations under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, and are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and the assets of such subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default.
If an event of default occurs, the Lenders under the Term Loan Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Term Loan Facility and all actions generally permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.
At March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.
In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder equal to 0.25% per annum.
We must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees.
We incurred $0.8 million of costs in connection with the new ABL Facility, which were capitalized and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of five years of the ABL Facility.
As a result of the prior asset-based facility being terminated, we wrote off $0.2 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs.
If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the ABL Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the ABL Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.
We do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). This standard permits the use of the Overnight Index Swap Rate (OIS) based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815 in addition to the interest rates on direct treasury obligations of the U.S. government, the LIBOR swap rate, the OIS rate based on the Federal Funds Effective Rate and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Rate.
We adopted this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). This standard better aligns an entitys risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results.
We adopted this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet.
As such, we did not adjust prior period amounts.
We also elected to adopt the package of practical expedients upon transition, which permits companies to not reassess lease identification, classification, and initial direct costs under ASU 2016-02 for leases that commenced prior to the effective date.
We implemented internal controls and a lease accounting information system to enable preparation on adoption.
Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative effect of initially applying this new standard, resulting in the addition of $71.0 million of right-of-use assets and $20.2 million and $54.1 million of corresponding short-term and long-term lease liabilities, respectively.
For additional information on the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
