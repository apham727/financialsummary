Acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc.  
On February 1, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (“ESI”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 29, 2018 (the “ESI Merger”). At the effective time of the ESI Merger and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each share of ESI’s common stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction of any required withholding tax. We paid the former ESI stockholders aggregate consideration of approximately $1.033 billion, excluding related transaction fees and expenses, and 
non-cash consideration related to the exchange of share-based awards of approximately $31 million for a total purchase consideration of approximately $1.063 billion. We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from our senior secured term loan facility as described below. 
We have a diverse base of customers. Approximately 54% and 42% of our net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were from advanced manufacturing applications. These include, but are not limited to, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, and research and defense.  
Approximately 46% and 58% of our net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers.  
A significant portion of our net revenues is from sales to customers in international markets. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, international net revenues accounted for approximately 53% and 50% of our total net revenues. A significant portion of our international net revenues was from China, Germany, South Korea, Japan and Israel. We expect that international net revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenues. Long-lived assets located in the United States were $175.9 million and $146.7 million, as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term 
tax-related accounts. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States were $90.6 million and $77.4 million, as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term 
2016-02”), to enhance the transparency and comparability of financial reporting related to leasing arrangements. We adopted ASU 
At the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the facts and circumstances present. Most leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as 
right-of-use assets, short-term lease liabilities and long-term lease liabilities. We have elected not to recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of one year or less. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding 
right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining fixed lease term. Certain adjustments to the 
right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. In calculating the present value of future lease payments, we utilize our incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. We have elected to utilize a single blended interest rate based on currencies, geographies and lease terms that comprise the lease portfolio. 
non-lease components is required, certain practical expedients are available. Entities may elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and 
non-lease components. We have elected to account for the lease and 
non-lease  components of each of our operating leases as a single lease component and allocate all of the contract consideration to the lease component only. The lease component results in an operating 
right-of-use asset being recorded on the balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis as lease expense. 
Many of our leases contain options to renew and extend lease terms, and options to terminate leases early. We do not recognize the 
right-of-use asset or lease liability for renewal or termination periods unless we are reasonably certain to exercise the option at lease inception. 
Total international net revenues, including product and service, were $256.6 million and $495.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to $291.3 million and $568.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The decreases of $34.7 million and $73.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to decreases in net revenues in Japan and South Korea.  
Gross profit as a percentage of net product revenues decreased by 4.1 and 4.6 percentage points for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due lower revenue volumes and lower factory utilization, partially offset by favorable product mix.  
Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues decreased by 1.0 percentage point for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher material costs and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges, offset by favorable absorption. Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues decreased by 1.3 percentage points for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher material costs, offset by favorable absorption.  
step-up adjustment to fair value from purchase accounting of $2.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Excluding these adjustments, the gross margins would have been 49.0% and 43.6%, respectively, for these periods. 
Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing and improving our instruments, components, subsystems and process control solutions to improve process performance and productivity.  
We recorded fees and expenses related to Amendment No. 5 to our senior secured term loan facility, as described below, which related to the ESI Merger, during the six months ended June 30, 2019. We recorded fees and expenses during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 related to the fourth repricing of our Term Loan Credit Agreement.  
We recorded acquisition and integration costs related to the ESI Merger, which closed on February 1, 2019, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. These costs consisted primarily of compensation costs for certain executives from ESI who had change in control provisions in their respective ESI employment agreements that were accounted for as dual-trigger arrangements and other stock vesting accelerations, as well as consulting and professional fees associated with the ESI Merger.  
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we reversed a portion of acquisition and integration costs recognized during previous periods related to the acquisition of Newport Corporation in April 2016 (the “Newport Merger”), related to severance agreement provisions that were not met.  
We recorded a charge of $1.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019 related to a contractual obligation we acquired as part of the Newport Merger.  
Amortization of intangible assets increased by $6.7 million and $11.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the ESI Merger.  
Interest expense, net, increased by $8.8 million and $11.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, primarily due to interest expense related to Amendment No. 5 to our senior secured term loan facility, as described below.  
As of June 30, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $40.8 million. At December 31, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $32.7 million. The net increase is primarily attributable to the addition of historical gross unrecognized tax benefits for ESI as a result of the ESI Merger during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, excluding interest and penalties, there were approximately $33.1 million of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact our annual effective tax rate. We accrue interest and, if applicable, penalties for any uncertain tax positions. Interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively. 
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable investments totaled $459.9 million at June 30, 2019, compared to $718.2 million at December 31, 2018. This decrease primarily related to the use of $406.0 million of cash to fund the payment of a portion of the purchase price for ESI on February 1, 2019.  
Net cash provided by operating activities was $106.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and resulted from net income of $50.2 million, which included 
non-cash charges of $107.6 million, offset by a net increase in working capital of $51.2 million. The net increase in working capital was due to an increase in inventories of $30.8 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $24.6 million, a decrease in accrued compensation of $17.8 million, a decrease in income taxes of $3.9 million, an increase in other-current and 
non-current assets of $0.9 million, and a decrease in other current and 
non-current liabilities of $0.3 million, offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable of $27.1 million. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $182.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and resulted from net income of $228.0 million, which included 
non-cash charges of $72.6 million, offset by a net increase in working capital of $118.2 million. The net increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventories of $59.5 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $42.5 million, related to an  
increase in business activities, a decrease in accrued compensation of $15.9 million, as 
year-end bonuses were paid during the first quarter of 2018, a decrease in income taxes of $11.4 million and an increase in other current and 
non-current assets of $4.3 million. This increase in working capital was offset by an increase in other current and 
non-current liabilities of $9.9 million and an increase in accounts payable of $5.6 million.  
Net cash used in investing activities was $936.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and was primarily due to the payment of a portion of the purchase price for the ESI Merger of $988.6 million and purchases of production-related equipment of $28.2 million, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $80.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $16.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 due to purchases of production-related equipment of $21.8 million, offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $5.3 million.  
Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our Board of Directors. In addition, we accrue dividend equivalents on the restricted stock units we assumed in the ESI Merger when dividends are declared by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share during each of the first and second quarters of 2019, respectively, which totaled $21.7 million, or $0.40 per share. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share during the first quarter of 2018 and $0.20 per share during the second quarter of 2018, which totaled $20.8 million, or $0.38 per share.   
On July 29, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on September 6, 2019 to shareholders of record as of August 26, 2019. Future dividend declarations, if any, as well as the record and payment dates for such dividends, are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. In addition, under the terms of our senior secured Term Loan Facility and our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, we may be restricted from paying dividends under certain circumstances.  
As of June 30, 2019, after total principal prepayments of $475.0 million (which includes a $50.0 million prepayment made during the three months ended June 30, 2019) and regularly scheduled principal payments of $6.5 million, the total outstanding principal balance of the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $298.5 million. As a result of making these prepayments, we are no longer required to make any regularly scheduled principal payments on the 2016 Term Loan Facility until the maturity date of the loan.  
We incurred $28.7 million of deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method. A portion of these fees have been accelerated in connection with the various debt prepayments during 2016, 2017 and 2018. As of June 30, 2019, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $2.6 million.  
On February 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the ESI Merger, we entered into an amendment (“Amendment No. 5”) to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 5 provided an additional tranche 
On April 3, 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of March 31, 2023, to fix the rate on $300.0 million of the outstanding balance of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility. The rate is fixed at 2.309% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 2.25% at June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $300.0 million and had a fair value liability of $6.7 million.  
We incurred $11.4 million of deferred finance fees and original issue discount fees related to the term loans under the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method. As of June 30, 2019, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees and original issue discount related to the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was $10.9 million.  
Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to prepay outstanding term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, subject to certain exceptions, with portions of our annual excess cash flow as well as with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, certain casualty and condemnation events and the incurrence or issuance of certain debt. As a result of our Total Leverage Ratio, we were not required to make a prepayment of excess cash flow for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  
All obligations under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, and are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and the assets of such subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions.  
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. If an event of default occurs, the Lenders under the Term Loan Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Term Loan Facility and all actions generally permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.  
On February 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the ESI Merger, we entered into an asset-based credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, the other borrowers from time to time party thereto, and the lenders and letters of credit issuers from time to time party thereto (the “ABL Credit Agreement”), that provides senior secured revolving credit financing of up to $100.0 million, subject      
The Wall Street Journal, (3) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00% and (4) a floor of 0.00%; and (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, with a floor of 0.00%. The initial applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility is 0.50% with respect to base rate borrowings and 1.50% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. Commencing with the completion of the first fiscal quarter ending after the closing of the ABL Facility, the applicable margin for borrowings thereunder is subject to upward or downward adjustment each fiscal quarter, based on the average historical excess availability during the preceding quarter. 
In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder equal to 0.25% per annum. We must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees.  
We incurred $0.8 million of costs in connection with the ABL Facility, which were capitalized and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of five years of the ABL Facility. As a result of a prior asset-based facility being terminated concurrently with our entry into the ABL Facility, we wrote off $0.2 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs.  
The ABL Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the ABL Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the ABL Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. We have not borrowed against this ABL Facility to date.
