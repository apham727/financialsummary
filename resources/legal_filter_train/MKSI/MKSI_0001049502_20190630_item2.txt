Acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc.
On February 1, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (“ESI”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 29, 2018 (the “ESI Merger”).
At the effective time of the ESI Merger and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each share of ESI’s common stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction of any required withholding tax.
We paid the former ESI stockholders aggregate consideration of approximately $1.033 billion, excluding related transaction fees and expenses, and
non-cash consideration related to the exchange of share-based awards of approximately $31 million for a total purchase consideration of approximately $1.063 billion.
We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from our senior secured term loan facility as described below.
We have a diverse base of customers.
Approximately 54% and 42% of our net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were from advanced manufacturing applications.

The decreases of $34.7 million and $73.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to decreases in net revenues in Japan and South Korea.
Gross profit as a percentage of net product revenues decreased by 4.1 and 4.6 percentage points for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due lower revenue volumes and lower factory utilization, partially offset by favorable product mix.
Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues decreased by 1.0 percentage point for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher material costs and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges, offset by favorable absorption.
Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues decreased by 1.3 percentage points for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher material costs, offset by favorable absorption.

These increases were offset by a decrease of $2.4 million of compensation-related expenses related to the legacy MKS business.
Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing and improving our instruments, components, subsystems and process control solutions to improve process performance and productivity.
We have thousands of products, and our research and development efforts primarily consist of a large number of projects related to these products, none of which is individually material to us.
Current projects typically have durations of 3 to 30 months depending upon whether the product is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product.
Our current initiatives include projects to enhance the performance characteristics of older products, to develop new products and to integrate various technologies into subsystems.
We believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets.

These repurchases may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
We have repurchased approximately 2,588,000 shares of common stock for approximately $127.0 million pursuant to the program since its adoption.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, there were no repurchases of common stock.

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder equal to 0.25% per annum.
We must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees.
We incurred $0.8 million of costs in connection with the ABL Facility, which were capitalized and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of five years of the ABL Facility.
As a result of a prior asset-based facility being terminated concurrently with our entry into the ABL Facility, we wrote off $0.2 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs.
If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the ABL Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the ABL Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.
We have not borrowed against this ABL Facility to date.
