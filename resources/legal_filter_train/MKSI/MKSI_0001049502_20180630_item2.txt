This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).
Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 in the section entitled Risk Factors as referenced in Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
We are a global provider of instruments, subsystems and process control solutions that measure, monitor, deliver, analyze, power and control critical parameters of advanced manufacturing processes to improve process performance and productivity.
Our products are derived from our core competencies in pressure measurement and control, flow measurement and control, gas and vapor delivery, gas composition analysis, residual gas analysis, leak detection, control technology, ozone generation and delivery, power, reactive gas generation, vacuum technology, lasers, photonics, sub-micron positioning, vibration control, and optics.
We also provide services relating to the maintenance and repair of our products, installation services and training.
Our primary served markets are manufacturers of capital equipment for semiconductor manufacturing, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, as well as research and defense.
We have a diverse base of customers.
Approximately 58% of our net revenues for both the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers.
Approximately 42% of our net revenues for both the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were from other advanced manufacturing applications.
These include, but are not limited to, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, and research and defense.
The semiconductor capital equipment industry is experiencing a moderation in capital spending in the near term and therefore we expect to see a similar moderation on our semiconductor revenue in the third quarter of 2018.
For both six month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, international net revenues accounted for approximately 50% of our total net revenues.
A significant portion of our international net revenues was from South Korea, Japan, Germany, Israel and China.
We expect that international net revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenues.
Long-lived assets located in the United States were $132 million and $125 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts.
Long-lived assets located outside of the United States were $76 million and $78 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts.
There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2017, other than the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606) as outlined below.
We adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
The reported results for the six months ended June 30, 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 guidance while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under the guidance of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).
We have recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of $1.8 million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606, with the impact primarily related to its service business and certain custom products.
The impact to revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was immaterial as a result of applying ASC 606.
Revenue under ASC 606 is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer has been satisfied and control has transferred to the customer.
Installation services are not significant and are usually completed in a short period of time (normally less than two weeks) and therefore, recorded at a point in time when the installation services are completed, rather than over time as they are not material.
Extended warranty, service contracts, and repair services, which are transferred to the customer over time, are recorded as revenue as the services are performed.
For repair services, we make an accrual at quarter end based upon historical repair times within our product groups to record revenue based upon the estimated number of days completed to date, which is consistent with ratable recognition.
We consider this to be a faithful depiction of the transfer to the customer of revenue over time as the work performed daily is primarily ratable over time.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the products or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the product or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
Sales, value add, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.
The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.
For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
None of our contracts as of June 30, 2018 contain a significant financing component.
Contract assets as of January 1 and June 30, 2018 were $3.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively, and included in other current assets.
We periodically enter into contracts with our customers in which a customer may purchase a combination of goods and or services, such as products with installation services or extended warranty obligations.
These contracts include multiple promises that we evaluate to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations.
Once we determine the performance obligations, we then determine the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any.
To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the method we expect to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled.
There are no constraints on the variable consideration recorded.
The corresponding revenues are recognized when or as the related performance obligations are satisfied, which are noted above.
Impacts of variable consideration were immaterial during the period.
Our standard assurance warranty period is normally 12 to 24 months.
The separately priced contracts generally range from 12 to 60 months.
We normally receive payment at the inception of the contract and recognize revenue over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract.
We have elected to use the practical expedient related to disclosing the remaining performance obligations as of June 30, 2018, as the majority have a duration of less than one year.
Under ASC 606, we expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.
We make estimates evaluating our allowance for doubtful accounts.
We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified.
Product revenues increased $83.7 million and $192.4 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year.
These increases were both primarily attributed to increases in net product revenues from our semiconductor customers of $47.8 million and $104.0 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
The remainder of the increases were attributed to net product revenues from customers in our other advanced markets of $35.9 million and $88.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, primarily from our industrial technologies market.
Service revenues consisted mainly of fees for services related to the maintenance and repair of our products, sales of spare parts, and installation and training.
As a result, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, we reclassified $5.6 million and $10.6 million, respectively of product revenue for spare parts from product to service revenue.
These increases were primarily attributed to increases in net service revenues from our semiconductor customers of $6.1 million and $14.9 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
The remainder of the increases were attributed to net service revenues from customers in our other advanced markets of $2.6 million and $2.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, primarily from our industrial technologies market.
Total international net revenues, including product and service, were $291.3 million and $568.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to $236.1 million and $455.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.
The increases of $55.2 million and $113.7 million in total international net revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year, were due to increases in net revenues in Japan, Germany, South Korea and China.
These increase were primarily attributed to higher revenue volumes.
These increases were primarily attributed to lower overhead costs.
Research and development expenses increased $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million of compensation costs and related benefits and $0.7 million of project materials, related to increased investment in research and development activities.
Research and development expenses increased $4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $3.3 million in compensation costs and benefits and $1.1 million of project materials, related to increased investment in research and development activities.
Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing and improving our instruments, components, subsystems and process control solutions to improve process performance and productivity.
We have thousands of products, and our research and development efforts primarily consist of a large number of projects related to these products, none of which is individually material to us.
Current projects typically have durations of 3 to 30 months depending upon whether the product is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product.
Our current initiatives include projects to enhance the performance characteristics of older products, to develop new products and to integrate various technologies into subsystems.
We believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets.
We expect to continue to make significant investment in research and development activities.
We recorded acquisition and integration costs related to the Companys acquisition of Newport Corporation in April 2016 (the Newport Merger) during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
During the second quarter of 2018, we reversed a portion of these costs related to severance agreement provisions that were not met.
We recorded restructuring costs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily comprised of severance costs related to transferring a portion of our shared services functions to a third party as well as the consolidation of certain shared service functions in the United States and Asia.
We recorded restructuring costs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily related to the restructuring of one of our international facilities and the consolidation of sales offices.
These charges primarily related to the write-off of certain goodwill and intangible assets.
Amortization of intangible assets decreased by $0.6 million and $1.9 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.
Interest expense, net, decreased by $4.0 million and $8.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
We recorded a $74.9 million gain for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 on the sale of our Data Analytics Solutions business during the second quarter of 2017.
Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was 17.3% and 17.2%, respectively.
The provisional amounts associated with the Act were adjusted in the period ended June 30, 2018 and resulted in a decrease to our effective tax rate.
The reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% for 2017 to 21% for 2018, as a result of the Act, also impacted our effective tax rate and tax expense in the period ending June 30, 2018, as compared to June 30, 2017.
At June 30, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $29.0 million.
At December 31, 2017, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $27.3 million.
The net increase from December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the addition of reserves for state taxes and certain non-U.S. items offset by decreases from settlement of a U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit.
As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
The U.S. statute of limitations remains open for tax years 2014 through present.
This audit was effectively settled during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
This audit commenced during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that affects the realizability of net deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance.
We monitor these factors and timely adjust our estimates of the effective tax rate accordingly.
Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable investments totaled $631.1 million at June 30, 2018, compared to $543.3 million at December 31, 2017.
The net increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventories of $59.5 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $42.5 million, related to an increase in business activities, a decrease in accrued compensation of $15.9 million, as year-end bonuses were paid during the first quarter of 2018, a decrease in income taxes of $11.4 million and an increase in other current and non-current assets of $4.3 million.
These increases in working capital were offset by an increase in other current and non-current liabilities of $9.9 million and an increase in accounts payable of $5.6 million.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $175.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, and resulted from net income of $185.5 million, which included non-cash charges of $13.1 million, offset by a net increase in working capital of $23.1 million.
The net increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventories of $34.1 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $15.9 million, related to an increase in business activities and an increase in other current and non-current assets of $2.8 million.
Net cash used in investing activities was $16.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, due to purchases of production-related equipment of $21.8 million, offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $5.3 million.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $103.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, due to proceeds received from the sale of our Data Analytics Solutions business of $72.5 million and net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $40.9 million, offset by purchases of production-related equipment of $9.7 million.
On July 25, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $200 million of our outstanding common stock from time to time in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or through other appropriate means.
These repurchases may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
We have repurchased approximately 1,770,000 shares of common stock for approximately $52.0 million pursuant to the program since its adoption.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, there were no repurchases of common stock.
Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our Board of Directors.
Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share during the first quarter of 2018 and $0.20 per share during the second quarter of 2018, which totaled $20.8 million or $0.38 per share.
Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.175 per share during the first and second quarters of 2017, which totaled $18.9 million or $0.35 per share.

In addition, under the terms of the our senior secured Term Loan Facility and our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, we may be restricted from paying dividends under certain circumstances.
In April 2017, we completed the sale of our Data Analytics Solutions business for total proceeds of $72.5 million, net of cash sold and recorded a pre-tax gain of $74.9 million.
In June 2016, we entered into Amendment No.
In connection with the execution of the Repricing Amendment 1, we paid a prepayment premium of 1.00%, or $7.3 million, as well as certain fees and expenses of the administrative agent and the Lenders, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Repricing Amendment 1, we prepaid $50.0 million of principal under the Credit Agreement.
In September 2016, we prepaid an additional $60.0 million under the Credit Agreement.
At June 30, 2018, the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement was $305.0 million.
In December 2016, we entered into Amendment No.
The Repricing Amendment 2 decreased the applicable margin for our term loan under the Credit Agreement to 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.75% for base rate borrowings and reset the period during which a prepayment premium may be required for a Repricing Transaction until six months after the effective date of the Repricing Amendment 2.
In November 2016, prior to the effectiveness of the Repricing Amendment 2, we prepaid an additional $40.0 million of principal under the Credit Agreement.
In March 2017, we prepaid an additional $50.0 million of principal under the Credit Agreement.
In April 2018, we entered into Amendment No.
The margin for base rate borrowings decreased to 0.75% with a base rate floor of 1.75%.
In July 2017, August 2017, November 2017 and March 2018 we voluntarily prepaid $50.0 million, $75.0 million, $50.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, of principal under the Credit Agreement.
As of June 30, 2018, after total principal prepayments of $425.0 million and regularly scheduled principal payments of $6.5 million, the total outstanding principal balance was $348.5 million.
The interest rate as of June 30, 2018 was 3.7%.
We incurred $28.7 million of deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the term loans under the Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.
A portion of these fees have been accelerated in connection with the various debt prepayments during 2016, 2017 and 2018.
As of June 30, 2018, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the Term Loan Facility was $6.4 million.
We are also required to make scheduled quarterly payments each equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the term loan, less the amount of certain voluntary and mandatory repayments after such date, with the balance due on the seventh anniversary of the closing date.
As a result of making total prepayments of $425.0 million through June 30, 2018 and based on our Total Leverage Ratio, we are no longer required to make any scheduled quarterly principal payments until maturity of the loan.
All obligations under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of such subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default.
If an event of default occurs, the Lenders under the Term Loan Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Term Loan Facility and all actions generally permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.

These loans are unsecured and do not require principal repayment as long as certain conditions are met.
Interest on these loans is payable semi-annually.
We do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

There have been no other changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The provisions of this ASU were applied to our December 31, 2017 financial statements.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement  Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). The amendments in this standard allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Act.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). This standard better aligns an entitys risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet.
In transition, lessees and lessors have the option to either apply the standard retrospectively through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption or they can apply the new standard to comparative periods presented.
We have communicated our approach to our Audit Committee and will provide regular updates as appropriate.
We are currently accumulating details on our population of leases.
We have selected a software repository to track all of our lease agreements and to assist in the reporting and disclosure requirements required by the standard.
We will continue to assess and disclose the impact that this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements, disclosures and related controls, when known.
