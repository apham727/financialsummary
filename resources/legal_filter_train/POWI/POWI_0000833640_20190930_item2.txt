A large percentage of our products are ICs used in AC-DC power supplies, which convert the high-voltage AC from a wall outlet to the low-voltage DC required by most electronic devices.
We also supply high-voltage LED drivers, which are AC-DC ICs specifically designed for lighting applications that utilize light-emitting diodes.
These combinations of switches and drivers are used for power conversion in high-power applications (i.e., power levels ranging from a few kilowatts up to one gigawatt) such as industrial motors, solar- and wind-power systems, electric vehicles and high-voltage DC transmission systems.
Our products also improve the energy efficiency of power converters, helping our customers meet the increasingly stringent efficiency standards that have been adopted around the world for many electronic products, and improving the efficacy of renewable-energy systems, electric vehicles and other high-power applications.
•Increase our penetration of the markets we serve.
We currently address AC-DC applications with power outputs up to approximately 500 watts, gate-driver applications of approximately ten kilowatts and higher, and motor-drive applications up to approximately 300 watts.
We also continue to expand our sales and application-engineering staff and our network of distributors, as well as our offerings of technical documentation and design-support tools and services to help customers use our products.
These tools and services include our PI Expert™ design software, which we offer free of charge, and our transformer-sample service.
For example, our EcoSmart™ technology drastically reduces the amount of energy consumed by electronic products when they are not in use, helping our customers comply with regulations that seek to curb this so-called “standby” energy consumption.
Also, our gate-driver products are critical components in energy-efficient DC motor drives, high-voltage DC transmission systems, solar and wind energy systems and electric transportation applications.
•Increase the size of our addressable market.
Prior to 2010 our addressable market consisted of AC-DC applications with up to about 50 watts of output, a served available market (“SAM”) opportunity of approximately $1.5 billion.
These include the introduction of products that enable us to address higher-power AC-DC applications (such as our Hiper™ product families), the introduction of LED-driver products, and our entry into the gate-driver market through the acquisition of CT-Concept Technologie AG in 2012.
In 2016 we introduced the SCALE-iDriverTM family of gate-driver ICs, broadening the range of gate-driver applications we can address.
In 2018 we introduced our BridgeSwitch™ motor-driver ICs, as described above.
Also contributing to our SAM expansion has been the emergence of new applications within the power ranges that our products can address.
For example, applications such as “smart” utility meters, battery-powered lawn equipment and bicycles, and USB power receptacles (installed alongside traditional AC wall outlets) can incorporate our products.
The increased use of electronic intelligence and connectivity in consumer appliances has also enhanced our SAM.
For example, our InnoSwitch™ ICs integrate circuitry from the secondary, or low-voltage, side of AC-DC power supplies, whereas earlier product families integrated circuitry only on the primary, or high-voltage side.
We intend to continue expanding our SAM in the years ahead through all of the means described above.
Because we purchase a large percentage of our silicon wafers from foundries located in Japan, our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.
Our net revenues were $114.2 million and $110.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $306.2 million and $322.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The increase in the three month period was due primarily to growth in the communications end market, driven by increased demand for our products in cellphone chargers.
This growth was partially offset by a broad-based decline in demand across the consumer and industrial end markets resulting from global trade disputes.
Net revenues decreased in the nine-month period as the broad-based decline in demand across the consumer and industrial end markets outweighed growth in the communications end market.
Our top ten customers, including distributors that resell to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and merchant power supply manufacturers, accounted for 55% and 54% of our net revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and 56% and 57% of net revenues in each of the respective corresponding periods of 2018.
Our top customer, a distributor of our products, accounted for approximately 11% of our net revenues in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, and 14% in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. International sales accounted for 97% of our net revenues in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 96% of net revenues in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Our gross margin for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was 51%, and was 52% in each of the corresponding periods of 2018.
The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to increased wafer substrate costs along with an unfavorable change in end-market mix, with a greater percentage of revenues coming from lower-margin end-markets.
Total operating expenses were $40.6 million and $39.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $121.8 million and $119.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The increases were due primarily to higher salary and related expenses driven by the expansion of our workforce and by annual merit increases; also contributing to the increases were higher expenses related to patent litigation as well as equipment related expenses in support of our product-development efforts.
In October, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with ON Semiconductor to end all outstanding legal and administrative disputes.
Pursuant to the settlement ON Semiconductor agreed to pay us $175.0 million, which is expected to favorably impact our financial results in the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2019.
of litigation expenses beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Refer to Note 13, Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, in our Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding the settlement.
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those listed below.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in “Item 7.
Net revenues consist of revenues from product sales, which are calculated net of returns and allowances.
The increase in the three month period was due primarily to growth in the communications end market, driven by increased demand for our products in cellphone chargers.
This growth was partially offset by a broad-based decline in demand across the consumer and industrial end markets resulting from global trade disputes.
Net revenues decreased in the nine-month period as the broad-based decline in demand across the consumer and industrial end markets outweighed the growth in the communications end market.
International sales, consisting of sales outside of the United States of America based on “bill to” customer locations, were $111.3 million and $298.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and $105.6 million and $310.6 million, respectively, in the corresponding periods of 2018.
As a result, sales to this region represented 77% of our net revenues in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, and 77% in each of the corresponding periods of 2018.
We expect international sales, and sales to the Asia region in particular, to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues in the future.
Sales to distributors accounted for 68% and 73% of net revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and 76% in each of the corresponding periods of 2018.
Direct sales to OEMs and power-supply manufacturers accounted for the remainder.
In each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, one customer, a distributor of our products, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues.
 No other customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in these periods.
Gross margin decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared with the same period in the prior year, due primarily to increased wafer substrate costs along with an unfavorable change in end-market mix with a greater percentage of revenues coming from lower-margin end-markets.
Other income increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in interest income reflecting higher yields earned on our cash and investments.
Accordingly, the interim effective tax rate may not be reflective of the annual estimated effective tax rate.
Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were 8.0% and 4.7%, respectively, and 7.6% and 6.3%, respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2018.
Income earned in other foreign jurisdictions was not material.
As of September 30, 2019, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $325.0 million, an increase of approximately $40.9 million from $284.1 million as of December 31, 2018.
Operating activities generated cash of $42.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Net income for this period was $35.2 million; we also incurred non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization and deferred income taxes of $15.0 million, $14.3 million, $3.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
These sources of cash were partially offset by a $14.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased customer shipments, a $7.9 million increase in inventories reflecting impact of a market slowdown during the first half of the year and anticipation of future demand, a $2.6 million decrease in accounts payable, excluding payables related to property and equipment, due primarily to the timing of payments, and a $3.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily driven by prepaid legal fees, prepaid taxes and advances to suppliers.
Operating activities generated cash of $65.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Net income for this period was $47.2 million; we also incurred non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization of $16.1 million, $14.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively.
Sources of cash also included a $2.9 million decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of cash receipts and a $2.6 million increase in accounts payable, excluding payables related to property and equipment, due primarily to the timing of payments.
These sources of cash were partially offset by a $17.1 million increase in inventories, partially reflecting lower-than-normal inventory levels at the beginning of the year, but also driven by our decision to build inventory in order to capitalize on extended lead times and limited availability for certain competing products.
Also offsetting the sources of cash was a $2.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily driven by prepaid legal expenses and advances to suppliers.
Our investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, resulted in an $83.8 million net use of cash, primarily consisting of $69.1 million for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, and $14.3 million for purchases of property and equipment, primarily production-related machinery and equipment.
Our investing activities provided $69.3 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, consisting of $89.3 million from sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by $19.1 million for purchases of property and equipment, primarily production-related machinery and equipment.
These uses of cash were offset in part by $9.7 million from the issuance of common stock, including the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.
These uses of cash were offset in part by $8.6 million from the issuance of common stock, including the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.
We amended the Credit Agreement on April 30, 2018, to extend the termination date from July 26, 2019, to April 30, 2022, with all other terms remaining the same.
Our ability to borrow under the revolving line of credit is conditioned upon our compliance with specified covenants, including reporting and financial covenants, primarily a minimum liquidity measure and a debt to earnings ratio, with which we are currently in compliance.
The Credit Agreement terminates on April 30, 2022; all advances under the revolving line of credit will become due on such date, or earlier in the event of a default.
In January 2018, our board of directors declared four cash dividends in the amount of $0.16 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2018.
We paid a total of $18.8 million in cash dividends in 2018.
In January 2019, our board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.17 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2019. Dividend payouts of $4.9 million, $5.0 million and $5.0 million occurred on March 29, 2019, June 28, 2019, and September 30, 2019, respectively.
In October 2019, our board of directors raised the cash dividend per share with the declaration five cash dividends, consisting of (a) a dividend in the amount of $0.02 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of the fourth quarter in 2019, which is in addition to the dividend in the amount of $0.17 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of the fourth quarter in 2019 previously declared by the board in January 2019, and (b) a dividend in the amount of $0.19 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2020.
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $51.2 million remaining under our stock-repurchase program.
In the nine months ended September 30, 2019 we repurchased approximately 121,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $7.3 million.
As of September 30, 2019, we had approximately $43.9 million remaining in our repurchase program, which has no expiration date.
As of September 30, 2019, we had a contractual obligation related to income tax, which consisted primarily of unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $20.2 million.
As of September 30, 2019, there were no material changes in our contractual commitments from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In that case, we may be forced to use our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, use our credit agreement or seek additional financing from third parties to fund our operations.
We believe that cash generated from operations, together with existing sources of liquidity, will satisfy our projected working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.
As of September 30, 2019, we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
