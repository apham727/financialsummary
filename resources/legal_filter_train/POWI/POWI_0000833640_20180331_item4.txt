Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance as to the tested objectives.
there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.
Due to the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error may occur and may not be detected.
Management is required to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).
Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
