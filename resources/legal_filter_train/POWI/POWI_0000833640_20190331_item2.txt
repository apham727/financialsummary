A large percentage of our products are ICs used in AC-DC power supplies, which convert the high-voltage AC from a wall outlet to the low-voltage DC required by most electronic devices.
We also supply high-voltage LED drivers, which are AC-DC ICs specifically designed for lighting applications that utilize light-emitting diodes.
These combinations of switches and drivers are used for power conversion in high-power applications (i.e., power levels ranging from a few kilowatts up to one gigawatt) such as industrial motors, solar- and wind-power systems, electric vehicles and high-voltage DC transmission systems.
Our products also improve the energy efficiency of power converters, helping our customers meet the increasingly stringent efficiency standards that have been adopted around the world for many electronic products, and improving the efficacy of renewable-energy systems, electric vehicles and other high-power applications.
•Increase our penetration of the markets we serve.
We also continue to expand our sales and application-engineering staff and our network of distributors, as well as our offerings of technical documentation and design-support tools and services to help customers use our products.
These tools and services include our PI Expert™ design software, which we offer free of charge, and our transformer-sample service.
Our market-penetration strategy also includes capitalizing on the importance of energy efficiency in the power conversion market.
For example, our EcoSmart™ technology drastically reduces the amount of energy consumed by electronic products when they are not in use, helping our customers comply with regulations that seek to curb this so-called “standby” energy consumption.
Also, our gate-driver products are critical components in energy-efficient DC motor drives, high-voltage DC transmission systems, renewable-energy installations and electric transportation applications.
•Increase the size of our addressable market.
Prior to 2010 our addressable market consisted of AC-DC applications with up to about 50 watts of output, a served available market (“SAM”) opportunity of approximately $1.5 billion.
These include the introduction of products that enable us to address higher-power AC-DC applications (such as our Hiper™ product families, which address applications up to about 500 watts) and our entry into the gate-driver market through the acquisition of CT-Concept Technologie AG in 2012.
In 2016 we introduced the SCALE-iDriverTM family of gate-driver ICs, broadening the range of gate-driver applications we can address.
In 2018 we introduced our BridgeSwitch™ motor-driver ICs, as described above.
Also contributing to our SAM expansion has been the emergence of new applications within the power ranges that our products can address.
For example, applications such as LED lighting, “smart” utility meters, battery-powered lawn equipment and bicycles, and USB power ports (installed alongside traditional AC wall outlets) can incorporate our products; the increased use of electronic intelligence and controls in consumer appliances has also enhanced our SAM.
For example, our InnoSwitch™ ICs integrate circuitry from the secondary, or low-voltage, side of AC-DC power supplies, whereas earlier product families integrated circuitry only on the primary, or high-voltage side.
We intend to continue expanding our SAM in the years ahead through all of the means described above.
Because we purchase a large percentage of our silicon wafers from foundries located in Japan, our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.
Our net revenues were $89.2 million and $103.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Net revenues decreased compared with the same period in the prior year reflecting a broad-based decline in demand across all end markets.
Our top ten customers, including distributors that resell to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers, accounted for 52% and 58% of our net revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our top customer, a distributor of our products, accounted for approximately 13% and 16% of our net revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
International sales accounted for 97% and 96% of our net revenues in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our gross margin was 51% and 52% in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to increased wafer substrate costs.
Total operating expenses were $39.4 million and $39.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those listed below.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in “Item 7.
Net revenues consist of revenues from product sales, which are calculated net of returns and allowances.
Net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $89.2 million and $103.1 million, respectively.
Net revenues decreased compared with the same period in the prior year reflecting a broad-based decline in demand across all end markets.
International sales, consisting of sales outside of the United States of America based on “bill to” customer locations, were $86.5 million and $99.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As a result, sales to this region represented 75% and 76%, of our net revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We expect international sales, and sales to the Asia region in particular, to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues in the future.
Sales to distributors accounted for 78% and 77% of net revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Direct sales to OEMs and power-supply manufacturers accounted for the remainder.
In each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, one customer, a distributor of our products, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues.
 No other customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in these periods.
The decrease in gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared with the same period in the prior year, was due primarily to increased wafer substrate costs.
The increase in other income in the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in interest income reflecting higher yields earned on our cash and investments.
