•TruBridge, our third reporting segment, focuses on providing business management, consulting, and managed IT services along with its complete revenue cycle management ("RCM") solution for all care settings, regardless of their primary healthcare information solutions provider.
•Get Real Health, included within our TruBridge segment, delivers technology solutions to improve patient outcomes and engagement strategies with care providers.
Our companies currently support approximately 1,000 acute care facilities and approximately 3,300 post-acute care facilities with a geographically diverse customer mix within the domestic community healthcare market.
Our clients primarily consist of community hospitals with fewer than 200 acute care beds, with hospitals having fewer than 100 beds comprising approximately 98% of our acute care EHR client base.
See Note 16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our three reportable segments.
 Through much of our history, our strategy has been to achieve meaningful long-term revenue growth through sales of healthcare IT systems and related services to existing and new clients within our target market.
As a result, retention of existing EHR customers is a key component of our long-term growth strategy by protecting this base of potential cross-sell customers, while at the same time serving as a leading indicator of our market position and stability of revenues and cash flows.
 Additionally, as we consider the long-term growth prospects of our business, we are seeking to further stabilize our revenues and cash flows and leverage TruBridge services as a growth agent in light of a relatively mature EHR marketplace.
As a result, we are placing ever-increasing value in further developing our already significant recurring revenue base.
As such, maintaining and growing recurring revenues are additional key components of our long-term growth strategy, aided by the aforementioned focus on customer retention, and includes a renewed focus on driving demand for subscriptions for our existing technology solutions.
 Our business model is designed such that, as revenue growth materializes, earnings and profitability growth are naturally bolstered through the increased margin realization afforded us by operating leverage.
Once a hospital has installed our solutions, we continue to provide support services to the customer on a continuing basis and make available to the customer our broad portfolio of business management, consulting, and managed IT services, all of which contribute to recurring revenue growth.
The provision of these recurring revenue services typically requires fewer resources than the initial system installation, resulting in increased overall gross margins and operating margins.
For example, during the first quarter of 2018, we further integrated our acute care product lines into a combined client support group.
Using best practices of the combined companies' implementation processes, we have decreased travel costs for our acute care installations by approximately 25%.
Accordingly, we recognize that prospective hospital clients often do not have the necessary capital to make investments in information technology.
Additionally, in response to these challenges, hospitals have become more selective regarding where they invest capital, resulting in a focus on strategic spending that generates a return on their investment.
Despite these challenges, we believe healthcare information technology is often viewed as more strategically beneficial to hospitals than other possible purchases because the technology also plays an important role in healthcare by improving safety and efficiency and reducing costs.
Additionally, we believe most hospitals recognize that they must invest in healthcare information technology to meet current and future regulatory, compliance and government reimbursement requirements.
In recent years, there have been significant changes to provider reimbursement by the U.S. federal government, followed by commercial payers and state governments.
This pressure could further encourage adoption of healthcare IT and increase demand for business management, consulting, and managed IT services, as the future success of these healthcare providers is greatly dependent upon their ability to engage patient populations and to coordinate patient care across a multitude of settings, while optimizing operating efficiency along the way.
We have historically made financing arrangements available to clients on a case-by-case basis, depending upon the various aspects of the proposed contract and customer attributes.
Our system sales revenues are now weighted more heavily in the form of financed sales, compared to upfront and subscription payment modules.
These financing arrangements include short-term payment plans and longer-term lease financing through us or third-party financing companies.
During 2018, total financing receivables increased by $7.8 million, which had a significant impact on operating cash flow.
This increase in financing arrangements was primarily due to two reasons.
First, meaningful use stage three ("MU3") installations are primarily financed through short-term payment plans and demand for such installation has increased since late 2017.
Second, competitor financing options, primarily through accounts receivable management collections and cloud EHR arrangements, have applied pressure to reduce initial customer capital investment requirements for new EHR installations, leading to the offering of long-term lease options.
We expect positive cash flows from financing receivables during 2019 as cash receipts from MU3 installations in the previous year are received.
We have also historically made our software applications available to clients through "Software as a Service" or "SaaS" configurations, including our Cloud Electronic Health Record ("Cloud EHR") offering.
We have experienced an increase in the prevalence of such SaaS arrangements for new system installations and add-on sales to existing clients since 2015, a trend we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.
Unlike our perpetual license arrangements under which the related revenue is recognized effectively upon installation, the SaaS arrangements result in revenue being recognized monthly as the services are provided over the term of the arrangement.
As a result, the effect of this trend on the Company's financial statements is reduced system sales revenues during the period of installation in exchange for increased recurring periodic revenues (reflected in system sales and support revenues) over the term of the SaaS arrangement.
On May 3, 2019, the Company closed its acquisition of Get Real Health pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated April 23, 2019, as amended on May 2, 2019.
In addition, during the first six months of 2019, we incurred approximately $0.4 million of pre-tax acquisition costs in connection with the acquisition of Get Real Health.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we generated revenues of $135.3 million from the sale of our products and services, compared to $138.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018, a decrease of 3% that is primarily attributed to fewer MU3 installations as the MU3 deadline approaches partially offset by continued TruBridge client growth.
of TruBridge solutions within our existing EHR client base as our leading performance indicator.
Our net income for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased by $0.8 million to $5.1 million from the six months ended June 30, 2018 as a result of a lower effective tax rate.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $9.6 million to $17.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to more advantageous changes in working capital, most notably as it relates to accounts receivable and financing receivables.
Revenues.
Total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $1.7 million, or 3%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018.
 Recurring system sales and support revenues decreased by $1.5 million, or 4%, compared to the second quarter of 2018.
 Non-recurring system sales and support revenues decreased by $1.6 million, or 17%, primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in Acute Care EHR non-recurring revenues.
We installed our Acute Care EHR solutions at six new hospital clients during the second quarter of 2019 (three of which were under a SaaS arrangement, resulting in revenue being recognized ratably over the contract term) compared to three new hospital clients during the second quarter of 2018 (one under a SaaS arrangement).
Additionally, the impending 2019 year-end deadline for compliance with the related Promoting Interoperability (“PI”, formerly “Meaningful Use”) program from CMS resulted in a $2.7 million decrease in related MU3 installation revenues, which were partially offset by robust sales of other add-on applications.
 TruBridge revenues increased 5%, or $1.4 million, compared to the second quarter of 2018.
Most notably, our insurance services line, which includes our TruBridge services, increased by $0.4 million, or 5%, due to new RCM customer growth.
We have also expanded our customer base for our accounts receivable management services resulting in an increase of $0.6 million, or 7%, and our information technology management services grew by 10%, or $0.3 million.
Get Real Health contributed $0.2 million in TruBridge revenue during the second quarter of 2019.
Costs of Sales.
Total costs of sales decreased by 4%, or $1.4 million, compared to the second quarter of 2018.
As a percentage of total revenues, costs of sales decreased to 48% in the second quarter of 2019, compared to 49% in the second quarter of 2018.
Gross margin on Acute Care EHR system sales and support was flat at 52% in the second quarter of 2019 and 2018.
Decreases in payroll, software, hardware, and other costs combined for the decrease.
The gross margin on Post-acute Care EHR system sales and support increased to 76% in the second quarter of 2019, compared to 72% in the second quarter of 2018.
This increase was partially offset by a decrease in payroll and related costs of 2%, or $0.2 million, as a result of a 3% reduction in headcount compared to the second quarter of 2019.
The gross margin on these services increased to 47% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 46% in the second quarter of 2018.
Get Real Health contributed $0.1 million in TruBridge cost of sales during the second quarter of 2019.
Product Development.
Sales and Marketing.
We also reduced our general spend by $0.3 million, or 24%, compared to the second quarter of 2018.
Get Real Health contributed $0.2 million in sales and marketing costs during the second quarter of 2019.
General and administrative expenses decreased 8%, or $1.1 million, as the $2.1 million in cost savings achieved through recent changes in the health benefits offered to our employees through our self-insured health plans were partially offset by increases in other expense items.
Most notably, we saw a $1.1 million increase in non-recurring severance and transaction-related costs resulting from our recent acquisition of Get Real Health.
Bad debt expense decreased $0.3 million, or 25%, compared to the second quarter of 2018.
Get Real Health contributed $0.2 million in general and administrative costs during the second quarter of 2019.
Amortization expense associated with acquisition-related intangible assets decreased $0.1 million compared to the second quarter of 2018 due to the retirement of Rycan related trademarks during 2018.
All software and services previously provided under the Rycan name now are marketed under TruBridge trademarks.
 Total Operating Expenses.
As a percentage of total revenues, total operating expenses decreased to 47% in the second quarter of 2019, compared to 48% in the second quarter of 2018.
Total Other Income (Expense).
Total other income (expense) decreased from expense of $1.6 million during the second quarter of 2018 to expense of $1.5 million during the second quarter of 2019, as our interest rate on long term debt was reduced as we have reached our target consolidated leverage ratio, coupled with an increase in interest income due to the expansion of long-term payment plans offered to our clients.
As a result of the foregoing factors, income before taxes increased by $1.5 million, compared to the second quarter of 2018.
Net Income.
ended June 30, 2018.
Net income represented 3% of revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to less than 1% of revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Revenues.
Total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $3.5 million, or 3%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018.
 Recurring system sales and support revenues decreased by $2.6 million, or 4%, compared to the first six months of 2018.
We installed our Acute Care EHR solutions at 11 new hospital clients during the first six months of 2019 (four of which were under a SaaS arrangement) compared to nine new hospital clients during the first six months of 2018 (two under a SaaS arrangement).
Despite the similar experience in non-SaaS installation activity, a decrease in average contract value for the related installations resulted in non-recurring EHR revenues from new system implementations decreasing $2.5 million from the first six months of 2018.
Additionally, the impending 2019 year-end deadline for compliance with the related PI (formerly “Meaningful Use”) program from CMS resulted in a $4.7 million decrease in related MU3 installation revenues, which were partially offset by robust sales of other add-on applications.
Non-recurring Post-acute Care EHR revenues increased by $0.9 million, or 54%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 as a result of increased bookings due to our ongoing product releases and aggressive efforts to make technological improvements to the AHT product line.
 TruBridge revenues increased 4%, or $2.1 million, compared to the first six months of 2018.
Most notably, our insurance services line, which includes our TruBridge services, increased by $1.2 million, or 9%, due to new RCM customer growth.
We have also expanded our customer base for our accounts receivable management services, resulting in an increase of $1.0 million, or 6%, and our information technology management services grew by 10%, or $0.6 million.
Get Real Health contributed $0.2 million in TruBridge revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Costs of Sales.
Total costs of sales decreased by 2%, or $1.2 million, compared to the first sixth months of 2018.
As a percentage of total revenues, costs of sales remained at 47% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
This decrease was partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in hardware expense resulting from changes in the sales mix.
The gross margin on Post-acute Care EHR system sales and support increased to 77% in the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared to 71% in the six months ended June 30, 2018.

Product Development.
Product development costs increased 3%, or $0.5 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily as a result of an increase in headcount.
Get Real Health contributed $0.3 million in product development costs during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Sales and Marketing.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased 5%, or $0.7 million, compared to the first six months of 2018, primarily due to decreased payroll costs of 11%, or $0.7 million, based on decreased headcount.
Get Real Health contributed $0.2 million in sales and marketing costs during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Most notably, we saw a $2.1 million increase in non-recurring severance and transaction-related costs resulting from recent acquisition activity and other strategic initiatives.
Lastly, stock compensation expense increased $0.4 million as a result of additional grants of stock-based awards made during the trailing twelve months.
Get Real Health contributed $0.2 million in general and administrative costs during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Amortization expense associated with acquisition-related intangible assets decreased $0.2 million compared to the first six months of 2018 due to the retirement of Rycan related trademarks during 2018.
All software and services previously provided under the Rycan name now are marketed under TruBridge trademarks.
 Total Operating Expenses.
As a percentage of total revenues, total operating expenses remained at 46% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Total Other Income (Expense).
Total other income (expense) decreased from expense of $3.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 to expense of $3.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019, as our interest rate on long term debt was reduced as we have reached our target consolidated leverage ratio, coupled with an increase in interest income due to the expansion of long-term payment plans offered to our clients.
Net Income.
As of June 30, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 million and our remaining borrowing capacity under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility of $11.6 million, compared to $5.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $20.3 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2018.
In conjunction with our acquisition of HHI in January 2016, we entered into the Previous Credit Agreement which provided for the $125 million Previous Term Loan Facility and the $50 million Previous Revolving Credit Facility.
On October 13, 2017, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to refinance and decrease the aggregate principal amount of the credit facilities from $175 million to $162 million, which included the $117 million Amended Term Loan Facility and the $45 million Amended Revolving Credit Facility.
On February 8, 2018, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to increase the aggregate principal amount of the Amended Credit Facilities from $162 million to $167 million, which includes the $117 million Amended Term Loan Facility and a $50 million Amended Revolving Credit Facility.
As of June 30, 2019, we had $130.9 million in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Credit Facilities.
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 million as of June 30, 2019, the future operating cash flows of the combined entity, and our remaining borrowing capacity under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility of $11.6 million as of June 30, 2019, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing cash requirements for the next twelve months.
To finance the closing of the Get Real Health transaction, which occurred on May 3, 2019, the Company used a draw of approximately $11.0 million under its Amended Revolving Credit Facility.
If the Company is required to make earnout payments (up to $14.0 million) after the end of 2019, the Company expects to use additional draws on its Amended Revolving Credit Facility to fund any such earnout payments.
The Company has measured the fair value of the potential earnout payment at $5.0 million as of June 30, 2019.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $9.6 million, from $7.8 million provided by operations for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $17.5 million provided by operations for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
During the first six months 2018, rapid revenue growth for TruBridge resulted in expansion of accounts receivable of approximately $4.5 million and financing receivables of approximately $1.7 million, as we were still in the early-stages of the MU3 opportunity (the sales of which have been nearly all under short-term payment plans).
Conversely, modest TruBridge revenue growth during the first six months 2019 coupled with collections on past financing receivables have greatly abated the related cash collection timing delays.
As a result, these components of working capital, which combined for $6.1 million of cash collection deferrals during the first six months 2018, combined to be $4.0 million cash positive during the first six months 2019.
We completed our $11.0 million acquisition of Get Real Health during the second quarter 2019.
We do not anticipate the need for significant capital expenditures during the remainder of 2019.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, our financing activities used net cash of $4.5 million, as we paid a net $1.4 million in long-term debt principal and declared and paid dividends in the amount of $2.9 million.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we made a $7.0 million prepayment on the Amended Term Loan Facility in accordance with the excess cash flow mandatory prepayment requirements of the Amended Credit Agreement.
We believe that paying dividends is an effective way of providing an investment return to our stockholders and a beneficial use of our cash.
However, the declaration of dividends by CPSI is subject to compliance with the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement and the discretion of our Board of Directors, which may decide to change or terminate the Company's dividend policy at any time.
As of June 30, 2019, we had $92.5 million in principal amount outstanding under the Amended Term Loan Facility and $38.4 million in principal amount outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility.
The applicable margin range for LIBOR loans and the letter of credit fee ranges from 2.0% to 3.5%.
The applicable margin range for base rate loans ranges from 1.0% to 2.5%, in each case based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio.
Principal payments with respect to the Amended Term Loan Facility are due on the last day of each fiscal quarter beginning December 31, 2017, with quarterly principal payments of approximately $1.46 million through September 30, 2019, approximately $2.19 million through September 30, 2021 and approximately $2.93 million through September 30, 2022, with maturity on October 13, 2022 or such earlier date as the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement become due and payable pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement (the "Amended Maturity Date").
Any principal outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is due and payable on the Amended Maturity Date.
The Amended Credit Facilities are secured pursuant to a Pledge and Security Agreement, dated January 8, 2016, among the parties identified as obligors therein and Regions, as collateral agent, on a first priority basis by a security interest in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets (subject to certain exceptions) of the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors (collectively, the “Subsidiary Guarantors”), including certain registered intellectual property and the capital stock of certain of the Company’s direct and indirect subsidiaries.
Our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are also guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors.
The Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to mandatorily prepay the Amended Credit Facilities with (i) 75% of excess cash flow (minus certain specified other payments) during each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and (ii) 50% of excess cash flow (minus certain specified other payments) during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and thereafter.
without penalty, subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to prepayments of LIBOR rate loans made on a day other than the last day of any applicable interest period.
The excess cash flow mandatory prepayment requirement under the Amended Credit Agreement resulted in a $7.0 million prepayment on the Amended Term Loan Facility during the first quarter 2019 related to excess cash flow generated by the Company during 2018.
As of June 30, 2019, we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $17 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $227 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance, Cloud EHR contracts, and TruBridge services.
As of June 30, 2018, we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $38 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $229 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance and TruBridge services.
This lack of urgency has largely been the natural result of the Meaningful Use era reaching the end of its life cycle, resulting in lessened prospective regulatory challenges and general fatigue in our markets towards additional investment in EHR technology.
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified our critical accounting polices related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for credit losses, and estimates.
There have been no significant changes to these critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
