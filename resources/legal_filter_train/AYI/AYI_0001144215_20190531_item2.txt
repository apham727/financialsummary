The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report.
Also, please refer to Acuity Brands' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 25, 2018 (“Form 10-K”).
Acuity Brands is the parent company of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. (“ABL”) and other subsidiaries (Acuity Brands, ABL, and such other subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or similar references).
Our principal office is located in Atlanta, Georgia.
We are one of the world’s leading providers of lighting and building management solutions and services for commercial, institutional, industrial, infrastructure, and residential applications throughout North America and select international markets.
Our lighting and building management solutions include devices such as luminaires, lighting controls, controllers for various building systems, power supplies, prismatic skylights, and drivers, as well as integrated systems designed to optimize energy efficiency and comfort for various indoor and outdoor applications.
Additionally, we continue to expand our solutions portfolio, including software and services, to provide a host of other economic benefits resulting from data analytics that enables the Internet of Things (“IoT”), supports the advancement of smart buildings, smart cities, and the smart grid, and allows businesses to develop custom applications to scale their operations.
As of May 31, 2019, we operate 18 manufacturing facilities and eight distribution facilities along with three warehouses to serve our extensive customer base.
On May 1, 2018, using cash on hand and borrowings available under existing credit arrangements, we acquired IOTA Engineering, LLC (“IOTA”).
IOTA is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona and manufactures highly engineered emergency lighting products and power equipment for commercial and institutional applications both in the U.S. and internationally.
On February 12, 2018, using cash on hand, we acquired Lucid Design Group, Inc (“Lucid”).
Lucid is headquartered in Oakland, California and provides a data and analytics platform to make data-driven decisions to improve building efficiency and drive energy conservation and savings.
No acquisitions were completed during the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
Our principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows generated primarily from our business operations, cash on hand, and various sources of borrowings.
Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase shares, meet obligations as they become due, and maintain compliance with covenants contained in our financing agreements.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we paid $39.8 million for property, plant, and equipment, primarily for new and enhanced information technology capabilities, equipment, tooling, and facility enhancements.
We currently expect to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales in capital expenditures during fiscal 2019.
In March 2018, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the repurchase of up to six million shares of the Company's common stock.
As of May 31, 2019, 1.2 million shares had been repurchased under this authorization, of
which 0.4 million shares were repurchased in fiscal 2019.
Our short-term cash needs are expected to include funding operations as currently planned; making capital investments as currently anticipated; paying quarterly stockholder dividends as currently anticipated; paying principal and interest on debt as currently scheduled, including our senior unsecured notes maturing in December 2019, which we expect to repay with borrowings available under existing credit arrangements; making required contributions to our employee benefit plans; funding possible acquisitions; and potentially repurchasing shares of our outstanding common stock as authorized by the Board.
We believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months based on our cash on hand, current projections of cash flow from operations, and borrowing availability under financing arrangements.
Additionally, we believe that our cash flows from operations and sources of funding, including, but not limited to, future borrowings and capacity, will sufficiently support our long-term liquidity needs.
We use available cash and cash flow from operations, borrowings on credit arrangements, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options to fund operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions if any; to repurchase Company stock; and to pay dividends.
Our cash position at May 31, 2019 was $333.7 million, an increase of $204.6 million from August 31, 2018.
During the nine months ended May 31, 2019, we generated net cash flows from operations of $312.0 million.
We generated $312.0 million of cash flow from operating activities during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared with $299.7 million in the prior-year period, an increase of $12.3 million, due primarily to lower operating working capital requirements.
Operating working capital (calculated by adding accounts receivable plus inventories, and subtracting accounts payable, net of acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes) decreased approximately $21.1 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to a $3.0 million decrease during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 due primarily to greater cash collections from customers year over year as well as fewer inventory purchases, partially offset by the timing of payments for trade payables.
We believe that investing in assets and programs that will over time increase the overall return on our invested capital is a key factor in driving stockholder value.
We expect to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales primarily for new equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology capabilities during fiscal 2019.
Our current capital structure is comprised principally of senior unsecured notes and equity of our stockholders.
Total debt outstanding was $356.6 million and $356.8 million at May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively, and consisted primarily of fixed-rate obligations.
The Unsecured Notes were subsequently exchanged for SEC registered notes with substantially identical terms.
Currently, we plan to refinance the Unsecured Notes in full with borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, of which $341.1 million of the carrying value would be due greater than one year from the anticipated refinancing date.
As such, this amount is reflected within Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2019.
See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
On May 31, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and no borrowings under the Term Loan Facility.
as of May 31, 2019.
At May 31, 2019, we had additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement of $794.7 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility less the outstanding letters of credit of $5.3 million issued on the Revolving Credit Facility.
As of May 31, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $9.5 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under our casualty insurance programs and for providing credit support for our industrial revenue bond, including $5.3 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.
See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
The increase was due primarily to net income earned in the period, partially offset by share repurchases, adjustments related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the payment of dividends, and foreign currency translation adjustments.
Our debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders’ equity) was 15.9% and 17.2% at May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively.
The ratio of debt, net of cash, to total capitalization, net of cash, was 1.2% and 11.7% at May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively.
We paid dividends on our common stock of $15.6 million and $16.2 million ($0.39 per share) during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
All decisions regarding the declaration and payment of dividends are at the discretion of the Board and are evaluated regularly in light of our financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, funding requirements, applicable law, and any other factors the Board deems relevant.
Net sales were $947.6 million for the three months ended May 31, 2019 compared with $944.0 million reported for the three months ended May 31, 2018, an increase of $3.6 million, or 0.4%.
we reported net income of $88.4 million, an increase of $15.4 million, or 21.1%, compared with $73.0 million for the three months ended May 31, 2018.
management solutions, it is not possible to precisely quantify or differentiate the individual components of volume, price, and mix.
Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $5.5 million, or 1.4%, to $383.6 million compared with $389.1 million in the prior-year period.
Gross profit margin decreased 70 basis points to 40.5% for the three months ended May 31, 2019 compared with 41.2% in the prior-year period.
We recognized pre-tax special charge credits of $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with pre-tax special charges of $9.9 million recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Further details regarding our special charges are included in the Special Charge footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 14.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 14.5% for the year-ago period.
Interest expense, net, was $8.3 million and $8.4 million for the three months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We reported net miscellaneous expense of $0.2 million and net miscellaneous income of $0.2 million for the three months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our effective income tax rate was 20.9% and 26.4% for the three months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decline in the current fiscal tax rate reflects a lower federal statutory rate and the recognition of certain research and development cost tax credits, including claims for prior periods, during the current period.
We currently estimate that our blended consolidated effective income tax rate, before any discrete items, will approximate 22% to 24% for fiscal 2019.
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $15.4 million to $88.4 million from $73.0 million reported for the prior-year period.
Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended May 31, 2019 increased $0.42 to $2.22 compared with diluted earnings per share of $1.80 for the prior-year period.
This increase reflects higher net income and a reduced share count.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended May 31, 2019 increased $0.16, or 6.8%, to $2.53 compared with $2.37 for the prior-year period.
Net sales were $2.73 billion for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared with $2.62 billion reported for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, an increase of $115.7 million, or 4.4%.
For the nine months ended May 31, 2019, we reported net income of $234.3 million, a decrease of $7.1 million, or 2.9%, compared with $241.4 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2018.
Fiscal 2019 results were impacted by the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in a decrease to revenues, gross profit, and operating profit of $7.8 million, $3.8 million, and $4.0 million, respectively, during the nine months ended May 31, 2019.
Additionally, fiscal 2018 results were restated to reflect the impact of adopting ASU 2017-07.
Upon adoption of ASU 2017-07, our previously reported operating profit and other expense both increased $4.6 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2018.
The provisions of ASU 2017-07 had no impact to our previously reported net income or earnings per share.
See New Accounting Pronouncements footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased $11.5 million compared to the prior-year period.

Adjusted gross profit for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was $1,087.1 million (39.8% of net sales) compared with $1,077.1 million (41.1% of net sales) in the prior-year period.
We recognized a pre-tax special charge of $1.3 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared with a pre-tax special charge of $10.7 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Further details regarding our special charges are included in the Special Charge footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Adjusted operating profit increased by $3.9 million, or 1.0%, to $382.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared with $378.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Adjusted operating profit margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 decreased 40 basis points to 14.0% compared with 14.4% in the year-ago period.
We reported net miscellaneous expense of $2.6 million and $3.8 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our effective income tax rate was 23.0% and 16.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We currently estimate that our blended consolidated effective income tax rate, before any discrete items, will approximate 22% to 24% for fiscal 2019.
Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 decreased $7.1 million to $234.3 million from $241.4 million reported for the prior-year period.
The decrease in net income resulted primarily from a one-time tax benefit for income taxes related to the TCJA recorded in 2018 that did not recur in the current fiscal year.
nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $0.02 to $5.87 compared with diluted earnings per share of $5.85 for the prior-year period.
This increase reflects higher operating profit and a reduced share count, partially offset by higher net income tax expense.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $0.64, or 10.3%, to $6.83 compared with $6.19 for the prior-year period.
We continue to believe the execution of our strategy will provide attractive opportunities for profitable growth over the long-term.
Our strategy is to capitalize on market growth and share gain opportunities by continuing to expand and leverage our industry-leading lighting and building management solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and financial strength, to produce attractive financial performance over the long-term.
Third-party forecasts and several leading indicators continue to suggest that the North American lighting market, our primary market, will increase in the low-single digit range in calendar 2019, although some leading indicators of future market demand, such as the Architectural Billings Index and the Dodge Momentum Index, have recently softened.
Lastly, we believe our fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin will exceed prior-year’s fourth quarter margin as well as improve on a sequential basis from the third quarter.
These strategies focus on growth opportunities for new construction and renovation projects, expansion into underpenetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the continued introduction of new lighting and building management solutions as part of our integrated, tiered solutions strategy, including leveraging our unique, technology driven solutions portfolio to capture market share in the nascent, but rapidly growing, market for data capture, analytics, and other services, assisting in transforming buildings and campuses from cost centers to strategic assets.
We expect to continue to introduce products and solutions to more effectively compete in these portions of the market and to accelerate programs to reduce product costs in order to maintain our competitiveness and drive improved profitability.
The U.S. federal government has recently imposed tariffs on certain Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on all products imported from Mexico.
We believe that our mitigation activities, including recently announced price increases once fully enacted, will assist to offset the added costs.
During fiscal 2018, we announced the planned consolidation of certain facilities and associated reduction in employee workforce.
We expect to incur additional costs in future periods primarily related to early lease termination and additional relocation costs.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that increased our borrowing capacity under such agreements from $250 million to $800 million.
The increase in borrowing capacity provides us with the resources to support growth opportunities, including acquisitions, accommodate the current stock repurchase program, of which 4.8 million shares remain available for repurchase as of July 2, 2019, and refinance our outstanding senior unsecured notes that mature in late calendar 2019.
