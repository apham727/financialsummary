The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report.
Also, please refer to the Acuity Brands' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 25, 2018 (“Form 10-K”).
Acuity Brands is the parent company of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. (“ABL”) and other subsidiaries (Acuity Brands, ABL, and such other subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or similar references).
Our principal office is located in Atlanta, Georgia.
We are one of the world’s leading providers of lighting and building management solutions and services for commercial, institutional, industrial, infrastructure, and residential applications throughout North America and select international markets.
Our lighting and building management solutions include devices such as luminaires, lighting controls, controllers for various building systems, power supplies, prismatic skylights, and drivers, as well as integrated systems designed to optimize energy efficiency and comfort for various indoor and outdoor applications.
Additionally, we continue to expand our solutions portfolio, including software and services, to provide a host of other economic benefits resulting from data analytics that enables the Internet of Things (“IoT”), supports the advancement of smart buildings, smart cities, and the smart grid, and allows businesses to develop custom applications to scale their operations.
As of November 30, 2018, we operate 19 manufacturing facilities and eight distribution facilities along with three warehouses to serve our extensive customer base.
On May 1, 2018, using cash on hand and borrowings available under existing credit arrangements, we acquired IOTA Engineering, LLC (“IOTA”).
IOTA is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona and manufactures highly engineered emergency lighting products and power equipment for commercial and institutional applications both in the U.S. and internationally.
On February 12, 2018, using cash on hand, we acquired Lucid Design Group, Inc (“Lucid”).
Lucid is headquartered in Oakland, California and provides a data and analytics platform to make data-driven decisions to improve building efficiency and drive energy conservation and savings.
No acquisitions were completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Our principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows generated primarily from our business operations, cash on hand, and various sources of borrowings.
Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase shares, meet obligations as they become due, and maintain compliance with covenants contained in our financing agreements.
We currently expect to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales in capital expenditures during fiscal 2019.
For the first three months of fiscal 2019, $14.0 million was invested, primarily for new and enhanced information technology capabilities, equipment, tooling, and facility enhancements.
In March 2018, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the repurchase of up to six million shares of the Company's common stock.
authorization, of which 0.2 million shares were repurchased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Our short-term cash needs are expected to include funding operations as currently planned, making anticipated capital investments, paying quarterly stockholder dividends as currently anticipated, paying principal and interest on borrowings as currently scheduled, making required contributions to our employee benefit plans, funding possible acquisitions, and potentially repurchasing up to five million shares of our outstanding common stock as authorized by the Board.
We believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months based on our cash on hand, current projections of cash flow from operations, and borrowing availability under financing arrangements.
Additionally, we believe that our cash flows from operations and sources of funding, including, but not limited to, future borrowings and capacity, will sufficiently support our long-term liquidity needs.
We use available cash and cash flow from operations, borrowings on credit arrangements, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options to fund operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions; to repurchase Company stock; and to pay dividends.
Our cash position at November 30, 2018 was $214.8 million, an increase of $85.7 million from August 31, 2018.
During the three months ended November 30, 2018, we generated net cash flows from operations of $131.8 million.
Cash generated from operating activities, as well as cash on-hand, was used during the three months ended November 30, 2018 primarily to repurchase 0.2 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $25.0 million, to fund capital expenditures of $14.0 million, to pay dividends to stockholders of $5.2 million, and to pay withholding taxes on the net settlement of equity awards of $3.9 million.
We generated $131.8 million of cash flow from operating activities during the three months ended November 30, 2018 compared with $139.8 million in the prior-year period, a decrease of $8.0 million, due primarily to the timing of payments for trade payables and accrued expenses, partially offset by the timing of cash collections from customers.
Operating working capital (calculated by adding accounts receivable plus inventories, and subtracting accounts payable-net of acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes) decreased approximately $31.3 million during the first three months of fiscal 2019 compared to a $14.0 million decrease during the first three months of fiscal 2018 due primarily to greater cash collections from customers year over year.
We believe that investing in assets and programs that will over time increase the overall return on its invested capital is a key factor in driving stockholder value.
We invested $14.0 million and $10.3 million in the first three months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily related to investments in new information technology, equipment, tooling, and facility enhancements.
We expect to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales primarily for new equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology capabilities during fiscal 2019.
Our current capital structure is comprised principally of senior unsecured notes and equity of our stockholders.
Total debt outstanding was $356.7 million and $356.8 million at November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018, respectively, and consisted primarily of fixed-rate obligations.
On December 8, 2009, ABL issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes due in fiscal 2020 (the “Unsecured Notes”) in a private placement transaction.
The Unsecured Notes were subsequently exchanged for SEC-registered notes with substantially identical terms.
The Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum and were issued at a price equal to 99.797% of their face value and for a term of ten years.
See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
On June 29, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a $400.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $400.0 million unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (“Term Loan Facility”).
On November 30, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and no borrowings under the Term Loan Facility.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of November 30, 2018.
At November 30, 2018, we had additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement of $794.7 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility less the outstanding letters of credit of $5.3 million issued on the Revolving Credit Facility.
As of November 30, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $9.5 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under our casualty insurance programs and for providing credit support for our industrial revenue bond, including $5.3 million issued under
See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
The increase was due primarily to net income earned in the period, partially offset by share repurchases, adjustments related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), and the payment of dividends.
Our debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders’ equity) was 16.9% and 17.2% at November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018, respectively.
The ratio of debt, net of cash, to total capitalization, net of cash, was 7.5% and 11.7% at November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018, respectively.
We paid dividends on our common stock of $5.2 million and $5.5 million ($0.13 per share) during the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Net sales were $932.6 million for the three months ended November 30, 2018 compared with $842.8 million reported for the three months ended November 30, 2017, an increase of $89.8 million, or 10.7%.
For the three months ended November 30, 2018, we reported net income of $79.6 million, an increase of $8.1 million, or 11.3%, compared with $71.5 million for the three months ended November 30, 2017.
Fiscal 2019 results were impacted by the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in a decrease to revenues, gross profit, and operating profit of $2.4 million, $1.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively, during the three months ended November 30, 2018.
Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $17.6 million, or 5.0%, to $367.5 million compared with $349.9 million in the prior-year period.
Gross profit margin decreased 210 basis points to 39.4% for the three months ended November 30, 2018 compared with 41.5% in the prior-year period.
Adjusted gross profit margin for the three months ended November 30, 2018 declined 200 basis points to 39.5% compared with 41.5% in the prior year period.
We recognized pre-tax special charges of $1.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with pre-tax special charges of $0.2 million recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily related to move costs associated with the previously announced transfer of activities from a planned facility closure.
Adjusted operating profit decreased by $1.4 million, or 1.0%, to $134.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with $135.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Adjusted operating profit margin decreased 170 basis points to 14.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 16.1% for the year-ago period.
Interest expense, net, was $8.7 million and $8.1 million for the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We reported net miscellaneous expense of $1.3 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our effective income tax rate was 25.2% and 35.5% for the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $8.1 million to $79.6 million from $71.5 million reported for the prior-year period.
The increase in net income resulted primarily from a lower provision for income taxes, partially offset by decreased operating profit.
Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2018 increased $0.28 to $1.98 compared with diluted earnings per share of $1.70 for the prior-year period.
This increase reflects higher net income as well as lower average shares outstanding due to repurchases of the Company's stock during the prior twelve-month period.
Adjusted net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $92.8 million compared with $81.5 million in the prior-year period, which represented an increase of $11.3 million, or 13.9%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2018 increased $0.38, or 19.6%, to $2.32 compared with $1.94 for the prior-year period.
We continue to believe the execution of our strategy will provide attractive opportunities for profitable growth over the long-term.
Third-party forecasts and leading indicators suggest that the North American lighting market, our primary market, will increase in the low-single digit range in fiscal 2019.
We expect to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets that we serve by executing strategies focused on growth opportunities for new construction and renovation projects, expansion into underpenetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the continued introduction of new lighting and building management solutions as part of our integrated, tiered solutions strategy, including leveraging our unique, technology driven solutions portfolio to capture market share in the nascent, but rapidly growing, market for data capture, analytics, and other services, assisting in transforming buildings and campuses from cost centers to strategic assets.
The U.S. federal government has recently imposed tariffs on certain Chinese imports.
We believe that our mitigation activities, including recently announced price increases once fully enacted, will assist to offset the added costs.
During fiscal 2018, we announced the planned consolidation of certain facilities and associated reduction in employee workforce.
Annual savings realized from the streamlining activities, once fully completed, are expected to exceed the amount of the special charges recognized.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that increased our borrowing capacity under such agreements from $250 million to $800 million.
The increase in borrowing capacity provides us with the resources to support growth opportunities, including acquisitions, and accommodate the current stock repurchase program, of which 4.8 million shares remain available for repurchase as of January 9, 2019.
