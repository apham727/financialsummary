(“Acuity Brands”) and its subsidiaries as of November 30, 2017 and for the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report.
Also, please refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 26, 2017 (“Form 10-K”).
Acuity Brands is the parent company of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. (“ABL”) and other subsidiaries (Acuity Brands, ABL, and such other subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the “Company”).
The Company is one of the world’s leading providers of lighting and building management solutions and services for commercial, institutional, industrial, infrastructure, and residential applications throughout North America and select international markets.
The Company’s lighting and building management solutions include devices such as luminaires, lighting controls, controllers for various building systems, power supplies, prismatic skylights, and drivers, as well as integrated systems designed to optimize energy efficiency and comfort for various indoor and outdoor applications.
Additionally, the Company continues to expand its solutions portfolio to provide a host of other economic benefits, including software and services that enable the Internet of Things (“IoT”).
The Company's IoT solutions provide customers with access to robust data analytics; support the advancement of smart buildings, smart cities, and the smart grid; and allow businesses to develop custom applications to scale their operations.
As of November 30, 2017, the Company operates 19 manufacturing facilities and seven distribution facilities along with one warehouse to serve its extensive customer base.
The Company does not consider acquisitions a critical element of its strategy but seeks opportunities to expand and enhance its portfolio of solutions.
No acquisitions were completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017.
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows generated primarily from its business operations, cash on hand, and various sources of borrowings.
The ability of the Company to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to fund its operations and capital expenditures, pay dividends, meet its obligations as they become due, and maintain compliance with covenants contained in its financing agreements.
Based on its cash on hand, availability under existing financing arrangements, and current projections of cash flow from operations, the Company believes that it will be able to meet its liquidity needs over the next 12 months.
The Company's short-term needs are expected to include funding operations as currently planned, making anticipated capital investments, paying quarterly stockholder dividends as currently anticipated, paying principal and interest on borrowings as currently scheduled, making required contributions to its employee benefit plans, funding potential acquisitions, and potentially repurchasing shares of its outstanding common stock as authorized by the Board of Directors (the “Board”).
The Company expects to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.
No shares have been purchased under this plan as of November 30, 2017.
During fiscal 2018, the Company currently expects to invest approximately two percent of net sales, of which $10.3 million had been invested as of November 30, 2017, in capital expenditures primarily for equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and new and enhanced information technology capabilities.
Additionally, management believes that the Company’s cash flows from operations and sources of funding, including, but not limited to, borrowing capacity, will sufficiently support the long-term liquidity needs of the Company.
The Company uses available cash and cash flow from operations, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options, to fund operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, repurchase Company stock, and pay dividends.
The Company’s cash position at November 30, 2017 was $428.6 million, an increase of $117.5 million from August 31, 2017.
During the three months ended November 30, 2017, the Company generated net cash flows from operations of $139.8 million.
Cash generated from operating activities, as well as cash on-hand, was used during the current period primarily to fund capital expenditures of $10.3 million, to pay employee taxes on net settlement of equity awards of $6.0 million, and to pay dividends to stockholders of $5.5 million.
The Company generated $139.8 million of cash flow from operating activities during the three months ended November 30, 2017 compared with $55.8 million in the prior-year period, an increase of $84.0 million, due primarily to lower operating working capital requirements, the timing of payments for income taxes, and lower variable incentive compensation payments for prior year performance.
Operating working capital (calculated by adding accounts receivable plus inventories, and subtracting accounts payable-net of acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes) decreased approximately $14.0 million during the first three months of fiscal 2018 compared to a $0.1 million increase during the first three months of fiscal 2017.
Management believes that investing in assets and programs that will over time increase the overall return on its invested capital is a key factor in driving stockholder value.
As noted above, the Company expects to invest approximately two percent of net sales primarily for new equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology capabilities during fiscal 2018.
The current capital structure of the Company is comprised principally of senior unsecured notes and equity of its stockholders.
Total debt outstanding was $356.9 million at November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of fixed-rate obligations.
The Unsecured Notes were subsequently exchanged for SEC-registered notes with substantially identical terms.
See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
On August 27, 2014, the Company executed a revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) with a borrowing capacity of $250.0 million.
The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on August 27, 2019.
See the Debt footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
The increase was due primarily to net income earned in the period, stock issuances resulting primarily from the exercise of stock options, and amortization of pension plan prior service costs and actuarial losses, partially offset by the payment of dividends, and foreign currency translation adjustments.
The Company’s debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders’ equity) was 17.1% and 17.6% at November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, respectively.
The ratio of debt, net of cash, to total capitalization, net of cash, was (4.3)% at November 30, 2017 and 2.7% at August 31, 2017.
Acuity Brands paid dividends on its common stock of $5.5 million and $5.8 million ($0.13 per share) during the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Net sales were $842.8 million for the three months ended November 30, 2017 compared with $851.2 million reported for the three months ended November 30, 2016, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 1.0%.
For the three months ended November 30, 2017, the Company reported net income of $71.5 million, a decrease of $10.2 million, or 12.5%, compared with $81.7 million for the three months ended November 30, 2016.
The Company recognized pre-tax special charges related to prior fiscal year actions of $0.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with pre-tax special charges of $1.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Further details regarding the Company's special charges are included in the Special Charge footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2017 decreased $0.06, or 3.0%, to $1.94 compared with $2.00 for the prior-year period.
Management believes that the execution of the Company's strategy will provide opportunities for continued profitable growth.
The Company's strategy is to capitalize on market growth opportunities by continuing to expand and leverage its industry-leading lighting and building management solutions portfolio combined with its extensive market presence and financial strength.
Management expects the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) that was passed on December 22, 2017, to favorably impact the Company’s net income, diluted earnings per share, and cash flows in future periods, due primarily to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for periods beginning January 1, 2018.
Additionally, positive business sentiment and other favorable aspects of the new tax law could incentivize additional investments in facilities and infrastructure in the U.S. that may increase future demand in the end-markets that the Company serves.
Management currently estimates that the Company’s blended consolidated effective income tax rate (“tax rate”) for full-year fiscal 2018 will approximate 26 to 28% before discrete items, compared with nearly 35% for the prior year.
Management also anticipates that the tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 will be significantly lower than the estimated full-year blended tax rate to cumulatively adjust for the 35.5% tax rate recorded for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Management currently estimates that the fiscal 2019 tax rate will approximate 23 to 25% before discrete items.
contingency options under various policy scenarios, it is too early to comment or speculate at this time on the potential ramification of these endless scenarios.
Management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the Company’s Audit Committee of the Board.
There have been no material changes in the Company’s critical accounting estimates during the current period.

Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect any events or circumstances after the date of this annual report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
