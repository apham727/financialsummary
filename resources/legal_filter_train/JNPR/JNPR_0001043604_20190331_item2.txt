We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by applicable law.
The following discussion is based upon our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item I, of this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.
In making these decisions, we consider various factors, including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives.
Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period.
To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this Report, we have provided an executive overview, which includes a summary of our business and market environment along with a financial results and key performance metrics overview.
Juniper designs, develops, and sells products and services for high-performance networks to enable customers to build scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility and improved operating efficiency through automation.
Further, our intent is to expand our software business by introducing new software solutions to our product portfolio that simplify the operation of networks, and allow our customers across our key verticals flexibility in consumption and deployment.
We believe our software revenues as a percentage of total revenues will increase over time as we introduce new software product offerings and business models designed to better monetize the value of our software offerings.
We believe the network needs for our customers in our Cloud, Service Provider, and Enterprise verticals are converging, as these customers recognize the need for high performance networks and are adopting cloud architectures for their infrastructure and service delivery, such as large public and private data centers and service provider edge data centers, for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency.
We remain confident in our strategy and we are executing against our innovation roadmap, as each of our industry verticals transitions to cloud architectures.
In the first quarter of 2019, we continued to execute on our product and solutions strategy and announced new metro, edge and core innovations to accelerate service providers’ 5G transformation.
We announced a new edge MPC11E line card in the MX2000 Series 5G Universal Routing Platform, delivering an increase in line card and system capacity using our Penta Silicon chip.
We also announced our new Triton Silicon enabling end-to-end secure connectivity at scale with 400 gigabit-Ethernet, or GbE, native Media Access Control Security that will be used in the PTX10008 and PTX10016 Universal Chassis.
On April 1, 2019, we acquired Mist Systems, Inc., or Mist, a software company that provides cloud-managed wireless networks powered by artificial intelligence.
We believe that the acquisition of Mist will enhance our enterprise networking portfolio by combining Mist’s next-generation Wireless LAN platform with our wired LAN, SD-WAN, and security solutions to deliver end-to-end user and IT experiences.
In the first quarter of 2019, we continued to experience weakness within our Cloud and Service provider verticals.
In our Cloud vertical, the pace of deployments in a portion of our Cloud customer’s networks has been slower than expected.
Nevertheless, we are focused on the Cloud vertical as well as the transition to 400-gig Ethernet, or 400G, which we believe will present further opportunities for Juniper across our portfolio as our Cloud customers value high-performance, highly compact, power efficient infrastructures, which we support and continue to develop.
Of our top ten customers for the first quarter of 2019, three were Cloud, six were Service Provider, and one was in Enterprise.
Of these customers, four were located outside of the U.S.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions.
Product net revenues decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to Cloud and Service Provider, impacting switching and routing.
The decrease in product revenues was partially offset by growth in Enterprise.
While Cloud capacity continued to grow year-over-year, the growth in units was not enough to offset the decline in ASP.
The decline in our Service Provider business resulted in lower net revenues from our MX, PTX, and QFX product families.
The decline was partially offset by revenue growth in Enterprise routing.
Given the strength in our Enterprise vertical, strong customer interest in our new platforms, such as Contrail Enterprise Multicloud, MX 204 and MX10003, and the investments we are making in our enterprise sales strategy, we believe our Enterprise vertical will continue to contribute to revenue growth in 2019.
We also saw strength in APAC driven by the aforementioned revenue growth in Enterprise, resulting from our solutions based sales strategy to enable the Telco Cloud transformation and enterprise multicloud initiatives.
We expect to return to year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Service net revenues increased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, due to strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts.
Additionally, we saw year-over-year services revenue growth in EMEA and Americas.
For example, the United States imposed a tariff on networking products imported from China, which includes certain products that we import into and sell within the United States.
These import tariffs did not have a significant impact to our gross margins during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues decreased slightly during the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower revenue, partially offset by growth in our software revenue.
Service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower service delivery costs and a one-time recovery of goods and services tax.
Subsequent to March 31, 2019, we amended the 2019 Restructuring Plan to implement certain additional organizational changes resulting in a realignment of our workforce.
As a result, we expect to record severance charges of approximately $6.0 million to $7.5 million related to headcount reductions in the second quarter of 2019.
Total other income (expense), net increased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in interest income related to our fixed income investment portfolio, as a result of higher yields.
The effective tax rate increased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to a change in the level of discrete items in the comparative period.
On July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, or the Court, issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement to share expenses related to share-based compensation.
Had the Ninth Circuit not withdrawn its opinion, our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 would have been higher.
As a result of recommendations by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, certain countries in EMEA and APAC have either enacted new corporate tax legislation or are considering enacting such legislation in the near future.
We expect the effect of these reform measures to potentially impact long-standing tax principles, particularly in regard to transfer pricing.
The decrease was primarily due to lower cash collections from customers as a result of lower invoicing, partially offset by a decrease in cash payments to suppliers.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, net proceeds from sales, maturities and redemptions of investments was $1,175.3 million, primarily from the liquidation of repatriated offshore investments to fund the accelerated share repurchase program ("2018 ASR") discussed below.
Net cash used in financing activities decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018.
The decrease was primarily due to the payment of $750.0 million pursuant to the 2018 ASR during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as described further below, partially offset by the payment of $350.0 million for our Senior Notes that matured during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
As part of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program in February 2018, we entered into the 2018 ASR to repurchase $750.0 million of our common stock.
We made an up-front payment of $750.0 million pursuant to the 2018 ASR to repurchase our common stock.
The aggregate number of shares ultimately repurchased of 29.3 million shares of common stock was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount, of $25.62 per share.
As of March 31, 2019, there was $1.3 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
On April 29, 2019, we entered into a new accelerated share repurchase program (the "2019 ASR") with a financial institution, to repurchase an aggregate of approximately $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock.
We made an up-front payment of $300.0 million pursuant to the 2019 ASR and received and retired an initial 8.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $240.0 million based on the market value of our common stock on the date of the transaction.
Future share repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements.
See Note 8, Equity, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report for further discussion of our share purchase program.
We declared and paid cash dividends of $0.19 per share, totaling $66.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by the Board or an authorized committee thereof.
See Note 14, Subsequent Event, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report for discussion of our dividend declaration subsequent to March 31, 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, we had an unsecured revolving credit facility that was due to expire in June 2019 (the “Prior Revolving Credit Facility”), which enabled borrowings of up to $500.0 million, with the option, subject to the lenders' approval, to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $200.0 million.
In April 2019, we entered into a new credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five-year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), with an option to increase the Revolving Credit Facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, subject to the lenders' approval.
The Prior Revolving Credit Facility was terminated substantially concurrently with our entering into the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate in April 2024, subject to two one-year maturity extension options, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility.
Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term, and long-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations; planned stock repurchases and dividends; capital expenditures; commitments and other liquidity requirements; and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, there were no share repurchases under our Board approved 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, which authorized us to purchase an aggregate of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock.
Future share repurchases will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, including Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
This program may be discontinued at any time.
