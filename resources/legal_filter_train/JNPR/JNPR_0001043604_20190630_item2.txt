Juniper designs, develops, and sells products and services for high-performance networks to enable customers to build scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility and improved operating efficiency through automation. 
Further, our intent is to expand our software business by introducing new software solutions to our product portfolio that simplify the operation of networks, and allow our customers across our key verticals flexibility in consumption and deployment. We believe our software revenues as a percentage of total revenues will increase over time as we introduce new software product offerings and business models designed to better monetize the value of our software offerings. 
We believe the network needs for our customers in our Cloud, Service Provider, and Enterprise verticals are converging, as these customers recognize the need for high performance networks and are adopting cloud architectures for their infrastructure and service delivery, such as large public and private data centers and service provider edge data centers, for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency. 
We remain confident in our strategy and we are executing against our innovation roadmap, as each of our industry verticals transitions to cloud architectures. We believe our understanding of high-performance networking technology and cloud architecture and our strategy position us to capitalize on the industry transition to more automated, cost-efficient, scalable networks.
In the second quarter of 2019, we continued to execute on our product and solutions strategy and announced a cloud-managed version of our SD-WAN solution. Our Contrail Service Orchestration now gives enterprises a simple way to manage and secure the WAN infrastructure and Branch LAN and Wi-Fi networks. During the quarter we released our PTX10003 router that is 400-gig Ethernet, or 400G, ready, and our QFX5220 switch.
On April 1, 2019, we acquired Mist Systems, Inc., or Mist, a company that provides cloud-managed wireless networks powered by artificial intelligence. We believe that the acquisition of Mist will enhance our enterprise networking portfolio by combining Mist’s next-generation Wireless local area network platform, or WLAN, with our wired LAN, software-defined wide area network solution, or SD-WAN, and security solutions to deliver integrated end-to-end user and information technology, or IT, experiences. 
In the second quarter of 2019, we experienced weakness within our Service Provider vertical due to timing of deployments, but we believe our relationships remain strong. With the availability of our new MX 5G line cards, our Contrail Orchestration platform and our partnership with Ericsson, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on our Service Provider customers' 5G and other Telco product initiatives. We expect Service Provider to be down in the year 2019 as compared to 2018.
In the second quarter of 2019, Enterprise decreased primarily due to timing of our customers' deployment cycle.
In the second quarter of 2019, we experienced improved trends within our Cloud vertical primarily due to an acceleration of certain wide area deployments, which had previously been proceeding at a slower rate. In the near-term, Cloud deployment cycles remain difficult to predict.
Of our top ten customers for the second quarter of 2019, four were Cloud, five were Service Provider, and one was in Enterprise. Of these customers, three were located outside of the U.S.

On July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, or the Court, issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement to share expenses related to share-based compensation. On August 7, 2018, the Court withdrew its opinion to allow time for a reconstituted panel to confer. On June 7, 2019, the Court upheld the cost-sharing regulations, subject to the right of appeal by Altera. On July 22, 2019, Altera petitioned the Court for rehearing. We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our financial statements. If a judicial decision against Altera had been finalized in the reporting period, our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 would have been higher.
Net cash provided by operations decreased during the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash collections from customers as a result of lower invoicing, partially offset by a decrease in cash payments to suppliers.
In January 2018, our Board of Directors, which we refer to as the Board, approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which we refer to as the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. As part of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program in February 2018, we entered into the 2018 ASR to repurchase $750.0 million of our common stock. We made an up-front payment of $750.0 million pursuant to the 2018 ASR to repurchase our common stock. The aggregate number of shares ultimately repurchased of 29.3 million shares of common stock was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount, of $25.62 per share.
On April 29, 2019, we entered into the 2019 ASR, to repurchase an aggregate of approximately $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock. We made an up-front payment of $300.0 million pursuant to the 2019 ASR and received and retired an initial 8.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $240.0 million based on the market value of our common stock on the date of the transaction. 
As of June 30, 2019, there was approximately $1.0 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. 
Future share repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. Our 2018 Stock Repurchase Program may be discontinued at any time. See Note 10, Equity, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report for further discussion of our share purchase program. 
We declared and paid cash dividends of $0.19 per share, totaling $65.5 million and $131.7 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. Any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by the Board or an authorized committee thereof. See Note 16, Subsequent Event, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report for discussion of our dividend declaration subsequent to June 30, 2019. 
In April 2019, we entered into a new credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five-year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), with an option to increase the Revolving Credit Facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, subject to the lenders' approval. The Prior Revolving Credit Facility was terminated substantially concurrently with our entering into the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate in April 2024, subject to two one-year maturity extension options, on the terms and conditions as set forth in the credit agreement. As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement, and no amounts were outstanding.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
As part of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, on April 29, 2019, we entered into the 2019 ASR to repurchase an aggregate of approximately $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the ASR, we made an up-front payment of $300.0 million pursuant to the ASR and received and retired an initial 8.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $240.0 million, based on the market price of $27.94 per share of our common stock on the date of the transaction. The initial shares received by us were retired, accounted for as a reduction to stockholder’s equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share. The forward contract for the remaining $60.0 million is considered indexed to the Company's common stock and met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification. For further explanation of our ASR, see Note 10, Equity, in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report.
