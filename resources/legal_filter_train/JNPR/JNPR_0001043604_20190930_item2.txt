We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by applicable law.
The following discussion is based upon our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item I, of this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.
In making these decisions, we consider various factors, including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives.
Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period.
To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this Report, we have provided an executive overview, which includes a summary of our business and market environment along with a financial results and key performance metrics overview.
Juniper designs, develops, and sells products and services for high-performance networks to enable customers to build scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility and improved operating efficiency through automation.
Further, our intent is to expand our software business by introducing new software solutions to our product portfolio that simplify the operation of networks, and allow our customers across our key verticals flexibility in consumption and deployment.
We believe the network needs for our customers in our Cloud, Service Provider, and Enterprise verticals are converging, as these customers recognize the need for high performance networks and are adopting cloud architectures for their infrastructure and service delivery, such as large public and private data centers and service provider edge data centers, for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency.
We remain confident in our strategy and we are executing against our innovation roadmap, as each of our industry verticals transitions to cloud architectures.
In the third quarter of 2019, we experienced weakness within our Service Provider vertical, which we believe is due to continued business challenges facing some of our largest Service Provider customers.
Enterprise has increased sequentially over the past two quarters driven by demand in our U.S. federal business as well as broad Enterprise strength, and we expect another sequential increase in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Our Cloud vertical has returned to year-over-year growth for the past two quarters and we expect our Cloud vertical to grow in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the same quarter in 2018, as we continued to see momentum within our customers' wide area networks, particularly from certain of our switching products.
Of our top ten customers for the third quarter of 2019, three were in Cloud, six were in Service Provider, and one was in Enterprise.
Of these customers, three were located outside of the U.S.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions.

Routing revenue decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in our Service Provider vertical resulting from lower net revenues from our MX product family.
Switching revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily resulting from higher net revenues from our QFX product family in our Cloud vertical, partially offset by lower net revenues from our EX product family.
Security revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily driven by Enterprise, and to a lesser extent, Service Provider.
Service net revenues increased slightly during the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018.
Product net revenues decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to Service Provider and Cloud, impacting routing and switching.
Routing revenue decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in our Service Provider and Cloud verticals resulting from lower net revenues from our MX product family, partially offset by Enterprise.
Switching revenue decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to a decrease, in the first half of 2019, across all verticals resulting in lower net revenues from our QFX and EX product families.
Security revenue increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily driven by Service Provider, and to a lesser extent, Enterprise.
Service net revenues increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, due to strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts.
For example, the United States imposed a tariff on networking products imported from China, which includes certain products that we import into and sell within the United States.
Product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the recent acquisition of Mist, lower revenues and to a lesser extent, China tariffs.
Service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased during the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower service delivery costs and higher revenue.
Product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the recent acquisition of Mist, lower revenues and to a lesser extent, China tariffs.
Service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower service delivery costs and higher revenue.
Total other expense, net increased during the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt.
Total other expense, net decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in interest income related to our fixed income investment portfolio, as a result of higher yields, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt.
The effective tax rate increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same periods in 2018, primarily due to a change in the level of discrete items in the comparative period.
On July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, or the Court, issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement to share expenses related to share-based compensation.
On June 7, 2019, the Court upheld the cost-sharing regulations, subject to the right of appeal by Altera.
On July 22, 2019, Altera petitioned the Court for rehearing.
If a judicial decision against Altera had been finalized in the reporting period, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 would have been higher.
As a result of recommendations by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, certain countries have either enacted new corporate tax legislation or are considering enacting such legislation in the near future.
We expect the effect of these reform measures to potentially impact long-standing tax principles, particularly in regard to transfer pricing.
The decrease was primarily due to lower cash collections from customers as a result of lower invoicing, partially offset by a decrease in cash payments to suppliers.
