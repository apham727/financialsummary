control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
