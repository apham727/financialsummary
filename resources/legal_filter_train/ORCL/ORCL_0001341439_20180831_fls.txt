This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive in nature, or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or otherwise contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events.
Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors” included in documents we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2018 and our other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed by us in our fiscal year 2019, which runs from June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019.
We have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or risks, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.
If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.
New information, future events or risks could cause the forward-looking events we discuss in this Quarterly Report not to occur.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our expectations only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.
