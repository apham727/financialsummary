•Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our cash flows and a discussion of our liquidity and financial condition.
•Contractual and Other Obligations. An overview of contractual obligations, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan contributions, cost-saving plans, uncertain tax positions and off-balance sheet arrangements of our operations.
•In Personal Systems, our strategic focus is on profitable growth through hyper market segmentation with respect to enhanced innovation in multi-operating systems, multi-architecture, geography, customer segments and other key attributes. Additionally, we are investing in premium and mobility form factors such as convertible notebooks, detachable notebooks, and mobility devices in order to meet customer preference for mobile, thinner and lighter devices. The beginning of a market shift to contractual solutions includes an increased focus on Device as a Service. We believe that we are well positioned due to our competitive product lineup.
•In Printing, our strategic focus is on business printing, a shift to contractual solutions and Graphics, as well as expanding our footprint in the 3D printing marketplace. Business printing includes delivering solutions to SMBs and enterprise customers, such as multi-function and PageWide printers, including our JetIntelligence lineup of LaserJet printers. The shift to contractual solutions includes an increased focus on Managed Print Services and Instant Ink, which presents strong after-market supplies opportunities. In the Graphics space, we are focused on innovations such as our Indigo and Latex product offerings. We plan to continue to focus on shifting the mix in the installed base to higher value units and expanding our innovative Ink, Laser, Graphics and 3D printing programs. We continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on high-value products targeted at high usage categories and introducing new revenue delivery models. Our focus is on placing higher value printer units which offer strong annuity of toner and ink, the design and deployment of A3 products and solutions, accelerating growth in Graphic solutions and 3D printing.
A second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution.
To address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners. In addition, we need to continue to improve our operations, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes and efficiencies. We also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models, align our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improve channel execution, strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, and develop and capitalize on market opportunities. 
We typically experience higher net revenues in our first and fourth quarters compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Historical seasonal patterns should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net revenues or financial performance.
In December 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB No. 118, which addresses how a company recognizes provisional estimates when a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes in the TCJA. The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year. The final impact of the TCJA may differ from the provisional estimates due to changes in interpretations of the TCJA, and legislative action to address questions that arise because of the TCJA, by changes in accounting standard for income taxes and related interpretations in response to the TCJA, and updates or changes to estimates used in the provisional amounts. We have determined that the $5.5 billion net benefit from the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, $3.2 billion of tax expense for the one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the $1.2 billion of tax expense for deferred tax asset re-measurement were each provisional amounts and reasonable estimates as of January 31, 2018. Resolution of the provisional estimates of the TCJA effects that are different from the assumptions made by us could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.
For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements see Note 1, “Basis of Presentation”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018, total net revenue increased 14% (increased 13% on a constant currency basis) as compared to the prior-year period. U.S. net revenue increased 9% to $5.0 billion, while net revenue from international operations increased 17% to $9.5 billion. The increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in Notebooks, Desktops and Supplies revenue and favorable foreign currency impacts. 
A detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included in “Segment Information” below.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018, our gross margin increased 0.1 percentage points, as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by improved rate in Printing due to productivity improvements, partially offset by higher commodity costs in Personal Systems.
A detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under “Segment Information” below.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased 14.9% for the three months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by the acquisition of Samsung’s printer business and incremental go-to-market investments to support revenue growth.
Restructuring and other charges for the three months ended January 31, 2018 relate primarily to the Fiscal 2017 Plan and certain non-recurring costs, including those as a result of the Separation.
Interest and other, net expense decreased by $13 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to the prior-year period, partially due to lower foreign currency transaction losses. 
A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 2, “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.
 Effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2018, HP implemented an organizational change to align its segment and business unit financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. The organizational change resulted in the transfer of long-life consumables from Commercial to Supplies within the Printing segment. Certain revenues related to service arrangements, which are being eliminated for the purposes of reporting HP’s consolidated net revenue, have now been reclassified from Other to segments. HP has reflected this change to its segment and business unit information in prior reporting periods on an as-if basis. The reporting change had no impact on previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share.
Personal Systems net revenue increased 14.9% (increased 13.0% on a constant currency basis) for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to the prior-year period. The net revenue increase was primarily due to growth in Notebooks, Desktops and Workstations and favorable foreign currency impacts. The net revenue increase was driven by a 7.3% increase in unit volume combined with a 7.1% increase in average selling prices (“ASPs”) as compared to the prior-year period. The increase in unit volume was primarily due to growth in Notebooks and Desktops. The increase in ASPs was due to favorable pricing rate, foreign currency impacts and positive mix shifts.
Consumer revenue increased 12.6% for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to the prior-year period, driven by growth in Notebooks and Desktops as a result of higher unit volume combined with higher ASPs. Commercial revenue increased 16.2% as compared to the prior-year period, driven by growth in Notebooks, Desktops and Workstations. 
Personal Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.2 percentage points for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in gross margin partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in commodity cost partially offset by higher ASPs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased primarily due to operating expense management.
Printing net revenue increased 13.7% (increased 12.4% on a constant currency basis) for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase in net revenue was driven by increases in both Supplies and Hardware revenue, and favorable foreign currency impacts. Net revenue for Supplies increased 10.4% as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the acquisition of Samsung’s printer business. Printer unit volume increased 14.2% while ASPs increased 6.2% as compared to the prior-year period. The increase in printer unit volume was primarily driven by unit increases in Consumer and Commercial Hardware, including the Samsung-branded printers. Printer ASPs increased primarily due to a mix shift to higher-end printers and favorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by the dilution impact from Samsung-branded low-end A4 products.
Net revenue for Commercial Hardware increased by 27.5% as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to revenue from Samsung-branded printers (net of 25% SKU reductions for the three months ended January 31, 2018), A3 LaserJet and PageWide printers.
Net revenue for Consumer Hardware increased 11.0% as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to a 6.9% increase in printer unit volume and a 5.0% increase in ASPs. The unit volume increase was primarily driven by the Inkjet Home business. The increase in ASPs was primarily driven by better discount management, mix shift to higher-end printers and favorable foreign currency impacts.
Printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.2 percentage points for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by improved gross margin. The gross margin increase was primarily driven by operational improvements and favorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by lower Supplies mix. Operating expenses increased primarily driven by the acquisition of Samsung’s printer business and increases in investments in key growth initiatives and go-to-market.
The loss from operations in Corporate Investments for the three months ended January 31, 2018 was primarily due to expenses associated with our incubation projects.
We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, maturing debt, income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends, in addition to investments and share repurchases. We are able to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. While our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions, our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 and the market risks identified in the section entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 3 of Part I of this report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with the majority of those amounts held outside of the United States. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. Our cash position remains strong, and we expect that our cash balances, anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected near-term cash outlays.
Amounts held outside of the United States are generally utilized to support non-U.S. liquidity needs, although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to short-term intercompany loans into the United States. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds or restrict repatriation of earnings, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the United States and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings or both. The TCJA made significant changes to the U.S. tax law, including a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings. The payments associated with this one-time transition tax will be paid over eight years beginning 2019. We expect a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to U.S. income tax consequences upon a subsequent repatriation to the United States as a result of the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings. However, a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign income tax or withholding tax consequences upon repatriation. As we evaluate the impact of the TCJA and the future cash needs of our operations, we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds, including reducing our gross debt level, returning capital to shareholders with a focus on incremental share repurchase or other uses. 
DSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average net revenue. The increase in DSO was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts and revenue linearity.
DPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average cost of revenue. The increase in DPO was primarily due to higher inventory purchasing volume.
We maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital and targeted capital structure. Outstanding borrowings increased to $7.9 billion as of January 31, 2018 as compared to $7.8 billion as of October 31, 2017, bearing weighted-average interest rates of 4.1% and 4.0% for January 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017, respectively. 
Our weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the impact of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 9, “Financial Instruments”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
We increased our issuance authorization under our commercial paper program from $4.0 billion to $6.0 billion in November 2017. In December 2017, we also entered into an additional revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that provides us with $1.5 billion of available borrowing until November 30, 2018.
For more information on our borrowings, see Note 10, “Borrowings”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
As of January 31, 2018, we anticipate making contributions for the remainder of fiscal year 2018 of approximately $13 million to our non-U.S. pension plans, $23 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified pension plan participants and $6 million to cover benefit claims for our post-retirement benefit plans. Our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government, funding and taxing authorities. For more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
We expect to make future cash payments of approximately $190 million in connection with our cost savings plans through fiscal year 2019. For more information on our restructuring activities that are part of our cost improvements, see Note 3, “Restructuring and Other Charges”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
The TCJA made significant changes to U.S. tax law resulting in a one-time gross transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings of $3.2 billion. We expect the actual cash payments for the tax to be much lower as we expect to reduce the overall liability by more than half once existing and future credits and other balance sheet attributes are used.
As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
We have third-party short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. For more information on our third-party short-term financing arrangements, see Note 7, “Supplementary Financial Information”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
On October 10, 2016, HP’s Board of Directors authorized $3.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. HP intends to use repurchases from time to time to offset the dilution created by shares issued under 
employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. All share repurchases settled in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 were open market transactions. As of January 31, 2018, HP had approximately $2.0 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorizations.
