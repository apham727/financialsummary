Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to our Financial Statements for further detail regarding the adoption of ASC 842.
Stock-based compensation included in the table above excludes amounts that have been recorded in restructuring and reorganization charges.
Revenues.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $244.8 million, a 21% increase when compared to revenues of $201.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisitions of Forte on October 1, 2018 and Business Ink on February 28, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was $32.1 million, or a 13.1% operating margin percentage, compared to $25.8 million, or a 12.8% operating margin percentage for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in operating income is primarily a result of the higher revenues generated in the first quarter of 2019, as reflected by our relatively consistent operating margin percentage.
Diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2019 was $0.59 compared to $0.42 for the first quarter of 2018, reflective of the higher operating income for the first quarter of 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $141.9 million, as compared to $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
Our cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of 2019 were $12.8 million.
See the Liquidity section below for further discussion of our cash flows.
Client Concentration.
A large percentage of our historical revenues have been generated from our two largest clients, which are Comcast and Charter Corporation Inc. (“Charter”).
See our 2018 10-K for additional discussion of our business relationships and contractual terms with Comcast and Charter.
Comcast.
Comcast continues to be our largest client, generating 22% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2019.
In November 2018, Comcast exercised the first of their two one-year renewal options extending the term of their agreement through June 30, 2020.
Terms of the extension remain consistent with the financial terms and obligations under the existing agreement.
Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Comcast has the right to exercise an additional one-year renewal option no later than January 1, 2020, to extend the term of the Agreement through June 30, 2021.
A copy of the Comcast agreement and related amendments, with confidential information redacted, is included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the SEC.
The preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to select appropriate accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies.
Cloud and Related Solutions Revenues.
Cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $219.6 million, a 24% increase when compared to $177.5 million for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in cloud and related solutions revenues between periods is primarily due to the additional revenues generated from the acquired Business Ink and Forte businesses, discussed above, and to a lesser degree, the execution of and performance under managed services and Ascendon arrangements.
Software and Services Revenues.
Software and services revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $13.0 million, a 9% increase when compared to $12.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the timing of work performed and execution of software license agreements.
Maintenance Revenues.
The components of total expenses are discussed in more detail below.
Cost of Revenues.
See our 2018 10-K for a description of the types of costs that are included in the individual line items for cost of revenues.
Cost of Cloud and Related Solutions (Exclusive of Depreciation).
The cost of cloud and related solutions for the first quarter of 2019 increased 32% to $114.7 million, from $86.9 million for the first quarter of 2018.
This increase can be mainly attributed to the cloud and related solutions expense of the acquired Business Ink and Forte businesses included in our results, to include acquisition amortization, and increased employee-related costs.
Total cloud and related solutions cost as a percentage of cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 52.2% and 49.0%, respectively (with the first quarter of 2019 reflective of the transaction fees of $17.1 million).
Cost of Software and Services (Exclusive of Depreciation).
The cost of software and services for the first quarter of 2019 was $8.8 million, a slight increase from $8.5 million for the first quarter of 2018.
Total software and services cost as a percentage of our software and services revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 67.9% and 71.4%, respectively.
Variability in quarterly revenues and operating results are inherent characteristics of companies that sell software licenses and perform professional services.
Cost of Maintenance (Exclusive of Depreciation).
The cost of maintenance for the first quarter of 2019 was $5.5 million, a slight decrease from $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2018.
Total cost of maintenance as a percentage of our maintenance revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 44.8% and 46.2%, respectively.
Depreciation expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased 31% to $5.1 million, from $3.9 million for the first quarter of 2018.
Operating Income.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was $32.1 million, or 13.1% of total revenues, compared to $25.8 million, or 12.8% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in operating income is a result of the higher revenues generated in the first quarter of 2019, as reflected by our relatively consistent operating margin percentage.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt.
As of March 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $141.9 million, as compared to $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
As part of our 2018 Credit Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in March 2023.
As of March 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2018 Revolver.
The 2018 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and financial covenants.
As of March 31, 2019, and the date of this filing, we believe that we are in compliance with the provisions of the 2018 Credit Agreement.
As of March 31, 2019, we had $3.0 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 reflect the negative impacts of the payment of the 2018 and 2017 year-end accrued employee incentive compensation in the first quarter subsequent to the year-end accrual for these items.
Additionally, cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by the timing around a certain recurring client payment at quarter-end.
This amount was subsequently collected in April 2019.
Management of our billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining consistently strong quarterly cash flows from operating activities.
As of March 31, 2019, approximately 95% of our billed accounts receivable balance is less than 60 days past due.
Accrued employee compensation decreased $9.6 million to $51.5 million as of March 31, 2019, from $61.1 million as of December 31, 2018, due primarily to the payment of the 2018 employee incentive compensation that was fully accrued at December 31, 2018, offset to a certain degree by the accrual for the 2019 employee incentive compensation.
Cash Dividends Paid on Common Stock.
During the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 0.2 million and 0.1 million shares of our common stock, respectively, under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $9.3 million and $5.7 million, respectively.
During the first quarter of 2019, we made principal repayments of $1.9 million.
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30.0 million.
As part of the refinancing, we paid $1.4 million of deferred financing costs.
As described in the Liquidity section above, we believe we have the ability to generate strong cash flows to fund our operating activities and act as a source of funds for our capital resource needs.
As of March 31, 2019, we had a $200 million revolving loan facility (2018 Revolver).
As of March 31, 2019, we had no borrowing outstanding on our 2018 Revolver and had the entire $200 million available to us.
As of March 31, 2019, we had 5.3 million shares authorized for repurchase remaining under our Stock Repurchase Program.
In September 2018, we announced an increase in our planned share repurchases of up to $150 million under our Stock Repurchase Program over the next three years.
Under our Stock Repurchase Program, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including through an accelerated stock repurchase plan or under a SEC Rule 10b5-1 plan.
Our common stock repurchases are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to our Financial Statements.
Going forward, we expect to pay cash dividends each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to the Board’s approval.
Acquisition.
On October 1, 2018, we acquired Forte, a leading provider of advanced payment solutions headquartered in Allen, Texas for a purchase price of approximately $93 million, (approximately $85 million, excluding cash acquired), and held back approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings.
The purchase agreement includes provisions for $18.8 million of potential future earn-out payments over a four-year measurement period.
Equity Method Investment.
In the first quarter of 2019, we made an additional $4 million investment in a payment technology and services company that enables omni-channel digital payments in Latin America.
As of March 31, 2019, we held an 8% noncontrolling interest with a carrying value of $6.7 million.
Capital Expenditures.
During the first quarter of 2019, we spent $8.3 million on capital expenditures.
As of March 31, 2019, we had committed to purchase approximately $6.5 million of equipment.
Stock Warrants.
In 2014, we issued Stock Warrants with an exercise price of $26.68 per warrant to Comcast as an incentive for Comcast to convert new customer accounts to ACP.
Once vested, Comcast may exercise the Stock Warrants and elect either physical delivery of common shares or net share settlement (cashless exercise).
As of March 31, 2019, approximately 1.4 million Stock Warrants are outstanding, of which 0.4 million are vested.
The Stock Warrants are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to our Financial Statements.
During the next twelve months, there are no scheduled conversion triggers on our 2016 Convertible Notes.
As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2016 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $9.8 million.
Our 2018 Credit Agreement mandatory repayments and the cash interest expense (based upon current interest rates) for the next twelve months is $7.5 million, and $6.3 million, respectively.
In summary, we expect to continue to have material needs for capital resources going forward, as noted above.
The following table presents information with respect to purchases of our common stock made during the first quarter of 2019 by CSG Systems International, Inc. or any “affiliated purchaser” of CSG Systems International, Inc., as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act.
