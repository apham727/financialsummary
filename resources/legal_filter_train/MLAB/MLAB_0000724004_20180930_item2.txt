Item 2.
Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
We are organized into four divisions across nine physical locations.
Our Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division (“SDC” Division) manufactures and sells biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators.
Biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes in the hospital, dental, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries.
Our Instruments Division designs, manufactures, and markets quality control instruments and disposable products utilized in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, medical device, industrial hygiene, and environmental air sampling industries.
Our Cold Chain Monitoring Division designs, develops, and markets systems which are used to monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and differential pressure to ensure that critical storage and processing conditions are maintained in hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, blood banks, pharmacies, and laboratory environments.
Our Cold Chain Packaging Division provides packaging development consulting services and thermal packaging products such as coolers, boxes, insulation materials, and phase-change products to control temperature during the customer’s transport of their own products.
Our revenues come from three main sources – hardware, consumables, and services.
Sterilization and disinfection control products and most products in our Cold Chain Packaging Division are disposable and are used on a routine basis, thus product sales are less sensitive to general economic conditions.
Service demand is driven by our customers’ quality control and regulatory environments, which require periodic repair and recalibration or certification of our instrument products and cold chain monitoring systems.
We typically evaluate costs and pricing annually.
Gross profit is affected by our product mix, manufacturing efficiencies, and price competition.
During the six months ended September 30, 2018, we continued to build our infrastructure to prepare for future growth, including completing the relocation and sale of the old Bozeman manufacturing facility, moving those operations into the new Bozeman building, the addition of key personnel to our operations, sales and marketing, and research and development teams, and the continued rollout of phase three of our ERP implementation project (European operations).
We are hopeful that we will have new products and services available for sale in the coming year.
Overall revenues increased eight percent, while organic revenues increased three percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, resulting from organic increases of nine percent and three percent from the Instruments and SDC Divisions, respectively, partially offset by organic decreases of six percent and 11 percent for the Cold Chain Monitoring and Cold Chain Packaging Divisions, respectively.
Overall revenues increased 10 percent, while organic revenues increased three percent, for the six months ended September 30, 2018, resulting from organic increases of 23 percent, five percent, and two percent from the Cold Chain Packaging, Instruments, and Cold Chain Monitoring Divisions, respectively, partially offset by an organic decrease of one percent for the SDC Division.
Instruments revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 increased nine percent and five percent, respectively, primarily due to the timing of orders and modest price increases.
However, the adoption rate of the product has increased over the past year.
Cold Chain Packaging revenues decreased 11 percent and increased 24 percent for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as a result of changes in the order rate of the division’s largest customer.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the customer’s order rate was higher than usual, resulting in organic growth for the six months ended September 30, 2018.
The higher-than-usual order rate was not sustained in the second quarter, resulting in organic growth declines for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
Excluding the impact of the moving expenses, gross margin percentage for both periods was essentially flat as compared to the prior year.
Instruments gross margin percentage increased during the six months ended September 30, 2018 due to favorable product and service mix, as well as a $163 increase in inventory reserve recorded in the six months ended September 30, 2017 as a result of the decision to discontinue the sale of certain instruments products.
Cold Chain Monitoring gross profit margin percentage increased during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to efficiency gains as well as a one-time incremental inventory reserve charge of $216 recorded in the six months ended September 30, 2017.
Cold Chain Packaging gross profit margin decreased during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 primarily as a result of increased sales volumes related to a large customer contract containing lower-than-standard contractual pricing.
Additionally, we experienced significantly higher costs on certain commodities during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 than in previous periods.
We are currently implementing a commercial initiative to pass some of these costs increases on to our customers.
Selling expense is driven primarily by labor costs, including salaries and commissions; accordingly, it may vary with sales levels.
Selling expense for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 decreased 21 percent and 26 percent, respectively, primarily due to timing of the reduction and replacement of selling personnel.
We plan to continue to strategically reinvest in sales and marketing resources in an effort to further increase organic revenues growth.
Labor costs, including non-cash stock-based compensation, and amortization of intangible assets drive the substantial majority of general and administrative expense.
General and administrative expenses increased $1,081 during the three months ended September 30, 2018, due primarily to $718 of increases in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets.
General and administrative costs increased $1,824 during the six months ended September 30, 2018, due primarily to $1,198 of increases in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets.
Research and development expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 decreased five percent and 18 percent, respectively, due to streamlining the necessary engineers, materials, and supplies required to support existing businesses.
We plan to make incremental investments in this area over time to further our development plans.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a $3,300 estimated legal settlement expense; see Note 9.
“Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 1.
Other expense for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 is composed primarily of interest expense associated with our Credit Facility, offset by a $288 gain recorded on the sale of our Bozeman facility; see Note 4.
Financial Statements for more information.
“Income Taxes” within Item 1.
Financial Statements for additional discussion.
The excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with share-based payment awards to our employees have caused and, in the future, may cause large fluctuations in our realized effective tax rate based on timing, volume, and nature of stock options exercised under our share-based payment program.
Net income for the six months ended September 30, 2018 varied with the changes in revenues, gross profit, and operating expenses (which includes $3,702 and $1,729 of non-cash amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation, respectively).
Our sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, working capital, capacity under our Credit Facility, and potential equity and debt offerings.
We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term needs.
Our more significant uses of resources have historically included long-term capital equipment expenditures, payment of debt obligations, quarterly dividends to shareholders, and acquisitions.
Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities.
We had working capital of $14,059 and $14,698 at September 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
Given our cash flow projections and unused capacity on our line of credit that is available until March 1, 2022, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements for our general business needs.
Interest-bearing debt of $33,375 and $46,625 was outstanding at September 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The remaining balance of principal and accrued interest are due on March 1, 2022.
We were in compliance with all loan agreements at September 30, 2018 and for all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations.
As of June 30, 2018, our previously-announced move of our Omaha, Traverse City, and old Bozeman manufacturing facilities to our new facility in Bozeman, Montana was complete.
We also completed the sale of our old Bozeman facility during the period ended September 30, 2018, which resulted in a gain of $288.
We have recorded an estimated litigation accrual of $3,300, which we expect to pay over the next twelve months; see Note 9.
“Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 1.
Future material acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital, assume third party debt or incur other long-term obligations.
At September 30, 2018, we had $64,500 on unused capacity under our credit facility, subject to covenant restrictions.
In addition, in June 2018, the SEC declared effective our Universal Shelf Registration Statement which allows us to sell, in one or more public offerings, common stock or warrants, or any combination of such securities for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to $300,000.
The terms of any offering, including the type of securities involved, would be established at the time of sale.
We have paid regular quarterly dividends since 2003.
We declared and paid dividends of $0.16 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as well as each quarter for the year ending March 31, 2018.
In October 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock, payable on December 17, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2018.
At September 30, 2018, we had contractual obligations for open purchase orders of approximately $3,325 for routine purchases of supplies and inventory, which are payable in less than one year.
Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters.
Item 2.
On November 7, 2005, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase plan which allows for the repurchase of up to 300,000 of our common shares, of which 162,486 have been purchased to date.
This plan will continue until the maximum is reached or the plan is terminated by further action of the Board of Directors.
We have made no repurchases of our common stock in the current or any of the last three fiscal years.
