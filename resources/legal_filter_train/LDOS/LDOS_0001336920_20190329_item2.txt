Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, we changed the composition of our Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers we serve.
In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments.
While this activity did not have a material impact on the Company's reportable segments, prior year segments results have been recast to reflect this change.
U.S. Government Markets
During the three months ended March 29, 2019, we generated approximately 87% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government.
Accordingly, our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending, especially on national security, homeland security and intelligence, and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the U.S. government.
In September 2018, Congress passed and the President signed a consolidated appropriations bill funding the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Health and Human Services for the full government fiscal year ("GFY") 2019.
All were funded at increased levels from the previous year.
From the expiration of that CR until the passage of a new CR on January 25, 2019 there was a partial U.S. government shutdown, which reduced or delayed work on existing contracts and caused delays in other government contracting actions and payments.
In March 2019, the President submitted the GFY 2020 budget proposal to Congress.
The budget includes $750 billion for defense and $563 billion for non-defense spending.
The defense budget proposal includes $576 billion for national defense and $165 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.
Congress has begun the process of considering this proposal.
Sales to customers in international markets represented approximately 8% of total revenues for the three months ended March 29, 2019.
The increase in revenues in constant currency(1) for the three months ended March 29, 2019, was 6.1%, as compared to an actual increase in revenues of 5.5%.
The foreign currency impact was mainly attributable to adverse exchange rate movements in the British pound and Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar.
The increase in revenues for the three months ended March 29, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 30, 2018, was primarily attributable to new awards and a net increase in program volumes, partially offset by the completion of certain contracts, the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates movement between the U.S. dollar and the Australian dollar and higher net profit write-ups in the prior year quarter.
 The decrease in operating income for the three months ended March 29, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 30, 2018, was primarily due to higher net profit write-ups in the prior year quarter, partially offset by new awards.

The increase in operating income for the three months ended March 29, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 30, 2018, was primarily due to new awards and lower amortization of intangibles, partially offset by higher net profit write-ups in the prior year quarter and the timing of material deliveries on certain contracts.
The increase in revenues and operating income for the three months ended March 29, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 30, 2018, was primarily attributable to a net increase in program volumes and new awards, partially offset by the completion of certain contracts.
The decrease in operating loss for the three months ended March 29, 2019, as compared to the three months ended March 30, 2018, was primarily attributable to lower integration and restructuring costs and an asset impairment charge in the prior year quarter.
Non-operating income, net for the three months ended March 29, 2019 was $54 million as compared to non-operating expense, net of $34 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018.

For the three months ended March 29, 2019, our effective tax rate was 23.2% compared to 18.4% for the three months ended March 30, 2018.
The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduced benefit from employee stock-based awards and an increase in certain unrecognized tax benefits.
We recorded net bookings worth an estimated $3.3 billion during the three months ended March 29, 2019, as compared to $2.5 billion for the three months ended March 30, 2018.
Total backlog at March 29, 2019 included a favorable impact of $61 million when compared to total backlog at December 28, 2018, due to exchange rate movements in the British pound and Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar.
Our total backlog consists of remaining performance obligations (see "Note 5–Revenues") and unexercised option periods.
As of March 29, 2019, we had $536 million in cash and cash equivalents.

This activity included $27 million and $15 million of required quarterly principal payments on our senior secured term loans during the three months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, respectively.
In April 2018, we made a required debt prepayment of $10 million on our senior secured term loans.
The prepayment was a result of the annual excess cash flow calculation clause in our credit agreements.
We were in compliance with all covenants as of March 29, 2019.
We paid dividends of $54 million and $52 million during the three months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, respectively.
For the next 12 months, we anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs, including servicing our debt, through cash generated from operations, available cash balances and, if needed, borrowings from our revolving credit facility.
We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds as described in "Note 19–Commitments" of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
