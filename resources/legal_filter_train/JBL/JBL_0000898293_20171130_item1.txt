The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S.
GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Jabil Inc. (the Company) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017.
The Company calculates its basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to Jabil Inc. by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
The Companys diluted earnings per share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the effect of dilutive securities.
The difference between the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding and the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to dilutive unvested restricted stock awards and dilutive stock appreciation rights.
 (1) Represents a one-time cash-settled stock award that vested on November 30, 2017.
As of November 30, 2017, the shares available to be issued under the 2011 Stock Award and Incentive Plan were 12,327,622.
On October 6, 2017, the Companys Compensation Committee approved the modification of vesting criteria for certain performance-based restricted stock awards granted in fiscal year 2015.
As a result of the modification, 0.8 million awards vested during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which resulted in approximately $24.9 million of stock-based compensation expense recognized for the three months ended November 30, 2017.
In July 2017, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $450.0 million of the Companys common stock (the 2017 Share Repurchase Program).
The 2017 Share Repurchase Program expires on August 31, 2018.
As of November 30, 2017, 3.2 million shares had been repurchased for $93.2 million and $356.7 million remains available under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program.
During the three months ended November 30, 2017, the Companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of its net revenue and 74 customers accounted for approximately 90% of its net revenue.
Sales to these customers were reported in the Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS) operating segments.
The Company procures components from a broad group of suppliers.
Almost all of the products manufactured by the Company require one or more components that are available from only a single source.
Net revenue for the operating segments is attributed to the segment in which the service is performed.
An operating segments performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income.
Total segment assets are defined as accounts receivable, inventories, net customer-related property, plant and equipment, intangible assets net of accumulated amortization and goodwill.
All other non-segment assets are reviewed on a global basis by management.
Transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which we would transact with third parties.
As of November 30, 2017, the Company operated in 29 countries worldwide.
Sales to unaffiliated customers are based on the Companys location that maintains the customer relationship and transacts the external sale.
Total foreign net revenue represented 92.3% of net revenue during both the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016.
 (1)  The notes are carried at the principal amount of each note, less any unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs.
 (2)  The Senior Notes are the Companys senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.
Additionally, the Companys foreign subsidiaries had various additional credit facilities that finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs.
As of November 30, 2017, the Company has $2.2 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities.
The estimated fair values of the Companys publicly traded debt, including the 8.250%, 5.625% and 4.700% senior notes, were approximately $405.6 million, $431.2 million and $525.3 million, respectively, as of November 30, 2017.
The fair value estimates are based upon observable market data (Level 2 criteria).
The estimated fair value of the Companys private debt, the 4.900% senior notes, was approximately $311.7 million, as of November 30, 2017.
The carrying amounts of borrowings under credit facilities and under loans approximate fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates.
The Company regularly sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset-backed securitization programs and five uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs).
The Company continues servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under each of the programs.
Servicing fees related to each of the programs recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016 were not material.
The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities.
The special purpose entity in the North American asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
The special purpose entity in the foreign asset-backed securitization program is a separate bankruptcy-remote entity whose assets would be first available to satisfy the creditor claims of the unaffiliated financial institution.
The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of this special purpose entity as the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity from the transfer of the trade accounts receivable into the special purpose entity.
Accordingly, the special purpose entities associated with these asset-backed securitization programs are included in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
 (2) On November 9, 2017, the program was extended to October 20, 2020.
 (1) For the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, the amount represented proceeds from collections reinvested in revolving-period transfers as there were no new transfers during the period.
 (2) Recorded to other expense within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 (3) Recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), primarily discounted cash flows, and due to their credit quality and short-term maturity the fair values approximated book values.
The unobservable inputs consist of estimated credit losses and estimated discount rates, which both have an immaterial impact on the fair value calculations.
The asset-backed securitization programs require compliance with several covenants.
As of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the asset-backed securitization programs.
 (2) The maximum amount under the program will be reduced to $650.0 million on February 1, 2018.
 (1) There is no tax benefit (expense) related to the foreign currency translation adjustment components of AOCI, including reclassification adjustments, for the three months ended November 30, 2017.
 (2) $3.5 million of AOCI reclassified into earnings during the three months ended November 30, 2017 for derivative instruments was classified as a reduction of income tax expense.
The remaining amount reclassified into earnings was primarily classified as a component of cost of revenue.
$11.3 million expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months will be classified as a reduction of income tax expense.
The remaining amount expected to be reclassified into earnings will be classified as a component of cost of revenue.
The annual tax benefit (expense) for unrealized gains on derivative instruments is not material for the three months ended November 30, 2017.
 (3) There is no tax benefit (expense) related to the available for sale securities components of AOCI, including reclassification adjustments, for the three months ended November 30, 2017.
The Company is party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business.
At this time, anticipating the amount of any future IRS proposed adjustments, interest and penalties is not practicable.
The Company disagrees with the proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously contest these matters through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate.
As the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain, the Company continues to provide for the uncertain tax positions based on the more likely than not standard.
However, there can be no assurance that managements beliefs will be realized.
The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
A hedging relationship existed with an aggregate notional amount outstanding of $480.7 million and $314.6 million as of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, respectively.
The related forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
In addition to derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also enters into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, fixed purchase obligations and intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity.
The aggregate notional amount of these outstanding contracts as of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, was $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.
The Companys forward foreign exchange contracts are measured on a recurring basis at fair value, based on foreign currency spot rates and forward rates quoted by banks or foreign currency dealers.
The Company periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with the Companys borrowings.
The forward starting swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and have been designated as hedging instruments and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The forward starting swaps are scheduled to expire on March 15, 2018.
If the anticipated debt issuance occurs before March 15, 2018, the contracts will be terminated simultaneously with the debt issuance.
Changes in the fair value of the forward starting swap transactions are recorded on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of AOCI.
The interest rate swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and have been designated as hedging instruments and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The interest rate swaps were effective on September 30, 2016 and are scheduled to expire on June 30, 2019.
The contracts will be settled with the respective counterparties on a net basis at each settlement date.
Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap transactions are recorded on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of AOCI.
 (1) Includes $5.9 million and $7.4 million recorded in the EMS segment, $4.6 million and $11.5 million recorded in the DMS segment and $0.9 million and $17.0 million of non-allocated charges for the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 (2)  Primarily relates to the 2017 Restructuring Plan.
Upon completion of the 2017 Restructuring Plan, the Company expects to recognize approximately $195.0 million in restructuring and other related costs.
The Company has incurred $164.6 million in costs-to-date as of November 30, 2017.
On September 1, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of True-Tech Corporation (True-Tech) for approximately $95.9 million in cash, which remains subject to adjustment based on review of the actual net assets of the acquisition as of the closing date.
True-Tech is a manufacturer specializing in aerospace, semiconductor and medical machined components.
The acquisition of True-Tech assets has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.
Assets acquired of $114.4 million, including $25.9 million in intangible assets and $22.3 million in goodwill, and liabilities assumed of $18.5 million were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.
The Company is currently evaluating the fair values of the assets related to this business combination.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities was recorded to goodwill and was fully allocated to the EMS segment.
Pro forma information has not been provided as the acquisition of True-Tech is not deemed to be significant.
During fiscal year 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard which will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP.
The new standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this standard.
The Company has determined that the new standard will result in a change to the timing of the Companys revenue recognition policy for certain customer contracts to an over time model as opposed to a point in time model upon delivery.
Under the new standard, such up-front costs would be recognized as an asset and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of the goods to which the asset relates.
The financial impacts of the new standard cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.
Early application is permitted only for certain provisions, and the update must be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the standard.
The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard revising lease accounting.
The new guidance requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and disclose key information regarding leasing arrangements.
Early application of the new standard is permitted and the standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
The adoption of this standard will impact the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company is currently assessing any other impacts this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard, which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
This guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective or prospective transition method, depending on the area covered by this accounting standard.
The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to address the presentation of certain transactions within the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The new standard eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is permitted.
This guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and will be applied on a prospective basis.
Early application is permitted for certain transactions.
During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge.
Goodwill will be considered impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value.
The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis.
The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the scope of accounting for asset derecognition and adds further guidance for recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of non-financial assets in contracts with non-customers.
The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recently issued accounting guidance not discussed above is not applicable or did not have, or is not expected to have, a material impact to the Company.
