The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X.
The January 28, 2018 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise noted, considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included.
The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period.
The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.
Except for the accounting policy for revenue recognition, which was updated as a result of adopting a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.
Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.
For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.
Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.
As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed.
We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.
Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.
Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS.
For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation.
Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer.
PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January.
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries.
Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
In February 2016 and July 2018, the FASB issued accounting standards updates regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for lease terms of more than 12 months.
The FASB also recently provided a practical expedient transition method to adopt the new lease accounting requirements.
We are evaluating the impact of adopting the new lease accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements, systems and processes in conjunction with our review of lease agreements.
The updates will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
We expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
On January 29, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective method and applied it to contracts that were not completed as of that date.
Upon adoption, we recognized the cumulative effect of the new standard as a $7 million increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax.
The impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 was not significant.
Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the amount of contracted license and development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized.
Refer to Note 15 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including disaggregated revenue disclosures.
Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $73 million and $89 million, respectively.
Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $105 million and $144 million, respectively.
The Convertible Notes had a dilutive impact on net income per share as our average stock price for the reporting period exceeded the adjusted conversion price of $20.02 per share.
The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, outstanding were also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share.
As of October 28, 2018, there were no warrants outstanding.
Refer to Note 12 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Convertible Notes.
We recognized an income tax benefit of $149 million and $3 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and income tax expense of $58 million and $189 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, respectively.
Income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.8% and nominal for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and income tax expense as a percentage of income before tax was 6.5% and 8.9% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, respectively.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of U.S. tax reform, and a $138 million reduction in our provisional U.S. tax reform transition tax amount in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
The TCJA was effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and we have recorded provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects.
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we reduced our provisional transition tax amount based on proposed regulations issued on August 1, 2018.
Given the complexity of the GILTI provisions, we are still evaluating its effects and have not yet determined our accounting policy.
We expect to complete our analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
As of October 28, 2018, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” debt securities.
The gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, temporary in nature, and driven primarily by changes in interest rates.
We have the intent and ability to hold our investments until maturity.
For the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, there were no other-than-temporary impairment losses and net realized gains were not significant.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of October 28, 2018 and January 28, 2018 are shown below by contractual maturity.
The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets.
We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis.
There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 financial assets and liabilities for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The increase in gross carrying amount of intangible assets is due to purchases of licensed technology during the first nine months of fiscal year 2019.
Amortization expense associated with intangible assets was $7 million and $24 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and $13 million and $42 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, respectively.
Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets as of October 28, 2018 is estimated to be $6 million for the remainder of fiscal year 2019, $21 million in fiscal year 2020, $12 million in fiscal year 2021, $5 million in fiscal year 2022, $4 million in fiscal year 2023, and $1 million in fiscal year 2024.
As of October 28, 2018, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $1.56 billion.
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses.
We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis.
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar.
As of October 28, 2018, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months.
During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.
Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.
U.S. GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee.
We record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates.
Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products.
The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities was $18 million and $15 million as of October 28, 2018 and January 28, 2018, respectively.
Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability.
In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the Notes.
Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium.
However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026.
The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.
The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.
In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018.
The Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 and we had $3 million in principal amount outstanding as of October 28, 2018.
Effective August 1, 2018, holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes before the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2018 regardless of conversion conditions.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we paid cash to settle an aggregate of $11 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes and issued 485 thousand shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value.
The related loss on early conversions was not significant.
Based on the closing price of our common stock of $198.29 on the last trading day of the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, the if-converted value of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $31 million.
As of October 28, 2018, the conversion rate was 49.95 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes.
We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million.
We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.
As of October 28, 2018, we had not issued any commercial paper.

Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.
We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying architecture.
While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for artificial intelligence, or AI, data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users.
Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.
Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business.
In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis.
Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported.
The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements.
The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.
No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018.
Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing more than 10% of total accounts receivable, aggregated approximately 14% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of October 28, 2018, and approximately 28% of our accounts receivable balance from two customers as of January 28, 2018.
Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal proceedings since January 28, 2018.
