Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. 
In November 2018, the Board authorized an additional $7.00 billion under our share repurchase program and extended it through the end of December 2022. As of November 5, 2018, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.94 billion through December 2022.
For fiscal year 2019, we previously announced our plan to return $1.25 billion to shareholders. We now intend to return an additional $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, which may begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we issued 485 thousand shares of our common stock upon settlement of $11 million in principal of Convertible Notes submitted for conversion. In connection with these conversions, we exercised a portion of our Note Hedges to acquire an equal number of shares of our common stock. The counterparty to the Note Hedges may be deemed an “affiliated purchaser” and may have purchased the shares of our common stock deliverable to us upon this exercise of our option. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Convertible Notes and the Note Hedges.
We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we withheld approximately 1.7 million shares at a total cost of $467 million through net share settlements. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we withheld approximately 3.8 million shares at a total cost of $982 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.
