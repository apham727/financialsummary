Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks, we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures, and there can be no assurance that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
Borrowings under our Term Loan A-1 and our Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, of either an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (subject to a 0.0% floor) plus an applicable margin varying from 1.125% to 2.000% or a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0.125% to 1.000%, in each case depending on our corporate credit ratings. Currently we have selected the LIBOR rate option, and the applicable interest rate was 3.38% as of March 30, 2018.
Borrowings under the U.S. Term Loan B-3 tranche bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, of either an adjusted LIBOR rate, subject to a 0.00% floor, plus 2.00% or a base rate plus 1.00%. Currently we have selected the LIBOR rate option, and the applicable interest rate was 3.88% as of March 30, 2018.
We have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. At March 30, 2018, 70% of the par value of our debt was at variable rates. To balance the portfolio, we entered into a pay-fixed interest rate swap on $1.00 billion notional amount, which effectively converts a portion of our term loan to fixed rates through May 2020. As of March 30, 2018, we had $7.98 billion of variable rate debt. After giving effect to the $1.00 billion of interest rate swaps, we effectively had $6.98 billion of long-term debt subject to variations in interest rates and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest, subject to each loan’s specific floor, would increase annual interest expense by $70 million.
For additional information regarding our term loans and our interest rate swaps, see Part I, Item 1, Note 6, Debt, of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.
