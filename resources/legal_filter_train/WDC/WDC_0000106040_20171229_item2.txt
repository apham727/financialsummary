The Refinancing Transactions are expected to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.
In connection with the Refinancing Transactions, we have announced that we intend to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock in privately negotiated or open market transactions.

In September 2017, Toshiba Corporation (“Toshiba”), of which TMC is a wholly owned subsidiary, announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell TMC, including its interest in Flash Ventures, to a consortium led by SK Hynix Inc. and Bain Capital Private Equity, L.P., BCPE Pangea Cayman, L.P., BCPE Pangea Cayman2, Ltd., Bain Capital Fund XII, L.P., Bain Capital Asia Fund III, L.P. and Pangea (together, “Bain Capital”), that includes other competitors, as well as key customers.
We previously asserted our consent rights under the terms of the Flash Ventures agreements with respect to the transactions involving, among other things, the transfer by Toshiba of its interests in Flash Ventures to TMC, and the proposed sale of TMC to a consortium of investors led by Bain Capital.
In December 2017, we entered into a Confidential Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the “Toshiba Settlement Agreement”) with Toshiba and TMC pursuant to which the parties agreed to withdraw and seek dismissal of the litigation and arbitration proceedings related to the transfer of Toshiba’s interests in Flash Ventures and related matters.
In addition to the settlement with Toshiba and TMC, we also entered into a settlement agreement with Bain Capital and certain other agreements with TMC related to the operation of Flash Ventures.
See Part I, Item 1, Note 13, Legal Proceedings, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion of the litigation and arbitration proceedings between the parties and the Toshiba Settlement Agreement.
See Part I, Item 1, Note 8, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Parties, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q for additional information on Flash Ventures.
In connection with the Toshiba Settlement Agreement, in December 2017, we entered into a facility agreement (the “Y6 Facility Agreement”) with TMC regarding the construction and operation of a new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Yokkaichi, Japan, referred to as “Fab 6”.
The primary purpose of Fab 6, which is located adjacent to the fabrication facilities in Yokkaichi currently utilized by Flash Ventures, is to provide cleanroom space to continue the transition of the parties’ existing 2D NAND manufacturing capacity to BiCS 3D NAND manufacturing capacity.
The Y6 Facility Agreement establishes terms for the manufacture of NAND in Fab 6 and amends the existing agreements governing Flash Ventures to provide for their use of Fab 6.
The Company’s share of the initial commitment is expected to be approximately $950 million, mostly for equipment investments and some start-up costs to be incurred primarily through calendar 2018.
In connection with the Toshiba Settlement Agreement, in December 2017, we also entered into agreements with TMC to extend the term of Flash Alliance Ltd. to December 31, 2029 and the term of Flash Forward Ltd. to December 31, 2027.
•We made a voluntary prepayment of the full principal amounts of our Euro-denominated term B-2 loans (“Euro Term Loan B-2”) using cash on hand.
For additional information regarding our debt facilities, see Part I, Item 1, Note 6, Debt, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q.
The increase in net revenue for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily reflects a favorable flash memory demand environment and growth of our diversified product portfolio.
For the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, Client Devices revenue increased 9.5% and 11.1%, respectively, year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in mobility, client solid state drives (“SSD”) and surveillance products.
Our revenue for Data Center Devices and Solutions for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 increased 2.9% and 1.6%, respectively, year-over-year, driven primarily by a significant increase in sales from our capacity enterprise hard disk drives (“HDD”), partially offset by an expected decline in sales from our performance enterprise HDDs.
Client Solutions revenue for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 increased 16.6% and 16.5%, respectively, year-over-year, primarily as a result of the strength and reach of our valuable global retail brands.
Our top 10 customers accounted for 42% and 41% of our net revenue for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, respectively, and 43% and 42% of our net revenue for the three and six months ended December 30, 2016, respectively.
For the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue.
For the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, these programs represented 12% and 13% of gross revenues, respectively.
The increase in gross profit for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 reflects the increase in revenue discussed above and improvements in our gross margin.
The increase in gross margin for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 was primarily due to a favorable demand environment for flash-based products, improvements in our production costs from technology transitions and a higher mix of flash-based product revenue.
Gross profit was negatively impacted by amortization expense on acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation, charges related to the implementation of cost-saving initiatives and other charges, which aggregated $293 million, or 5.5%, of revenue, for the three months ended December 29, 2017, and $259 million, or 5.3%, of revenue, for the three months ended December 30, 2016.
Gross profit was negatively impacted by amortization expense on acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation, charges related to the implementation of cost-saving initiatives and other charges, which aggregated $572 million, or 5.4%, of revenue, for the six months ended December 29, 2017, and $523 million, or 5.4%, of revenue, for the six months ended December 30, 2016.
Employee termination and other charges for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 primarily related to further actions associated with the integration and business realignment of substantial portions of our business.
For additional information regarding employee termination, asset impairment and other charges, see Part I, Item 1, Note 12, Employee Termination, Asset Impairment and Other Charges, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q.
Total interest and other income (expense), net for the three months ended December 29, 2017 decreased $43 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher foreign exchange losses and other charges of $26 million in the prior year, lower interest expense of $8 million resulting from reductions in the principal amount of debt and higher interest income of $9 million related to increased investments.
Total interest and other income (expense), net for the six months ended December 29, 2017 decreased $351 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt of $292 million recognized in the prior year, lower interest expense of $39 million resulting from reductions in the principal amount of debt and higher interest income of $20 million related to increased investments.
Under the 2017 Act, the U.S. federal corporate tax rate is reduced from 35% to 21% and is effective January 1, 2018 resulting in the use of an estimated annual effective rate of approximately 28% for our U.S. federal corporate tax rate for fiscal year 2018.
The reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to the blended tax rate of 28% for fiscal year 2018 is estimated to have reduced our income tax expense by $7 million for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017.
Both items are included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The primary drivers for the remaining difference between the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 28% are the current year generation of tax credits, and tax holidays in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand that expire at various dates during fiscal years 2018 through 2030 and windfall tax benefits related to vesting and exercises of stock-based awards.
The windfall tax benefits are a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires us to now recognize $5 million and $27 million of windfall tax benefits related to vesting and exercises of stock-based awards as a component of our income tax expense for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, respectively.
The windfall tax benefits for the three and six months ended December 30, 2016 were recorded within stockholders’ equity.
Income tax expense for the six months ended December 30, 2016 was attributable to discrete effects consisting of income tax expense from the integration of SanDisk Corporation (“SanDisk”) of $90 million and a valuation allowance on acquired tax attributes of $109 million, partially offset by income tax benefit from deductible debt issuance costs, debt discounts and prepayment fees from the debt extinguishment of $96 million.
The primary drivers for the difference between the effective tax rate for the six months ended December 30, 2016 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% are these discrete items, the current year generation of tax credits and tax holidays in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand that expire at various dates during fiscal years 2018 through 2030.
We believe our cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt, stock repurchases, dividend and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months.
During 2018, we expect cash used for purchases of property, plant and equipment and net activity in notes receivable and equity investments relating to Flash Ventures to be approximately $1.50 billion to $1.90 billion.
The total expected cash to be used could vary depending on the timing and completion of various capital projects and the availability, timing and terms of related financing.
As described above, we also expect that if the Refinancing Transactions and share repurchase are completed, our total debt outstanding will decrease by approximately $1.00 billion and our available cash on hand will decrease by approximately $2.40 billion compared to December 29, 2017.
For the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, we recorded a provisional amount for the mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability of $1.66 billion, which is payable over an 8-year period as further discussed below under “Short and Long-term Liquidity-Contractual Obligations and Commitments.” The provisional amount included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Operations may change when we finalize the calculation of our post-1986 foreign earnings and profits that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes and the amount of foreign earnings held in cash or other specified assets.
A total of $4.90 billion and $4.99 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the U.S. as of December 29, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively.
This requires us to re-evaluate the existing short and long-term capital allocation policies in light of the 2017 Act and calculate the tax cost, that is incremental to the U.S. deemed repatriation tax, (e.g.
Cash flow from operating activities primarily consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash charges, plus or minus changes in other operating assets and liabilities.
This represents our principal source of cash.
Net cash provided by changes in other operating assets and liabilities was $1.27 billion for the six months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to net cash used for changes in other operating assets and liabilities of $37 million for the six months ended December 30, 2016.
Changes in days sales outstanding (“DSOs”) are generally due to the linearity of shipments.
Changes in days in inventory (“DIOs”) are generally related to the timing of inventory builds.
From time to time, we modify the timing of payments to our vendors.
We make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our cash balances.
Generally, we make the payment term modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to, or receiving from, our vendors’ payment term accommodations.
For the six months ended December 29, 2017, DSO decreased by 3 days over the prior year, primarily reflecting routine variations in the timing of customer receipts.
DPO primarily reflects routine variations in timing of purchases and payments and remained consistent over the prior year.
Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 29, 2017 primarily consisted of $416 million of capital expenditures, a net $509 million increase in notes receivable issuances to Flash Ventures, and $99 million for acquisitions.
Our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government agency securities as well as bank certificates of deposit.
In addition, we invest directly in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. and International Government agency securities, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and corporate and municipal notes and bonds.
Other than the commitments related to Flash Ventures, facility lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions (see “Contractual Obligations and Commitments” below), we do not have any other material off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any other obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity.
We do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any special-purpose entities.
For additional information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Part I, Item 1, Note 8, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Parties, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q.
See Part I, Item 1, Note 6, Debt, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q for information regarding our indebtedness, including information about new borrowings and repayments, increased availability under our revolving credit facility and the principal repayment terms, interest rates, covenants and other key terms of our outstanding indebtedness.
We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to moderate our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates underlying our variable rate debt.
For a description of our current interest rate swaps, see Part I, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Part I, Item 1, Note 5, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q.
Flash Ventures sells and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions a portion of its tools and has entered into equipment lease agreements of which we guarantee half of the total outstanding obligations.
In addition to containing customary events of default related to Flash Ventures that could result in an acceleration of Flash Ventures’ obligations, the lease agreements contain acceleration clauses for certain events of default related to the guarantors, including us.
See Part I, Item 1, Note 8, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Parties, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q for information regarding Flash Ventures.
For a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments, see Part I, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Part I, Item 1, Note 5, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q.
In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.
We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.
Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements.
The 2017 Act allows for the provisional mandatory deemed repatriation tax of $1.66 billion to be payable over an 8-year period without interest.
As of December 29, 2017, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties) was approximately $529 million.
Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 29, 2017 was approximately $94 million.
Of these amounts, approximately $502 million could result in potential cash payments.
Since the first quarter of 2013, we have issued a quarterly cash dividend.
On November 1, 2017, we declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share of our common stock to our shareholders of record as of December 29, 2017.
On January 27, 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share of our common stock to our shareholders of record as of March 30, 2018, which will be paid on April 16, 2018.
We may modify, suspend, or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASC Topic 606”), which amends the guidance in former ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition”, to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers.
ASC Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Based on our preliminary plan, we intend to adopt the new standard beginning with the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method; however, we continue to assess this in connection with our entire project plan.
•Substantially all of our current revenue is from the sale of hardware products.
We do not expect any material changes to the timing or amount of revenue for these types of sales under the new standard.
•For sales-based royalties, we will need to estimate and recognize revenue in the period the royalty-bearing sales occur as opposed to the existing treatment of recognizing revenue in the period the royalty report is received.
This change will result in the acceleration of revenue recognition by one fiscal quarter as well as fluctuations between the estimated and actual reported sales-based royalties which we do not expect to be material.
•For software and IP licenses, we are still assessing the impact and timing to revenue from the implementation of the new standard.
However, we do not currently expect the new standard to have a material impact on our revenue for these types of arrangements.
As we are completing our assessment, we are also identifying and preparing to implement changes to our processes, internal controls and systems configurations from the implementation of the new revenue standard.
We do not currently expect any significant changes to our other accounting policies from the adoption of the new revenue standard.
Our implementation efforts are progressing as planned.
We have prepared the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
We have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate.
