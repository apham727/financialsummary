Our fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to June 30 and typically consists of 52 weeks.
Fiscal year 2020, which ends on July 3, 2020, will be comprised of 53 weeks, with the first quarter consisting of 14 weeks and the remaining quarters consisting of 13 weeks each.
Fiscal year 2019, which ended on June 28, 2019, was comprised of 52 weeks, with all quarters presented consisting of 13 weeks.
Through our three business ventures with Kioxia Corporation (formerly known as Toshiba Memory Corporation) (“Kioxia”), referred to as “Flash Ventures”, we and Kioxia operate flash-based memory wafer manufacturing facilities in Japan.
We are obligated to pay for variable costs incurred in producing our share of Flash Ventures’ flash-based memory wafer supply, based on our three month forecast, which generally equals 50% of Flash Ventures’ output.
In addition, we are obligated to pay for half of Flash Ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output we choose to purchase.
We are also obligated to fund 49.9% to 50% of Flash Ventures’ capital investments to the extent that Flash Ventures’ operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments.
Since its inception, Flash Ventures has been based in a manufacturing site in Yokkaichi, Japan, which currently includes five wafer fabrication facilities.
Production levels at the Yokkaichi site were temporarily reduced as a result of an unexpected power outage incident that occurred in the Yokkaichi region on June 15, 2019.
The power outage incident impacted the facilities and process tools and resulted in the damage of flash wafers in production.
The incident resulted in a reduction of our flash wafer availability by approximately 4 exabytes, the majority of which was contained in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
We are pursuing recovery of our losses associated with this event; however, the amount of any recovery cannot be estimated at this time.
In May 2019, we entered into additional agreements with Kioxia to extend Flash Ventures to a new wafer fabrication facility, known as “K1,” located in Kitakami, Japan.
The primary purpose of K1 is to provide clean room space to continue the transition of existing flash-based wafer capacity to newer technology nodes.
We also agreed to prepay an aggregate of approximately $360 million over a 3-year period beginning in the first half of fiscal year 2020 toward K1 building depreciation, to be credited against future wafer charges.
In September 2019, we announced the sale of our IntelliFlash business and our strategic intention to exit Storage Systems, which consists of IntelliFlash and ActiveScale.
These actions will allow us to redirect investments to other higher value priorities.
This decline was partially offset by growth in HDD volumes, which contributed approximately 11 percentage points of growth while higher volumes of flash products contributed approximately three percentage points of growth.
Our revenue for Data Center Devices and Solutions increased 6% year over year, resulting from an approximately 50-percentage point increase in volume, predominantly from capacity enterprise HDD, partially offset by lower average selling prices.
Client Solutions revenue decreased 4% year over year, which predominantly reflects lower prices on retail products.
We anticipate flash pricing to improve during fiscal 2020, if supply and demand become more closely aligned as expected.
One customer accounted for 11% of our net revenue for the three months ended October 4, 2019, and two customers accounted for 11% and 10%, respectively, of our net revenue for the three months ended September 28, 2018.
For the three month ended October 4, 2019 and September 28, 2018, our top 10 customers accounted for 43% and 48% of our net revenue, respectively.
Substantially all of the decrease in gross profit in the three months ended October 4, 2019 from the comparable period in the prior year was due to the lower revenues noted above.
In addition, amortization expense on acquired intangible assets decreased by $71 million, partially offset by $68 million of additional charges related to the power outage incident.
Gross margin declined 14 percentage points year over year, substantially all of which is attributable to the lower average selling prices for flash-based products noted above.
For additional information regarding employee termination, asset impairment and other charges, see Part I, Item 1, Note 14, Employee Termination, Asset Impairment and Other Charges, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The increase in total interest and other expense, net primarily reflects a $6 million increase in interest expense resulting from the additional week in the current year quarter.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”) includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses.
The primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for the three months ended October 4, 2019 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction, the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, credits and tax holidays in Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand that will expire at various dates during fiscal years 2020 through 2030.
The primary driver of the difference between the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2018 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% is the discrete effect of the provisional income tax benefit of $52 million related to the decision to utilize our 2018 operating loss to partially offset the mandatory deemed repatriation tax.
We believe our cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt, dividend and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months.
During fiscal 2020, we expect cash used for purchases of property, plant and equipment and net activity in notes receivable and equity investments relating to our Flash Ventures joint venture with Kioxia to be less than $500 million.
A total of $2.60 billion and $2.37 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the U.S. as of October 4, 2019 and June 28, 2019, respectively.
After consideration of this interpretative guidance, we made the determination that we do not intend to repatriate this portion of our foreign undistributed earnings and did not establish an accrual for this liability.
Changes in days sales outstanding (“DSOs”) are generally due to the linearity of shipments.
Changes in days in inventory (“DIOs”) are generally related to the timing of inventory builds.
From time to time, we modify the timing of payments to our vendors.
We make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our cash balances.
Generally, we make the payment term modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to, or receiving from, our vendors’ payment term accommodations.
For the three months ended October 4, 2019, DSO decreased by 5 days over the prior year, primarily reflecting the timing of shipments and customer collections.
DPO increased by 3 days over the prior year, primarily reflecting resumptions of normal flash production volumes as well as routine variations in timing of purchases and payments during the period.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended October 4, 2019 primarily consisted of a $186 million net decrease in notes receivable issuances to Flash Ventures, partially offset by $145 million of capital expenditures and $22 million for acquisitions.
Our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government agency securities.
In addition, from time to time, we invest directly in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. and international government agency securities, certificates of deposit, asset backed securities and corporate and municipal notes and bonds.
Other than the commitments related to Flash Ventures, facility lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions (see “Short and Long-term Liquidity-Contractual Obligations and Commitments” below), we do not have any other material off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any other obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity.
We do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, with the exception of Flash Ventures and our joint venture with Unisplendour Corporation Limited and Unissoft (Wuxi) Group Co. Ltd. (“Unis”), referred to as the “Unis Venture”, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any variable interest entities.
For additional information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Part I, Item 1, Note 9, Related Parties and Related Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Additional information regarding our indebtedness, including information about availability under our revolving credit facility and the principal repayment terms, interest rates, covenants and other key terms of our outstanding indebtedness, is included in Part I, Item 1, Note 7, Debt, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2019.
The credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A-1 requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.
Flash Ventures sells to and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions a portion of its tools and has entered into equipment lease agreements of which we guarantee half or all of the outstanding obligations under each lease agreement.
The leases are subject to customary covenants and cancellation events that relate to Flash Ventures and each of the guarantors.
The occurrence of a cancellation event could result in an acceleration of the lease obligations and a call on our guarantees.
See Part I, Item 1, Note 9, Related Parties and Related Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding Flash Ventures.
We also enter into long-term agreements with suppliers that contain fixed future commitments, which are contingent on certain conditions such as performance, quality and technology of the vendor’s components.
As of October 4, 2019, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties) was approximately $691 million.
Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of October 4, 2019 was approximately $126 million.
Of these amounts, approximately $698 million could result in potential cash payments.
We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to moderate our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates underlying our variable rate debt.
For a description of our current interest rate swaps, see Part I, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.
We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.
Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements.
Our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $5.00 billion of our common stock, which authorization is effective through July 25, 2023.
For the three months ended October 4, 2019, we did not make any stock repurchases.
Repurchases under the stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan.
We expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows.
Since the first quarter of 2013, we have issued a quarterly cash dividend.
During the three months ended October 4, 2019, we declared aggregate cash dividends of $0.50 per share on our outstanding common stock totaling $149 million, which was paid on October 22, 2019.
We may modify, suspend, or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time.
We have prepared the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).
We have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate.
See Part I, Item 1, Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, and Note 10, Leases and Other Commitments, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of a recently adopted accounting pronouncement that affects our accounting for lease obligations.
Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the quarter ended October 4, 2019.
There were no repurchases of shares of our common stock during the quarter ended October 4, 2019.
