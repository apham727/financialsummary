Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
As of December 28, 2018, we had outstanding the foreign exchange contracts presented in the following table.
During the six months ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, total net realized and unrealized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks, we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures, and there can be no assurance that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term loan A-1 due 2023 bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, of either an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (subject to a 0.0% floor) plus an applicable margin varying from 1.125% to 2.000% or a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0.125% to 1.000%, in each case depending on our corporate credit ratings.
As of December 28, 2018, the applicable margin based on our current credit ratings was 1.5%.
Borrowings under our U.S.
We have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt.
At December 28, 2018, 68% of the par value of our debt was at variable rates.
We previously entered into pay-fixed interest rate swaps, which effectively converts $1.00 billion of our term loans to fixed rates through May 2020 and an incremental $1.00 billion through April 2023.
In January 2019, we entered into an additional pay-fixed interest rate swap agreement to convert $1.00 billion of our term loans to fixed rates from May 2020 through April 2023.
This new interest rate swap agreement, along with our previously existing interest rate swap agreements, effectively converts $2.00 billion of our term loans to fixed rates through 2023.
As of December 28, 2018, we had $7.37 billion of variable rate debt.
After giving effect to the $2.00 billion of interest rate swaps, we effectively had $5.37 billion of long-term debt subject to variations in interest rates and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by $54 million.
For additional information regarding our indebtedness, see Part I, Item 1, Note 7, Debt, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q and Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended June 29, 2018.
