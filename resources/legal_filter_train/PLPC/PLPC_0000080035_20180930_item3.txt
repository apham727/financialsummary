Effective July 1, 2018, Argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy as the projected three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%. As such, beginning July 1, 2018, the functional currency for the Companyâ€™s Argentina subsidiary became the U.S. dollar. The impact to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was immaterial. Revenue from operations in Argentina was less than or equal to 2% of total consolidated net sales for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018. 
The Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate revolving credit facilities and term notes, which consisted of borrowings of $37.9 million at September 30, 2018. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
