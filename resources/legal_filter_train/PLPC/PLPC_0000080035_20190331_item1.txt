For the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, no stock options were excluded in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as there was no anti-dilutive effect.
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, 12,000 stock options, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

The Company maintains an equity award program to give the Company a competitive advantage in attracting, retaining, and motivating officers, employees and directors and to provide an incentive to those individuals to increase shareholder value through long-term incentives directly linked to the Company’s performance.
Under the Preformed Line Products Company Long Term Incentive Plan of 2008 (the “LTIP”), certain employees, officers, and directors were eligible to receive awards of options, restricted shares and restricted share units (RSUs).
The total number of Company common shares reserved for awards under the LTIP was 900,000, of which 800,000 common shares were reserved for RSUs and 100,000 common shares have been reserved for share options.
The LTIP was terminated and replaced with the Preformed Line Products Company 2016 Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) in May 2016 upon approval by the Company’s Shareholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 10, 2016.
No further awards will be made under the LTIP and previously granted awards remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.
The Incentive Plan expires on May 10, 2026.
For the regular annual grants, a portion of the RSUs is subject to time-based cliff vesting and a portion is subject to vesting based upon the Company’s performance over a set period for all participants except the CEO.
All of the CEO’s regular annual RSUs are subject to vesting based upon the Company’s performance over a set-year period.
The RSUs are offered at no cost to the employees.
The fair value of RSUs is based on the market price of a common share on the grant date and the shares are restricted until they vest.
Dividends declared are accrued in cash.
As of March 31, 2019, there was $.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to time-based RSUs that is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining period of approximately 2.1 years.
Depending on the extent to which the performance criterions are satisfied under the LTIP and the Incentive Plan, the participants are eligible to earn common shares over the vesting period.
Performance-based compensation expense for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was $.8 million and $.7 million, respectively.
As of March 31, 2019, the remaining compensation expense of $5.3 million for outstanding performance-based RSU’s is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 1.9 years.
In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the LTIP and the Incentive Plan), vesting of the RSUs will be accelerated and all restrictions will lapse.
Unvested performance-based awards will vest on a target potential payout.
Any additional awards granted will also be issued from the Company’s authorized but unissued shares.
The LTIP permitted and now the Incentive Plan permits the grant of 100,000 options to buy common shares of the Company to certain employees at not less than fair market value of the shares on the date of grant.
Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises will be funded with the issuance of new shares.
The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating fair values of options.
The Company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions.

Assets of the rabbi trust are consolidated, and the value of the Company’s common shares held in the rabbi trust is classified in Shareholders’ equity and generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock.
Changes in the fair value of amounts owed to certain employees or Directors are not recognized as the Company’s deferred compensation plan does not permit diversification and must be settled by the delivery of a fixed number of the Company’s common shares.
As of March 31, 2019, 270,335 shares have been deferred and are being held in the rabbi trust.
Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

These amounts are recorded within Other noncurrent liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
During January 2018, the Company amended the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan to allow the participants the ability to hypothetically invest their proportionate award into various investment options, which primarily includes mutual funds.
The Company credits earnings, gains and losses to the participants’ deferred compensation account balances based on the investments selected by the participants.
The Company measures the fair value of the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan liability using the market values of the participants’ underlying investment accounts.
Additionally, the Company also invested in a Corporate Owned Life Insurance Policy (“COLI”).

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” The amendments in this update require the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements.
Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation for leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance.
Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term.
Initial costs directly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease will be included in the asset.
For leases with a term of 12 months or less, the lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize an asset and corresponding liability.
The lessee is also required to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
The Company applied the transitional package of practical expedients allowed by the standard to not reassess the identification, classification and initial direct costs of leases commencing before this ASU's effective date, however, the Company did not elect the hindsight transitional practical expedient.
The Company also applied the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components to new leases as well as existing leases through transition.
The Company also elected the practical expedient allowed under “Leases (Topic 842)” to exclude leases with a term of twelve months or less form the calculation of the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.
The Company has finalized its policy elections, the discount rate used, data and business processes and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard.
The adoption of this ASU resulted in recognition of right-of-use assets and corresponding current and long-term lease obligations, on a discounted basis, of its lease obligations of $10.4 million on the Company’s balance sheet.
The adoption of ASU 842 did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or debt covenants.
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASU’s.
Recently issued ASU’s that are not listed below were assessed and determined to be not applicable in the current reporting period.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 “Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,” which will modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, including the removal of certain disclosure requirements.
The amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.
An entity is permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of the ASU and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until the effective date.
The Company is currently evaluating what impact its adoption, effective January 1, 2020, will have to the presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
