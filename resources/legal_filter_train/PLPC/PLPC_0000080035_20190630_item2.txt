The segment managers responsible for each region report directly to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, and are accountable for the financial results and performance of their entire segment for which they are responsible. The business components within each segment are managed to maximize the results of the entire operating segment and Company rather than the results of any individual business component of the segment. 
We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on several factors primarily based on sales and net income. 
The operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2019 are compared to the same period in 2018. Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 of $114.8 million increased $5.9 million, or 5%, compared to 2018. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 32.9% in 2019 from 32.3% in 2018. Gross profit for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $37.8 million and $35.2 million, respectively. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, gross profit increased $4.1 million, or 12%, compared to 2018. Costs and expenses of $26.7 million increased $.8 million compared to 2018, including a favorable impact from currency translation of $1.0 million. Operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was $11.1 million, an increase of $1.8 million compared to 2018.

Despite the constant changes in the current global economy, we believe our business fundamentals and our financial position are sound and that we are strategically well-positioned. We remain focused on assessing our business structure, global facilities and overall capacity in conjunction with the requirements of local manufacturing in the markets that we serve. If necessary, we will modify redundant processes and utilize our global manufacturing network to manage costs, increase sales volumes and deliver value to our customers. We have continued to invest in the business to improve efficiency, develop new products, increase our capacity and become an even stronger supplier to our customers. We currently have a bank debt to equity ratio of 26.1% and can borrow needed funds at a competitive interest rate under our credit facility.

Our critical accounting policies are consistent with the information set forth in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed on March 8, 2019 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are, therefore, not presented herein. For more detail regarding the January 1, 2019 adoption of ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” refer to Note Q “Leases” and Note K “Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.” 
We measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operating needs, repay debt, fund additional investments, including acquisitions, and make dividend payments to shareholders. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividends, business acquisitions and access to bank lines of credit. 
Our investments include expenditures required for equipment and facilities as well as expenditures in support of our strategic initiatives. During the first six months of 2019, we used cash of $12.0 million for capital expenditures. We ended the first six months of 2019 with $41.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (“Cash”). Our Cash is held in various locations throughout the world. At June 30, 2019, the majority of our Cash was held outside the United States (“U.S.”). We expect most accumulated non-U.S. Cash balances will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. Cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources. We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing financial statements for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity from customer credit issues. 
Total debt at June 30, 2019 was $67.3 million. At June 30, 2019, our unused availability under our line of credit was $26.9 million and our bank debt to equity percentage was 26.1%. In 2018, we extended the term on our $65 million credit facility from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2021. All other terms remain the same, including the interest rate at LIBOR plus 1.125% unless our funded debt to Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation ratio exceeds 2.25 to 1, at which point the LIBOR spread becomes 1.500%. The line of credit agreement contains, among other provisions, requirements for maintaining levels of net worth and funded debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization along with an interest coverage ratio. The net worth and profitability requirements are calculated based on the line of credit agreement. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
Net Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $5.8 million compared to $7.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018. The $1.9 million decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in net income of $2.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in Cash usage for operating assets (net of operating liabilities) of $1.0 million, which included a decrease resulting from the $5.3 million contribution to the pension plan in 2018 and a decrease in non-cash items of $.3 million. 
The overall demand for cable anchoring and control hardware for electrical transmission and distribution lines on a worldwide basis, which has a slow growth rate in mature markets such as the U.S., Canada, Australia and Western Europe and may grow slowly or experience prolonged delay in developing regions despite expanding power needs; 
Those factors described under the heading “Risk Factors” on page 12 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed on March 8, 2019.
