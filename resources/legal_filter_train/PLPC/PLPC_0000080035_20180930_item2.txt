We measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operating needs, repay debt, fund additional investments, including acquisitions, and make dividend payments to shareholders.
Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividends, business acquisitions and access to bank lines of credit.
During the first nine months of 2018, we used cash of $7.3 million for capital expenditures.
We ended the first nine months of 2018 with $34.3 million of cash and cash equivalents.
At September 30, 2018, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S. We expect most accumulated non-U.S. cash balances will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources.
We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing financial statements for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.

The line of credit agreement contains, among other provisions, requirements for maintaining levels of net worth and funded debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization along with an interest coverage ratio.
The net worth and profitability requirements are calculated based on the line of credit agreement.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with these covenants.
