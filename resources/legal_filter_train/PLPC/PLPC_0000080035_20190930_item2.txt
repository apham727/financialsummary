We measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operating needs, repay debt, fund additional investments, including acquisitions, and make dividend payments to shareholders.
Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividends, business acquisitions and access to bank lines of credit.
During the first nine months of 2019, we used cash of $22.0 million for capital expenditures.
We ended the first nine months of 2019 with $41.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (“Cash”).
At September 30, 2019, the majority of our Cash was held outside the United States (“U.S.”).
We expect most accumulated non-U.S. Cash balances will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. Cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources.
We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing financial statements for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.
At September 30, 2019, our unused availability under our line of credit was $32.9 million and our bank debt to equity percentage was 24.3%.
In 2018, we extended the term on our $65 million credit facility from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2021.
All other terms remain the same, including the interest rate at LIBOR plus 1.125% unless our funded debt to Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation ratio exceeds 2.25 to 1, at which point the LIBOR spread becomes 1.500%.
The line of credit agreement contains, among other provisions, requirements for maintaining levels of net worth and funded debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization along with an interest coverage ratio.
The net worth and profitability requirements are calculated based on the line of credit agreement.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants.
The most significant net investing and financing uses of Cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were payments of long-term debt of $41.6 million, Cash used to fund the acquisition of SubCon and MICOS Telcom of $18.9 million, capital expenditures of $22.0 million, share repurchases of $4.5 million and dividends paid of $3.2 million, partially offset by net debt and notes payable proceeds of $69.3 million.

The change was primarily related to Cash used to fund the SubCon and MICOS Telcom acquisitions, net of Cash, of $18.9 million and a year-over-year increase in capital expenditures of $14.7 million, partially offset by a reduction in Cash used year-over year to purchase marketable securities of $4.2 million in 2018.
The $24.8 million improvement was primarily the result of a net increase in debt borrowings in 2019 compared to 2018 of $26.4 million, partially offset by a year-over-year change in Cash used for net stock repurchases of $1.5 million.
