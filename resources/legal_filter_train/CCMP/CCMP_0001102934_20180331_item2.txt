We assume no obligation to update this forward-looking information.
 In our second quarter of fiscal 2018, we experienced continued strong demand for our products, particularly for memory applications.
This was driven in part by our memory customers' migration from 2D to 3D NAND.
Additionally, continued capacity expansions in 3D NAND are underway, primarily in Korea and China, which should also continue to provide growth opportunities for us in the future.
We believe we remain well positioned to benefit from these long-term demand trends.
The enactment of the Tax Act in the United States in December 2017 facilitated the Company's repatriation of a substantial amount of its non-U.S. cash and available-for-sale securities during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and following the end of the quarter in early April.
Revenue for our second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $143.0 million, which represented an increase of 20.0% from the second quarter of fiscal 2017, with revenue in dielectrics slurries and polishing pads product areas increasing 24.0% and 22.6% from the same quarter last year, respectively.
Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 expressed as a percentage of revenue was 52.5%, compared to 50.4% for our second quarter of fiscal 2017, including 90 and 100-basis point of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively.
Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 52.7% of revenue, compared to 50.1% during the same period last year, which includes 90 and 100-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively.
We currently expect our gross profit margin for the full fiscal year 2018 to be between 51% and 53%, an increase from our prior full year guidance range of 50% to 52%.
This includes approximately 100 basis points of NexPlanar amortization expense.
Operating expenses were $38.0 million in our second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $36.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included $0.5 million in NexPlanar amortization expense.
The increase in operating expenses from the comparable quarter of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and annual merit increases.
We currently expect operating expenses for full fiscal year 2018 to be between $148.0 million and $153.0 million, an increase from our prior full year guidance range of $145.0 million to $150.0 million.
This includes approximately $1.9 million of NexPlanar amortization expense.
The Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.14 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.71 in the same quarter last year.
The increase was primarily due to higher revenue and a higher gross profit margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $1.27.
There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates during the first six months of fiscal 2018.
See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
Revenue was $143.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which represented a 20.0%, or $23.8 million, increase from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in revenue was primarily driven by a $14.3 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $8.3 million increase due to product mix, and a $2.4 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease due to price changes.
Revenue from our tungsten slurries, dielectrics slurries and polishing pads increased 16.6%, 24.0% and 22.6%, respectively, from the comparable period of fiscal 2017.

Other income was $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 353.8%, or $0.8 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to $1.0 million gain on the sale of certain ESF assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and higher interest income of $0.6 million resulting from higher investment balances and higher average interest rates, partially offset by higher foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period of fiscal 2017.
The Company's effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 19.6 percent, compared to 20.8 percent in the same quarter last year.

The increase in revenue was primarily driven by a $27.3 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $14.1 million increase due to product mix, and a $2.3 million increase due to exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease due to price changes.
The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by a $6.1 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $5.3 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense, and a $1.0 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations.

Selling and marketing expenses were $12.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which represented a decrease of 14.8%, or $2.2 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to lower staffing-related costs of $1.1 million, lower severance expense of $0.7 million, and lower information technology expenses of $0.4 million.
Other income was $1.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 41.0%, or $0.5 million, from the six months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to $1.0 million gain on the sale of certain ESF assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and higher interest income of $1.2 million resulting from higher investment balances and higher average interest rates, partially offset by foreign exchange loss in the first six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to foreign exchange gain in the comparable period of fiscal 2017.
Our effective income tax rate was 63.8% for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 20.5% for the six months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in the effective tax rate during the first six months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the one-time unfavorable impact of the Tax Act that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the absence of benefits of a tax holiday in South Korea, which expired as of October 2017, partially offset by the benefit from stock option exercises beginning October 2017.
We generated $67.1 million in cash flows from operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared to $57.9 million in cash from operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2017.
Our cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2018 reflected net income of $26.7 million, $58.4 million in non-cash items, including $24.6 million related to the deemed repatriation transition tax of the Tax Act, and a $18.0 million decrease in cash flow due to a net increase in working capital.
The increase in cash flows from operating activities compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher revenue and gross margin, and also reflected the non-cash impacts of the Tax Act, and changes in the timing and amount of accrued expense payments, including payments related to our STIP, and a higher accounts receivable balance at March 31, 2018, due to an increase in revenue.
In addition, the STIP payment in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 related to our performance in fiscal 2017 was $14.1 million higher than the STIP payment related to our performance in fiscal 2016, which was paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
 In the first six months of fiscal 2018, cash flows used in investing activities were $5.9 million, representing $50.7 million in purchases of investments designated as available-for-sale securities under a managed investment arrangement that were offset by $50.5 million in proceeds upon the subsequent sale of these investments, property, plant and equipment additions of $8.8 million, and the sale of certain ESF assets of $3.0 million.
We continue to expect our total capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 to be within the range of $18.0 million to $22.0 million.
In the first six months of fiscal 2018, cash flows used in financing activities were $8.6 million.
We used $10.2 million to pay dividends and dividend equivalents on our common stock, and $6.6 million to repay long-term debt.
We also used $3.4 million to repurchase common stock pursuant to the terms of our OIP for shares withheld from award recipients to cover payroll taxes on the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the OIP, and used $6.5 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program.
The tax benefit of $6.0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 related to exercises of stock options under the EIP and OIP, and vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded under the OIP is now presented in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2016-09.

Under this program, we repurchased 65,978 shares for $6.6 million during the first six months of fiscal 2018 and we repurchased 36,978 shares for $2.3 million during the first six months of fiscal 2017.
As of March 31, 2018, approximately $115.4 million remained outstanding under our share repurchase program.
Share repurchases are made from time to time, depending on market and other conditions.
The timing, manner, price and amounts of repurchases are determined at the Company's discretion, and the share repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares.
To date, we have funded share purchases under our share repurchase program from our available cash balance, and anticipate we will continue to do so.
Periodically, we also continue the "10b5-1" stock purchase plan agreements with independent brokers to repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with guidelines pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
A plan under Rule 10b5-1 allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods.
Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain conditions specified in the plan.
In January 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the initiation of a regular dividend program under which the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock.
Pursuant to this announcement, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.18 per share, during the second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, and during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.20 per share in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.40 per share, the latest of which we paid in April 2018.
The declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion and determination of the Company's Board of Directors and management, based on a variety of factors, and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
As of March 31, 2018, we had $461.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, $296.3 million of which was held in foreign subsidiaries.
In April 2018, a significant portion of the non-U.S. cash was repatriated to the United States.
We believe that our current balance of cash, cash generated by our operations, cash repatriation to the United States enabled by the Tax Act, and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, expected capital expenditures, merger and acquisition activities, dividend payments, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.
At March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
The following summarizes our contractual obligations at March 31, 2018, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
We have been operating under a multi-year supply agreement with Cabot Corporation, which is not a related party and has not been one since 2002, for the purchase of fumed silica, the current term of which runs through December 31, 2019.
This agreement provides us the option to purchase fumed silica with no minimum purchase requirements as of 2017, for which we have paid a fee of $1.5 million in each of calendar years 2017 and 2018, and for which we will pay the same in 2019.
The purchase obligation in the table above reflect management's expectation that we will meet our forecasted quantities in calendar 2018 and beyond.
Purchase obligations include an aggregate amount of $1.5 million of contractual commitments related to our Cabot Corporation supply agreement for fumed silica.
The $1.5 million payment for calendar 2019 is included in accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2018.
  Interest payments on long-term debt reflect interest rates in effect at March 31, 2018.
The interest payments reflect variable LIBOR-based rates currently in effect on $68.9 million of our outstanding debt, and fixed interest rates on $68.9 million of outstanding debt for which we have implemented interest rate swaps.
Commitment fees are based on our estimated consolidated leverage ratio in future periods.
See Note 8 and Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report onForm 10-Q for additional information regarding our long-term debt.
Under this program, we repurchased 48,728 shares for $5.0 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
As of March 31, 2018, $115.4 million remained outstanding under our share repurchase program.
To date, we have funded share purchases under our share repurchase program from our available cash balance, and anticipate we will continue to do so.
