Except as required by law, Cabot Microelectronics undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements made by it to reflect new information, subsequent events or circumstances.
In the Electronic Materials segment, this quarter we delivered strong growth in both CMP slurries and pads, as well as in KMG’s legacy electronic chemicals business.
Some semiconductor industry analysts are predicting a weaker demand in the first half of the calendar year, with expectations for some strengthening in the second half of calendar 2019, which would indicate a return to a more traditional seasonal pattern for the industry.
Within the memory sector we experienced continued strong demand for our products, particularly for memory applications.
This was driven in part by our memory customers’ migration from 2D to 3D NAND, which requires more CMP processing steps and significantly increases the need for consumables, including tungsten slurries.
In the Performance Materials segment, we also recorded strong revenue, driven by increased demand for our industry leading drag-reducing agents, or DRA’s.
We anticipate future growth for this business with the continued growth in oil production in U.S., primarily in the Permian basin.
Revenue for our first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $221.8 million, which represented an increase of 58.4% from the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Net income was $13.4 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, which was $16.5 million higher than the net loss reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which included a $32.9 million charge related to the Tax Act.
Acquisition-related expenses and a charge for the fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold negatively impacted net income this quarter by $32.5 million.
In addition, higher amortization and depreciation costs associated with purchase accounting adversely impacted net income in the current quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA benefited from improved profitability in the Company’s legacy businesses and the addition of the KMG businesses.
Refer to the “Use of certain GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Information” section below for the calculation of adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA margin, which represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, was 34.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 31.0% for our first quarter of fiscal 2018.
We currently expect our adjusted EBITDA for full fiscal year 2019 to be between $325 million and $355 million.
The Company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.48 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to diluted losses per share of $0.12 in the same quarter last year.
The increase was primarily due to the absence of the adverse impact of the Tax Act in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the inclusion of KMG results, and higher revenue and profitability within the legacy businesses.
These items were partially offset by acquisition-related expenses and higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
Except for the discussion on revenue recognition in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q, no material changes have been made to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the first three months of fiscal 2019.
See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
Revenue was $221.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, which represented a 58.4%, or $81.8 million increase from the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The increase in revenue was primarily due to the Acquisition adding $62.0 million in revenue for the approximately six weeks post-closing in the quarter.
Excluding revenue from KMG businesses, Cabot Microelectronics revenue increased $19.8 million, or 14.1%.
The increase was primarily driven by a $10.1 million increase due to higher sales volume and a $8.2 million increase due to higher value product mix.
Total cost of sales was $122.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 85.6%, or $56.5 million, from the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the Acquisition, adding approximately $52.2 million in cost of sales.
Our gross margin was 44.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, compared to 52.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to higher supplies and equipment costs used in research and development of $0.9 million and higher staffing-related costs of $0.8 million.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $61.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 147.0%, or $36.4 million, from the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to $27.3 million of acquisition and integration related costs, $6.5 million of amortization expense related to the Acquisition, and the addition of $5.1 million in incremental KMG-related costs associated with the approximately six-week post Acquisition.
These items were partially offset by the absence of executive officer transition costs of $2.8 million that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The increase resulted from the debt borrowed to finance the Acquisition.
Other expense was $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 405.7%, or $1.1 million, from $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to higher foreign exchange losses recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2018.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 20.4%, compared to 108.4% in the same quarter last year.
The significant decrease is primarily attributable to the changes introduced by the Tax Act enacted in December 2017.
Excluding the Tax Act discrete adjustments recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the effective tax rate would have been 18.7% for that quarter.
Comparing the adjusted first quarter fiscal 2018 rate to the fiscal 2019 rate for the same period, the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by unfavorable tax treatment of certain KMG acquisition related costs, such as compensation deduction limitations, as well as non-deductibility of certain professional fees.
 Net income was $13.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 536.0%, or $16.5 million, from the net loss reported in the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to the absence of the adverse impact of the Tax Act in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the addition of the KMG business for the approximately six weeks post-closing in the quarter, and higher revenue and profitability within our legacy business.
These items were partially offset by acquisition and integration-related expenses, a charge for fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, as well as increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value.
 Segment data is presented for our two reportable segments for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
The $57.3 million increase in Electronic Materials revenue was driven by the addition of $39.8 million related to KMG’s electronic chemicals business since the Acquisition.
The remaining $17.5 million increase was driven by strong organic demand for the Company’s legacy CMP slurries and polishing pads product lines, which increased 10% and 30%, respectively, primarily on higher sales volume.
Electronic Materials adjusted EBITDA increased from the prior year driven by the addition of approximately six-weeks of KMG’s electronic chemicals results, as well as stronger organic profitability, driven by the leverage achieved on higher sales volume.
The $24.5 million increase in Performance Materials revenue was primarily driven by the addition of $22.2 million related to KMG’s performance materials business for the approximately six-week period post-Acquisition.
Performance Materials’ adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from the prior year due to the addition of KMG’s legacy performance materials business.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for certain items that affect comparability from period to period.
These adjustments include items related to our acquisition of KMG, such as expenses incurred to complete the acquisition, integration related expenses, and impact of fair value adjustments to inventory acquired from KMG.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income.
We generated $13.7 million in cash flows from operating activities in the first three months of fiscal 2019, compared to $30.6 million in cash from operating activities in the first three months of fiscal 2018.
The increase was driven by the use of $1,182 million for the Acquisition.
The remainder of the purchase price was satisfied with the issuance of common stock.
For fiscal 2019, we expect our total capital expenditures to be within the range of $60 million to $70 million.
In the first three months of fiscal 2019, cash flows provided by financing activities were $1,032 million, compared to $7 million used in financing activities in the three months ended December 31, 2018.
During the quarter we received $1,044 million in debt proceeds, net of $21 million in debt issuance costs, which was used for the Acquisition.
In addition, our dividend payments increased by $5 million versus the prior year, driven by the doubling of our quarterly dividend, as announced in March 2018.
The Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are referred to as the “Credit Facilities.” The Company may generally prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR rate loans.
Prepayments of the Term Loan Facility in connection with certain “repricing events” resulting in a lower yield occurring at any time during the first six months after the Acquisition Date must be accompanied by a 1.00% prepayment premium.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company maintain a maximum first lien secured net leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter if any revolving loans are outstanding, commencing with the first full fiscal quarter after the Acquisition Date.
We believe we are in compliance with these covenants.
Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variability in our LIBOR-based interest payments on approximately 70% of our Team Loan balance.
See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Credit Agreement.
As of December 31, 2018, $81.3 million remained available under our share repurchase program.
