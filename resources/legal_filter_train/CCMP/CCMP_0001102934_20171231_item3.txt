Some of our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies.
Consequently, period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.
Approximately 23% of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
We periodically enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
However, we are unlikely to be able to hedge these exposures completely.
During the three months ended December 2017, we recorded $7.1 million in foreign currency translation gains, net of tax, that are included in other comprehensive income.
During fiscal 2017, we recorded $6.7 million in foreign currency translation losses, net of tax, that are included in other comprehensive income.
These gains and losses primarily relate to changes in the U.S. dollar value of assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies when these asset and liability amounts are translated at month-end exchange rates.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts in an effort to protect our net investment in a foreign operation against potential adverse changes resulting from foreign currency fluctuation.
In the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $4.4 million in gross currency translation losses related to this hedge, which are included in other comprehensive income noted above.
We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% additional adverse movement in foreign exchange rates.
At December 31, 2017, we had $141.1 million in debt outstanding on our Term Loan.
In fiscal 2015, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in LIBOR-based interest rate payments on half of our outstanding debt.
As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of this cash flow hedge was $0.4 million.
At December 31, 2017, we had $70.5 million of outstanding debt at a variable rate of interest.
Assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in our current variable interest rate, our interest expense would increase by approximately $0.2 million per quarter.
Beginning in 2008, general uncertainties in the global credit markets significantly reduced liquidity in the ARS market, and this illiquidity continues.
