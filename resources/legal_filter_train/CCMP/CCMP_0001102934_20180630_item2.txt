In our third quarter of fiscal 2018, we experienced continued strong demand for our products, particularly for memory applications.
This was driven in part by our memory customers' migration from 2D to 3D NAND, which requires more CMP processing steps.
Additionally, continued capacity expansions in 3D NAND, primarily in Korea and China, should continue to provide future growth opportunities for us.
We believe we remain well positioned to benefit from these long-term demand trends.
The enactment of the Tax Act in the United States in December 2017 facilitated our repatriation of a substantial amount of non-U.S. cash during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2018.
Revenue for our third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $150.4 million, which represented an increase of 17.6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2017, with revenue in dielectrics slurries, polishing pads and tungsten slurries increasing 21.0%, 18.9% and 17.5%, respectively, from the same quarter last year.
Gross margin, representing gross profit as a percentage of revenue, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 53.6%, compared to 48.9% for our third quarter of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included 90-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense.
Gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was 53.0% of revenue, compared to 49.7% during the same period last year, which includes 90 and 100-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively.
We currently expect our gross margin for the full fiscal year 2018 to be at the high end of our revised guidance range of 52% to 53%, including NexPlanar amortization expense; this is an increase from our prior full year guidance range of 51% to 53%.
Operating expenses were $38.8 million in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $35.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included $0.5 million in NexPlanar amortization expense.
Operating expenses were $113.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to $105.1 million during the same period of fiscal 2017, which include $1.4 million of NexPlanar amortization expense for both periods.
We currently expect operating expenses for full fiscal year 2018 to be between $150.0 million and $155.0 million, an increase from our prior full year guidance range of $148.0 million to $153.0 million.
This includes approximately $1.9 million of NexPlanar amortization expense.
The increase was primarily due to higher revenue and a higher gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
Revenue was $150.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, which represented a 17.6%, or $22.5 million, increase from the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The increase in revenue was primarily driven by a $15.2 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $6.2 million increase due to higher value product mix, and a $1.7 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease due to price changes.
Revenue from our tungsten slurries, dielectrics slurries and polishing pads increased 17.5%, 21.0% and 18.9%, respectively, from the comparable period of fiscal 2017.
Total cost of goods sold was $69.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, which represented an increase of 6.6%, or $4.3 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by a $3.9 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $1.6 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher staffing-related expenses, a $0.9 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations, and a $0.8 million increase due to product mix, partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in other variable manufacturing costs, including material costs.
Our gross margin was 53.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to 48.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2017.

The decrease was primarily due to the absence of an impairment charge of $0.9 million that occurred in the three months ended June 30, 2017, lower supplies and equipment costs used in research and development of $0.5 million, and lower professional expenses of $0.3 million, partially offset by the absence of a gain on equipment disposal of $0.6 million that occurred in the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Selling and marketing expenses were $6.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, which represented a decrease of 15.5%, or $1.1 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The decrease was primarily due to lower staffing-related costs of $0.5 million, the absence of amortization expense of $0.3 million resulting from an intangible asset becoming fully amortized in the prior quarter, and lower information technology expenses of $0.2 million.
General and administrative expenses were $19.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, which represented an increase of 39.8%, or $5.6 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The decrease resulted from the payoff of our Term Loan in April 2018.
Other income was $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, which represented an increase of 1,514.8%, or $1.7 million, from other expense of $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to lower foreign exchange loss of $0.6 million, higher interest income of $0.5 million resulting from higher average interest rates, and gain on the termination of interest rate swap agreements of $0.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The Company's effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 18.3%, compared to 22.4% in the same quarter last year.

Total cost of goods sold was $203.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, which represented an increase of 9.3%, or $17.3 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2017.

Our effective income tax rate was 47.0% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 21.1% for the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
The increase in the effective tax rate during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the unfavorable initial impact of the Tax Act that was enacted in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the absence of benefits of the tax holiday in South Korea, which expired as of October 2017, partially offset by the benefit from stock option exercises beginning October 2017 and benefits related to changes in prior year tax positions.
Net income was $61.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, which represented an increase of 2.3%, or $1.4 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
The increase was primarily due to higher revenue and a higher gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses and the $32.6 million initial unfavorable impact of the Tax Act enacted in December 2017.
We generated $104.0 million in cash flows from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to $90.0 million in cash from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
Our cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 reflected net income of $61.8 million, $69.7 million in non-cash items, including $24.6 million related to the deemed repatriation transition tax of the Tax Act, and a $27.5 million decrease in cash flow due to a net increase in working capital.
The increase in cash flows from operating activities compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher revenue and gross margin, partially offset by a higher increase in working capital.
In addition, the STIP payment related to our performance in fiscal 2017, which we made in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, was $14.1 million higher than the STIP payment related to our performance in fiscal 2016, which was paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
 In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, cash flows used in investing activities were $145.3 million, representing $178.4 million in purchases of investments designated as available-for-sale securities under a managed investment arrangement that were offset by $55.2 million in proceeds upon the subsequent sale of part of these investments, property, plant and equipment additions of $15.2 million, and payment for net investment hedge termination of $9.9 million, partially offset by $3.0 million of cash received for the sale of certain ESF assets that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, cash flows used in investing activities were $15.1 million, representing $15.3 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.6 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.
We continue to expect our total capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 to be within the range of $18.0 million to $22.0 million.
We used $144.4 million to payoff the Term Loan, $33.1 million to repurchase common stock, and $20.5 million to pay dividends and dividend equivalents on our common stock.
We received $27.6 million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options granted under our EIP and OIP, and for the sale of shares to employees under our ESPP, and $5.8 million in tax benefits related to exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the EIP and OIP.
We used $5.9 million to repurchase common stock, $14.0 million to pay dividends and dividend equivalents on our common stock, and $7.6 million to repay long-term debt.
As of June 30, 2018, approximately $91.9 million remained outstanding under our share repurchase program.
Share repurchases are made from time to time, depending on market and other conditions.
The timing, manner, price and amounts of repurchases are determined at the Company's discretion, and the share repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares.
To date, we have funded share purchases under our share repurchase program from our available cash balance, and anticipate we will continue to do so.
Periodically, we also continue the "10b5-1" stock purchase plan agreements with independent brokers to repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with guidelines pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
A plan under Rule 10b5-1 allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods.
Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain conditions specified in the plan.
In January 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the initiation of a regular dividend program under which the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock.
Pursuant to this announcement, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.18 per share, during the second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, and during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.20 per share in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, and during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.40 per share, the latest of which we paid in July 2018.
The declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion and determination of the Company's Board of Directors and management, based on a variety of factors, and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
As of June 30, 2018, we had $186.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, $112.4 million of which was held in foreign subsidiaries.
We believe that our current balance of cash and available-for-sale securities, cash generated by our operations, cash repatriation to the United States enabled by the Tax Act, and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, expected capital expenditures, dividend payments, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.
At June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
The following summarizes our contractual obligations at June 30, 2018, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
We have been operating under a multi-year supply agreement with Cabot Corporation, which is not a related party and has not been one since 2002, for the purchase of fumed silica, the current term of which runs through December 31, 2019.
This agreement provides us the option to purchase fumed silica with no minimum purchase requirements as of 2017, for which we have paid a fee of $1.5 million in each of calendar years 2017 and 2018, and for which we will pay the same in 2019.
The purchase obligation in the table above reflect management's expectation that we will meet our forecasted quantities in calendar 2018 and beyond.
Purchase obligations include an aggregate amount of $1.5 million of contractual commitments related to our Cabot Corporation supply agreement for fumed silica.
The $1.5 million payment for calendar 2019 is included in accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2018.
Under this program, we repurchased 210,814 shares for $23.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
As of June 30, 2018, $91.9 million remained outstanding under our share repurchase program.
To date, we have funded share purchases under our share repurchase program from our available cash balance, and anticipate we will continue to do so.
