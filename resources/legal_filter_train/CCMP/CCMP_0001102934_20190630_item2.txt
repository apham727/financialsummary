Except as required by law, Cabot Microelectronics undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements made by it to reflect new information, subsequent events or circumstances.
In the Electronic Materials segment, we recorded lower CMP slurries revenue, which was partially offset by higher revenue in CMP pads and electronic chemicals.
CMP slurries have a high participation to memory, and were adversely impacted by the decrease in DRAM and NAND production at our customers this year.
In logic applications, the transition to advanced nodes by many of our top customers is driving increased demand for materials, particularly electronic chemicals.
In our Performance Materials segment, we continue to record strong revenue this quarter, primarily driven by higher demand for our drag-reducing agents.
These products enable pipeline operators to optimize the efficiency and throughput of oil transport in both U.S. and international oil production.
Revenue for our third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $271.9 million, which represented an increase of 80.7% from the same quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
Results benefited from the Acquisition, but were more than offset by acquisition-related expenses, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition, costs related to the KMG-Bernuth warehouse fire that occurred in May 2019, and increased tax expense related to newly issued final regulations related to US Tax Reform which impacted our reserves for uncertain tax positions.
For the same reasons, diluted earnings per share decrease from $1.34 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to $0.64 in the current quarter.
This represents an increase of $36.9 million, or a 75.6% increase from the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses, partially offset by the softer industry conditions that resulted in lower demand for Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage CMP products.
Refer to the “Use of certain GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Information” section below for the definition of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure.
Except for the discussion on revenue recognition in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q, no material changes have been made to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
Revenue was $271.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an 80.7%, or $121.4 million, increase from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
Total cost of sales was $156.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 124.4%, or $86.8 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
Our gross margin was 42.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to 53.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Total research, development and technical expenses were $12.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 6.6%, or $0.9 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Our research, development and technical efforts are focused on the areas of research related to fundamental CMP technology; development of new and enhanced CMP consumable products, including collaboration on joint development projects with technology-leading customers and suppliers; process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products; technical support of CMP products in our customers’ research, development and manufacturing facilities; and, development of polishing and metrology applications outside of the semiconductor industry.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $51.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 98.2%, or $25.2 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018.
These items were partially offset by $1.6 million lower staffing-related costs, including incentive compensation costs.
Interest expense was $12.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of $12.2 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase resulted from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
Other expense was $0.5 million for three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to other income of $0.5 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The change was primarily due to higher loss on foreign exchange in the current quarter and the absence of the gain on termination of interest rate swap agreements of $0.5 million that had occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The Company’s effective income tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 52.1%, compared to 18.3% in the same quarter last year.
The increase is primarily driven by a discrete charge of $9,128 related to newly issued final regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform which impacted the Company’s reserves for uncertain tax positions.
Net income was $18.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 46.3%, or $16.3 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Net income benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses, and was partially offset by acquisition and integration-related expenses, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition, KMG-Bernuth warehouse fire related costs, and discrete charge of $9,128 related to newly issued final regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform which impacted the Company’s reserves for uncertain tax positions.
Revenue was $759.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a 75.1%, or $325.7 million increase from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase in revenue was primarily due to the Acquisition.
Revenue from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses increased slightly by $9.0 million, or 2.1%.
This increase was primarily driven by a higher value product mix, selected price increases, partially offset by lower sales volume.
Total cost of sales was $429.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 110.9%, or $225.9 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the Acquisition.
Our gross margin was 43.4% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to 53.0% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
Total research, development and technical expenses were $39.0 million for nine months ended June 30, 2019, which was relatively flat compared to the same period last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $162.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 116.4%, or $87.4 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
These items were partially offset by the absence of executive officer transition costs of $4.2 million that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Interest expense was $33.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of $30.2 million from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase resulted from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
Interest income was $2.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 38.3%, or $1.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 due to lower cash balances.
Other expense was $2.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to other income of $0.1 million from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The change was primarily due to higher loss on foreign exchange, and the absence of the gain on sale of assets of $1.0 million and gain on the termination of interest rate swap agreements that occurred in the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The Company’s effective income tax rate was 36.9% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to 47.0% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to the Tax Act enacted in December 2017 which reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a change in our blended tax rate of 24.5% in fiscal 2018 to 21.0% beginning with our fiscal 2019.
Net income was $59.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 3.8%, or $2.4 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
Net income benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses, and the absence of the adverse impact of the Tax Act in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Net income was partially offset by acquisition and integration-related expenses, a charge for fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition, and the increased tax expense related to newly issued final regulations related to US Tax Reform which impacted our reserves for uncertain tax positions.
Segment data is presented for our two reportable segments for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
The segment data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-Q.
The $68.3 million increase in Electronic Materials revenue was driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals business in the quarter, partially offset by the decrease in the sale of Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage CMP slurries products primarily due to softer industry conditions that resulted in lower demand for the Company’s products.
The $53.1 million increase in Performance Materials revenue was primarily driven by the addition of KMG’s performance materials business in the quarter.
Performance Materials’ adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from the prior year due to the addition of KMG’s heritage performance materials business.
The $202.4 million increase in Electronic Materials revenue was driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals business since the Acquisition.
The remaining increase was driven by higher value product mix, strong organic demand for the Company’s heritage CMP polishing pads product line, which increased 11.1%, primarily on higher sales volume, partially offset by the decrease in Company's heritage CMP slurries products due to the softer industry conditions.
Electronic Materials adjusted EBITDA increased from the prior year driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals results, as well as stronger profitability, driven by the leverage achieved on higher sales volume of the Company’s heritage CMP polishing pads product line.
The $123.3 million increase in Performance Materials revenue was primarily driven by the addition of KMG’s performance materials business post-Acquisition.
Performance Materials’ adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from the prior year due to the addition of KMG’s heritage performance materials business.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for certain items that affect comparability from period to period.
These adjustments include items related to our acquisition of KMG, such as expenses incurred to complete the acquisition, integration related expenses, and impact of fair value adjustments to inventory acquired from KMG.
The non-GAAP financial information provided is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the investor's understanding about the Company's ongoing operations.
A reconciliation table of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is contained below.
Adjusted EBITDA for the Electronic Materials and Performance Materials segments is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting.
This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance.
The table below presents the reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income.
We generated $117.0 million in cash flows from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to $104.0 million in cash from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
The increase in operating cash flows of $13.0 million was due to an increase of net income adjusted for non-cash reconciling items.
The increase was driven by the use of $1,182 million for the Acquisition.
Capital expenditures in the first nine months were $32.7 million, compared to $15.2 million in the prior year.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2019, cash flows provided by financing activities were $908.7 million, compared to $177.7 million used in financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we received $1,044 million in debt proceeds, net of $21.4 million in debt issuance costs and original issue discount fees, which was used for the Acquisition.
In addition, our dividend payments increased by $13.6 million versus the prior year, driven by the doubling of our quarterly dividend, as announced in March 2018, and the new shares issued in connection with the Acquisition.
The Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are referred to as the “Credit Facilities.” The Company may generally prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR rate loans.
We made a prepayment of $55 million and a total prepayment of $100.0 million during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company maintain a maximum first lien secured net leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter if any revolving loans are outstanding, commencing with the first full fiscal quarter after the Acquisition Date.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default.
We believe we are in compliance with these covenants.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variability in our LIBOR-based interest payments on approximately 70% of our Team Loan balance.
See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Credit Agreement.
As of June 30, 2019, $76.3 million remained available under our share repurchase program.
Share repurchases are made from time to time, depending on market and other conditions.
The timing, manner, price and amounts of repurchases are determined at the Company's discretion, and the share repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares.
Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain conditions specified in the plan.
The declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion and determination of the Board of Directors and management, based on a variety of factors, and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
As of June 30, 2019, we had $168.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $118.4 million of which was held in foreign subsidiaries.
We believe that our current balance of cash, cash generated by our operations, cash repatriation to the United States, and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, expected capital expenditures, dividend payments, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.
At June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
We have been operating under a multi-year supply agreement with Cabot Corporation, which has not been a related party since 2002, for the purchase of fumed silica, the current term of which runs through December 31, 2019.
Interest payments on long-term debt reflect interest rates in effect at December 31, 2018.
The interest payments reflect variable LIBOR-based rates currently in effect on $216.3 million of our outstanding debt, and fixed rates on $746 million of outstanding debt for which we have implemented an interest rate swap.
Commitment fees are based on our estimated consolidated leverage ratio in future periods.
See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our long-term debt.
The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the company’s acquisition of KMG (the “Acquisition”), which was consummated on November 15, 2018 (the “Acquisition Date”), based on the historical results of operations of Cabot Microelectronics and KMG.
See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, and Note 4, Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Acquisition.
These pro forma financials include actual KMG’s pre-Acquisition results with the months aligned to Cabot Microelectronics’ fiscal periods, and therefore, they do not align with consolidated financial statements included in KMG’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
• The exchange of 0.2000 share(s) of Cabot Microelectronics common stock for each share of KMG common stock; and
We utilized estimated fair values at the Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The allocation may be adjusted for up to one-year post closing.
In addition, the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income do not reflect any additional anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, cost savings, or any integration costs that may result from the Acquisition.
As a result, under SEC Regulation S-X Article 11, certain non-recurring expenses such as deal costs and compensation expenses related to severance or accelerated stock compensation and certain non-cash costs related to the fair value step-up of inventory are eliminated from pro forma results in the periods presented.
In contrast, under the ASC 805 presentation in Note 4, Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements, these expenses are required to be included in prior year pro forma results.
1 Pro forma adjustments are related to non-recurring items directly attributable to the transaction as well as recurring differences related to amortization or financing costs that were included as if the companies were combined as of October 1, 2017.
On November 15, 2018, the Acquisition was completed and actual combined company results are included.
2 Heritage KMG results that occurred prior to the Acquisition on November 15, 2018.
4 Certain pro forma adjustments related to depreciation, amortization, financing costs and costs of sales have been made for the October 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 period assuming that the Acquisition occurred on October 1, 2017.
Additionally, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments have been made for deal costs, compensation expenses related to severance or accelerated stock compensation, and the fair value step-up of inventory directly attributable throughout the nine-month period.
1 Shares outstanding for KMG are from KMG's filed 10-Q for the three months ended April 30, 2018.
They are intended for illustrative purposes only and do not impact pro forma EPS calculations at right.
Three months ended June 30, 2018 KMG share calculations were not available.
3 Pro forma adjustments are related to items directly attributable to the transaction, such as recurring differences related to depreciation, amortization or financing costs that were included as if the companies were combined as of October 1, 2017.
They are intended for illustrative purposes only and do not impact pro forma EPS calculations at right.
Nine months ended June 30, 2018 KMG share calculations were not available.
3 Pro forma adjustments are related to items directly attributable to the transaction, such as recurring differences related to depreciation, amortization, compensation or financing costs that were included as if the companies were combined as of October 1, 2017.
We calculated the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using a 22.1% and 23.4% tax rate, which represent the weighted average statutory tax rate for nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 and year-ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
Additionally, for the 2018 periods presented, we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding the Cabot Microelectronics weighted average number of basic shares outstanding from the share amounts disclosed in the historical Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the amount of shares issued in connection with the Acquisition, as if the shares were held for the entire period.
We calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding by adding the number of shares issued in the Acquisition to the amount disclosed in the historical Cabot Microelectronics Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The basic and diluted EPS calculation takes pro forma net income divided by the applicable number of shares outstanding.
•Removal of amortization of acquisition related intangibles, since management believes that these costs are not indicative of the company’s core operating performance.
•Adjustment for U.S. Tax Reform, which represents a significant non-recurring item affecting comparability among periods.
•Removal of certain costs related to a warehouse fire at KMG-Bernuth.
Under this program, we repurchased 48,007 shares for $5.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
As of June 30, 2019, $76.3 million remained outstanding under our share repurchase program.
To date, we have funded share purchases under our share repurchase program from our available cash balance, and anticipate we will continue to do so.
