Some of our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies.
Consequently, period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.
Approximately 31% of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
We periodically enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
However, we are unlikely to be able to hedge these exposures completely.
We do not enter into forward contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
Fluctuations in foreign currencies have not had a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
During the six months ended March 31, 2019, we recorded $1.4 million in foreign currency translation gains, net of tax, that are included in other comprehensive income.
These gains and losses primarily relate to changes in the U.S. dollar value of assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies when these asset and liability amounts are translated at month-end exchange rates.
We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% additional adverse movement in foreign exchange rates.
