Some of our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies.
Consequently, period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.
Approximately 26% of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
We periodically enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
However, we are unlikely to be able to hedge these exposures completely.
We do not enter into forward contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
During the nine months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded $2.3 million in foreign currency translation gains, net of tax, that are included in other comprehensive income.
These gains and losses primarily relate to changes in the U.S. dollar value of assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies when these asset and liability amounts are translated at month-end exchange rates.
We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% additional adverse movement in foreign exchange rates.
At June 30, 2018, we owned one auction rate security (ARS) with a total estimated fair and par value $4.0 million, which was classified as other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Beginning in 2008, general uncertainties in the global credit markets significantly reduced liquidity in the ARS market, and this illiquidity continues.
For more information on our ARS, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q.
