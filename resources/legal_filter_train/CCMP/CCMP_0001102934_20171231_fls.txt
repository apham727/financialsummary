This Act provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves so long as they identify these statements as forward-looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results.
All statements other than statements of historical fact we make in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking.
In particular, the statements herein regarding future sales and operating results; growth or contraction of, and trends in, the industry and markets in which the Company participates; the Company's management; various economic or political factors and international or national events; regulatory or legislative activity, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") in December 2017 in the United States; product performance; the generation, protection and acquisition of intellectual property, and litigation related to such intellectual property; new product introductions; development of new products, technologies and markets; the Company's supply chain; the financial conditions of the Company's customers; natural disasters; the acquisition of or investment in, or collaboration with other entities; uses and investment of the Company's cash balance, including dividends and share repurchases, which may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, based on a variety of factors; financing facilities and related debt, payment of principal and interest, and compliance with covenants and other terms; the Company's capital structure; the Company's current or future tax rate, including the effects of Tax Act; the operation of facilities by the Company; and statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words "intends," "estimates," "plans," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "should," "could" or similar expressions, are forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations and are inherently uncertain.
The section entitled "Risk Factors" describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause these differences.
