Cognex Corporation is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks, primarily in manufacturing processes, where vision is required.
In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.
Cognex machine vision is primarily used to automate manufacturing and distribution processes in a variety of industries where the technology is widely recognized as an important component of automated production and quality assurance.
Virtually every manufacturer can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, Cognex products are used by a broad base of customers across a variety of industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices.
Cognex products are also used outside of the manufacturing sector to automate distribution processes in the logistics industry for applications in retail distribution and ecommerce to scan, track, and sort goods through distribution centers.
Unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead costs over a declining inventory balance contributed to a decrease in the gross margin percentage to 73% of revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 76% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018.
Operating expenses increased by 2% over the prior year's first quarter due principally to the impact of headcount additions to support our future growth plans.
Operating income was 17% of revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 20% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018; net income was 19% of revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 22% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018; and net income per diluted share was $0.19 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $0.21 in the first quarter of 2018.
Constant-currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.
We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant-currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes.
Results on a constant-currency basis are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Revenue for the first quarter of 2019 totaled $173,484,000, representing an increase of $3,917,000, or 2%, from the first quarter of 2018.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a decrease in revenue of approximately 3%, as sales denominated in Euros and Chinese Yuan were translated to U.S.
Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, constant-currency revenue increased by approximately 5% from the first quarter of 2018.
Sales to customers based in the Americas increased by 10% driven by strong sales in the logistics industry, partially offset by lower sales in the automotive industry.
Sales to customers based in Europe increased by 6%, or 12% on a constant-currency basis, across a variety of industries with the highest growth coming from the logistics industry.
Sales to customers based in other regions in Asia decreased by 4%.
As of the date of this report, we expect revenue for the full year of 2019 will be slightly lower than 2018 as higher revenue in logistics, among other industries, is expected to be more than offset by significantly lower revenue in consumer electronics-one of our largest end markets.
For the second quarter of 2019, we expect revenue will be higher than the first quarter of 2019, but lower than the second quarter of 2018.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 73% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 76% for the first quarter of 2018.
As of the date of this report, we expect the gross margin percentage to be in the mid 70s range for the second quarter of 2019.
rates also resulted in a lower level of expenses, as costs denominated in foreign currencies were translated to U.S.
Foreign currency gains and losses result primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany balances that are reported in one currency and collected in another.
The increase was due to higher yields on the Company's portfolio of debt securities, and to a lesser extent additional funds available for investment.
Other income included a net benefit of $985,000 and $442,000 in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, from the revaluation of contingent consideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions.
The Company’s effective tax rate was 7% and 2% of pre-tax income for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $2,730,000 and $4,935,000 in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises.
The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods.
Excluding the impact of these discrete tax events, the Company’s effective tax rate was 15% of pre-tax income for both the first quarters of 2019 and 2018.
The Company has historically been able to generate positive cash flow from operations, which has funded its operating activities and other cash requirements and has resulted in an accumulated cash and investment balance of $863,687,000 as of March 30, 2019.
The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings, diversification, and maturities of its investments that maintain liquidity.
The Company’s cash requirements in the first quarter of 2019 were primarily met with positive cash flows from operations.
Cash requirements consisted of operating activities, the payment of dividends, and capital expenditures.
Operating cash outflows included the payment of company bonuses that were earned and accrued in 2018.
Capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled $5,078,000 and consisted of manufacturing test equipment related to new product introductions, as well as improvements made to the Company's headquarters building in Natick, Massachusetts and various leased facilities.
In October 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $200,000,000 of the Company's common stock.
As of March 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 203,000 shares at a cost of $8,622,000 under this program, leaving a remaining balance of $191,378,000.
The Company’s Board of Directors declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2019, amounting to $8,564,000.
Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board deems relevant including, among other things, the Company’s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations.
The Company believes that its existing cash and investment balances, together with cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet its operating, investing, and financing activities for the next twelve months.
As of March 30, 2019, the Company had $863,687,000 in cash and investments.
In addition, the Company has no long-term debt and does not anticipate needing debt financing in the near future.
We believe that our strong cash position has put us in a relatively good position with respect to our longer-term liquidity needs.
