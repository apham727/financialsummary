Cognex Corporation is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks, primarily in manufacturing processes, where vision is required. In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.
The Company’s customers are predominantly in the factory automation market. Factory automation customers purchase Cognex products and incorporate them into their manufacturing processes. Customers in the consumer electronics and automotive industries contribute the largest percentage to the Company's factory automation revenue. Most manufacturers can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, this market also includes a broad base of customers across a variety of other industries, including consumer products, food and beverage, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals. Factory automation customers also purchase Cognex products for use outside of the manufacturing process, such as using ID products in logistics automation for package sorting and distribution. A small percentage of the Company’s customers are in the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment market. These customers purchase Cognex products and integrate them into the automation equipment that they manufacture and then sell to their customers to either make semiconductor chips or assemble printed circuit boards. 
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," using the full retrospective method to present all periods reported on a consistent basis. Accordingly, prior period revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit have been restated to apply the provisions of this ASC.
Revenue for the second quarter of 2018 totaled $211,264,000, representing an increase of 19% from the second quarter of 2017 driven primarily by strong sales in the logistics and automotive industries. The gross margin percentage 
Revenue increased by $33,184,000, or 19%, for the three-month period and increased by $63,712,000, or 20%, for the six-month period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily related to the translation of Euro-denominated revenue to U.S. Dollars, accounted for approximately 4% of the revenue increase in both periods. The remaining constant-currency revenue increases came from higher sales in a variety of industries, with the largest contributions coming from the logistics and automotive industries.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 74% and 75% for the three-month and six-month periods in 2018, respectively, compared to 76% for both periods in 2017. Although a higher volume of products sold resulted in manufacturing efficiencies, this favorable impact was offset by a greater percentage of revenue related to application-specific customer solutions. These solutions typically have lower gross margins due to the application configuration and deployment services included as part of the solution, as well as on-site support services provided after the solution is deployed. In addition, these solutions are often provided to large customers that may receive favorable pricing.
The Company's gross margin percentage has ranged in the mid 70s for the past several years. As of the date of this report, we expect the gross margin percentage to be relatively flat for the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the second quarter of 2018.
The Company recorded foreign currency losses of $195,000 and $329,000 for the three-month and six-month periods in 2018, respectively, compared to foreign currency losses of $184,000 and $447,000 for the three-month and six-month period in 2017. Foreign currency gains and losses result primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany balances that are reported in one currency and collected in another. 
Investment income increased by $1,421,000, or 66%, for the three-month period and increased by $2,649,000, or 64%, for the six-month period. The increase was due to higher yields on the Company's portfolio of debt securities, as well as additional funds available for investment.
The Company’s effective tax rate was an expense of 16% and 11% of pre-tax income for the three-month and six-month periods in 2018, respectively, compared to an expense of 9% of pre-tax income and a benefit of 1% of pre-tax income for the same periods in 2017.
The effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $654,000 and $5,589,000 for the three-month and six-month periods in 2018, respectively, and $5,787,000 and $18,954,000 for the same periods in 2017 from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises. The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods. 
The Company has historically been able to generate positive cash flow from operations, which has funded its operating activities and other cash requirements and has resulted in an accumulated cash and investment balance of $754,883,000 as of July 1, 2018. The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings, diversification, and maturities of its investments that maintain liquidity.
The Company’s cash requirements during the six months ended July 1, 2018 were met with positive cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the proceeds from stock option exercises. Cash requirements consisted of operating activities, investment purchases, the repurchase of common stock, the payment of dividends, and capital expenditures. Operating cash outflows included the purchase of inventory for large customer orders already received or anticipated to be received that are expected to ship and generate revenue later in 2018.
In April 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $100,000,000 of the Company's common stock. As of July 1, 2018, the Company repurchased 1,744,000 shares at a cost of $100,000,000 under this program, including 803,000 shares at a cost of $45,200,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Stock repurchases under this April 2017 program were completed in the first quarter of 2018. In February, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $150,000,000 of the Company's common stock. Purchases under this February 2018 program commenced during the first quarter of 2018. As of July 1, 2018, the Company repurchased 1,553,000 shares at a cost of $76,108,000 under this program, leaving a remaining authorized balance of $73,892,000. Total stock repurchases in the six-month period ended July 1, 2018 amounted to $121,308,000. The Company may repurchase 
shares under this program in future periods depending on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the impact of dilution from employee stock options, stock price, share availability, and cash requirements.
The Company’s Board of Directors declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.0450 per share in the first and second quarters of 2018, amounting to $15,524,000 for the six-month period ended July 1, 2018. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board deems relevant including, among other things, the Company’s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations.
The Company believes that its existing cash and investment balances, together with cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet its operating, investing, and financing activities for the next twelve months. As of July 1, 2018, the Company had $754,883,000 in cash and investments. In addition, Cognex has no long-term debt and does not anticipate needing debt financing in the near future. We believe that our strong cash position has put us in a relatively good position with respect to our longer-term liquidity needs.
