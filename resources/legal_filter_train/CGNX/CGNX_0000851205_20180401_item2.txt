Cognex Corporation is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks, primarily in manufacturing processes, where vision is required. In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.
The Company’s customers are predominantly in the factory automation market. Factory automation customers purchase Cognex products and incorporate them into their manufacturing processes. Customers in the consumer electronics and automotive industries contribute the largest percentage to the Company's factory automation revenue. Most manufacturers can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, this market also includes a broad base of customers across a variety of other industries, including consumer products, food and beverage, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals. Factory automation customers also purchase Cognex products for use outside of the manufacturing process, such as using ID products in logistics automation for package sorting and distribution. A small percentage of the Company’s customers are in the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment market. These customers purchase Cognex products and integrate them into the automation equipment that they manufacture and then sell to their customers to either make semiconductor chips or assemble printed circuit boards. 
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," using the full retrospective method to present all periods reported on a consistent basis. Accordingly, prior period revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit have been restated to apply the provisions of this ASC.
Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $169,567,000, representing an increase of 22% from the first quarter of 2017 driven primarily by strong sales in the logistics and automotive industries. A shift in revenue mix toward service-
related revenue resulted in a slight decline in the gross margin percentage to 76% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 77% of revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses increased by 37% over the prior year due principally to the impact of headcount additions to support the higher revenue level and future growth plans. The operating income margin was 20% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 27% of revenue in the first quarter of 2017. A lower tax benefit related to stock option exercises than the prior year resulted in a net income margin of 22% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 33% of revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Net income per diluted share was $0.21 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.25 in the first quarter of 2017.
Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $169,567,000, representing an increase of $30,528,000, or 22%, from the first quarter of 2017. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily related to the translation of Euro-denominated revenue to U.S. Dollars, accounted for approximately 5% of the revenue increase. The remaining constant-currency increase of 17% was driven by higher sales in the logistics and automotive industries, partially offset by lower sales in the consumer electronics industry.
As of the date of this report, we expect revenue for the second quarter of 2018 to increase sequentially from the first quarter of 2018. Although we expect this growth to come from a variety of industries, the most notable increase is expected to come from the consumer electronics industry due to the quarterly timing of revenue from large customer orders in this industry, which in turn is dependent upon the product introduction cycles of these customers. Despite the level of quarterly revenue currently anticipated from customers in the consumer electronics industry in the second quarter of 2018, we expect consumer electronics revenue to be lower for the full year 2018 as compared to 2017.
The Company's gross margin percentage has ranged from the mid-to-high 70s for the past several years. As of the date of this report, we expect the gross margin percentage to be closer to the mid-point of this range in the second quarter of 2018 due to anticipated higher revenue from a material customer under a preferred pricing arrangement.
Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses increased by $8,306,000, or 36%, for the three-month period as detailed in the table below (in thousands).
The Company recorded other income of $277,000 and $270,000 for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other income (expense) includes fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions, as well as rental income, net of associated expenses, from leasing space in buildings adjacent to the Company’s corporate headquarters.
The Company’s effective tax rate was an expense of 2% of pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2018 and a benefit of 16% of pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2017.
The effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $4,935,000 in the first quarter of 2018 and $13,167,000 in the first quarter of 2017 from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises. The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods. 
The Company has historically been able to generate positive cash flow from operations, which has funded its operating activities and other cash requirements and has resulted in an accumulated cash and investment balance of $803,382,000 as of April 1, 2018. The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings, diversification, and maturities of its investments that maintain liquidity.
The Company’s cash requirements during the first quarter of 2018 were met with positive cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the proceeds from stock option exercises. Cash requirements consisted of operating activities, investment purchases, the repurchase of common stock, the payment of dividends, and capital expenditures. Operating cash inflows included the collection of a significant amount of accounts receivable from a material customer in the consumer electronics industry. Operating cash outflows included the purchase of inventory for large customer orders already received or anticipated to be received that are expected to ship and generate revenue later in 2018, as well as the payment of company bonuses that were earned and accrued in 2017.
In April 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $100,000,000 of the Company's common stock. As of April 1, 2018, the Company repurchased 1,744,000 shares at a cost of $100,000,000 under this program, including 803,000 shares at a cost of $45,200,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Stock repurchases under this April 2017 program are now complete. In February, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $150,000,000 of the Company's common stock. As of April 1, 2018, the Company repurchased 453,000 shares at a cost of $24,002,000 under this program, leaving a remaining authorized balance of $125,998,000. Total stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2018 amounted to $69,202,000. The Company may repurchase shares under this program in future periods depending on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the impact of dilution from employee stock options, stock price, share availability, and cash requirements.
The Company’s Board of Directors declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.045 per share in the first quarter of 2018, amounting to $7,787,000. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board deems relevant including, among other things, the Company’s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations.
The Company’s business strategy includes selective expansion into new machine vision markets and applications through the acquisition of businesses and technologies. The Company has completed seven business acquisitions since August 2015, none of which are significant individually or in the aggregate to the Company's financial positions or operating results. Certain of these acquisitions have contractual obligations for deferred cash payments, contingent cash payments tied to performance, and special incentive cash payments tied to employment, none of which are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company's cash flows.
The Company believes that its existing cash and investment balances, together with cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet its operating, investing, and financing activities for the next twelve months. As of April 1, 2018, the Company had $803,382,000 in cash and investments. In addition, Cognex has no long-term debt and does not
