Cognex Corporation is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks, primarily in manufacturing processes, where vision is required. In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.
Cognex machine vision is primarily used to automate manufacturing and distribution processes in a variety of industries where the technology is widely recognized as an important component of automated production and quality assurance. Virtually every manufacturer can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, Cognex products are used by a broad base of customers across a variety of industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Cognex products are also used to automate distribution processes in the logistics industry for applications in retail distribution and ecommerce to scan, track, and sort goods through distribution centers.
Sales to customers based in the Americas increased by 14% for the three-month period and 11% for the nine-month period driven by higher sales in the logistics industry, partially offset by lower sales in the automotive industry. Sales to customers based in Europe decreased by 46% for the three-month period and 26% for the nine-month period driven by lower sales in the consumer electronics industry, and to a lessor extent, the automotive industry. Sales to customers based in Greater China decreased by 10% for the three-month period and 13% for the nine-month period due to lower sales across a variety of industries. The decline would have been larger in Greater China, and less extreme in Europe, if not for procurement changes made by certain consumer electronics customers, shifting their purchases to China from Europe. Sales to customers based in other regions in Asia were relatively flat for both periods.
As of the date of this report, we expect gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 to be relatively consistent with the gross margin reported in the third quarter of 2019.
The Company recorded foreign currency losses of $1,295,000 and $1,403,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods in 2019, respectively, compared to $379,000 and $708,000 for the same periods in 2018. Foreign currency gains and losses result primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany balances that are reported in one currency and collected in another. A higher level of foreign currency losses was recorded in the third quarter of 2019 from the revaluation of intercompany payables denominated in U.S. Dollars on the company's China entity.
Investment income increased by $1,177,000, or 30%, for the three-month period and $4,506,000, or 42%, for the nine-month period. The increase was due to higher yields on the Company's portfolio of debt securities, and to a lesser extent additional funds available for investment.
The Company recorded other income of $456,000 and $1,239,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods in 2019, respectively, compared to other expense of $129,000 and $98,000 for the same periods in 2018. Other income (expense) includes fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions. A higher level of fair value adjustments to income was recorded in 2019 related to the Company's GVi acquisition resulting from a lower level of revenue in the Americas' automotive industry. 
The Company’s effective tax rate was 12% of pre-tax income for the three-month and nine-month periods in 2019, respectively, compared to 1% and 6% for the same periods in 2018.
The effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $569,000 and $4,547,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods in 2019, respectively, and $2,811,000 and $8,400,000 for the same periods in 2018 primarily from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises. The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods. 
In addition, the effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $1,327,000 for the three-month period and $1,330,000 for the nine-month period in 2019, respectively, consisting primarily of the expiration of the statutes of limitations for certain reserves for income tax uncertainties.
Excluding the impact of these discrete tax events, the Company’s effective tax rate was 16% of pre-tax income for all periods presented. 
The European Union has initiated a series of tax reform legislation over the past few years regarding hybrid tax structures. The Company plans to make changes to its tax structure in the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of this legislation. Management is currently evaluating the financial impact of these changes and expects to record a discrete tax benefit of between $100 million and $125 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Management also expects its current effective tax rate excluding discrete items of 16% to increase slightly in future years as a result of this change.

The Company may repurchase shares under this program in future periods, up to the remaining balance of $129,688,000, depending on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the impact of dilution from employee stock options, stock price, share availability, and cash requirements.

As of September 29, 2019, the Company had $918,414,000 in cash and investments. In addition, the Company has no long-term debt and does not anticipate needing debt financing in the near future. We believe that our strong cash position has put us in a relatively good position with respect to our longer-term liquidity needs.
