In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.
Cognex machine vision is primarily used to automate manufacturing and distribution processes in a variety of industries where the technology is widely recognized as an important component of automated production and quality assurance.
Virtually every manufacturer can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, Cognex products are used by a broad base of customers across a variety of industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices.

Revenue for the third quarter of 2019 totaled $183,325,000, representing a decrease of 21% from the third quarter of 2018 driven by significantly lower revenue in the consumer electronics industry.
Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2019 decreased by 3% over the third quarter of 2018 due principally to lower expenses related to incentive compensation plans.
Constant-currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.
We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant-currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes.
Results on a constant-currency basis are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Revenue decreased by $48,896,000, or 21%, for the three-month period and decreased by $57,196,000, or 9%, for the nine-month period.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on revenue for either period presented.
Sales to customers based in Europe decreased by 46% for the three-month period and 26% for the nine-month period driven by lower sales in the consumer electronics industry, and to a lessor extent, the automotive industry.
The decline would have been larger in Greater China, and less extreme in Europe, if not for procurement changes made by certain consumer electronics customers, shifting their purchases to China from Europe.
As of the date of this report, we expect revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 to be lower than both the third quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018.
The sequential decrease is anticipated to come primarily from lower sales in the consumer electronics industry due to the seasonal timing of this business, while the decrease from the prior year is anticipated to come from a broad base of customers in a variety of industries, particularly in China and Europe.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 74% for both the three-month and nine-month periods in 2019 compared to 75% for the same periods in 2018.
As of the date of this report, we expect gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 to be relatively consistent with the gross margin reported in the third quarter of 2019.
Foreign currency gains and losses result primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany balances that are reported in one currency and collected in another.
A higher level of foreign currency losses was recorded in the third quarter of 2019 from the revaluation of intercompany payables denominated in U.S.
Dollars on the company's China entity.
Investment income increased by $1,177,000, or 30%, for the three-month period and $4,506,000, or 42%, for the nine-month period.
The increase was due to higher yields on the Company's portfolio of debt securities, and to a lesser extent additional funds available for investment.
The Company recorded other income of $456,000 and $1,239,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods in 2019, respectively, compared to other expense of $129,000 and $98,000 for the same periods in 2018.
Other income (expense) includes fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions.
A higher level of fair value adjustments to income was recorded in 2019 related to the Company's GVi acquisition resulting from a lower level of revenue in the Americas' automotive industry.
The Company’s effective tax rate was 12% of pre-tax income for the three-month and nine-month periods in 2019, respectively, compared to 1% and 6% for the same periods in 2018.
The effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $569,000 and $4,547,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods in 2019, respectively, and $2,811,000 and $8,400,000 for the same periods in 2018 primarily from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises.
The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods.
In addition, the effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $1,327,000 for the three-month period and $1,330,000 for the nine-month period in 2019, respectively, consisting primarily of the expiration of the statutes of limitations for certain reserves for income tax uncertainties.

Management also expects its current effective tax rate excluding discrete items of 16% to increase slightly in future years as a result of this change.

The Company may repurchase shares under this program in future periods, up to the remaining balance of $129,688,000, depending on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the impact of dilution from employee stock options, stock price, share availability, and cash requirements.
