We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
Disclosure controls also are designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
We monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis our disclosure controls and procedures in order to improve their overall effectiveness.
In the course of these evaluations, we modify and refine our internal processes and controls as conditions warrant.
Based on this evaluation the Companyâ€™s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
The exhibits filed herewith or incorporated by reference herein are listed in the Exhibit Index attached hereto.
