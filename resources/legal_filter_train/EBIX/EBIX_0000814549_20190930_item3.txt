The Company's exposure to interest rate risk relates to its interest expense on outstanding debt obligations and to its interest income on existing cash balances. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had $721.0 million of outstanding debt obligations, which consisted of a $279.9 million term loan, a $438.0 million balance on our commercial banking revolving line of credit, and a $1.8 million note due to IHC by the EbixHealth JV, and $1.3 million of previously existing debt pertaining to Weizmann. The Company's revolving line of credit carries a leverage-based LIBOR related interest rate, and stood at 4.81% at September 30, 2019. The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to this line of credit in regards to the potential increase in interest expense arising from adverse changes in interest rates. This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 30 basis point increase in the LIBOR rate. Such an adverse change in the LIBOR rate would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $4.5 million and $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company's average cash balances and short term investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $129.1 million and its existing cash balances as of September 30, 2019 were $124.2 million. The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to these cash balances in regards to the potential loss of interest income arising from adverse changes in interest rates. This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 20 basis point decrease in interest rates earned on deposited funds. Such an adverse change in these interest rates would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $227 thousand and $342 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company has significant outstanding trade accounts receivable with certain Indian government sponsored companies in connection with one of its joint ventures. See Note 12 for additional information.
