For additional information about these policies, see Note 1 of the Condensed Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.
There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies related to revenue recognition as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (our “ 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K”).
Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent the fair value of acquired contractual customer relationships for which future cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely.
In accordance with the relevant FASB accounting guidance, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely have reduced the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
We determine the fair value of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows.
If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no further testing is required.
However, if a reporting unit's fair value were to be less than its carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied value.
We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value.
We perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and testing as of September 30th of each year.
During the year ended December 31, 2018 we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances.
Valuation allowances, if any, are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management considers more likely than not to be realized.

Gains and losses resulting from translation adjustments are included as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Board directed that the repurchases be funded with available cash balances and cash generated by the Company's operating activities.
