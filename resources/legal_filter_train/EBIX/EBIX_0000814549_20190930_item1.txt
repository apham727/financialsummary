Ebix, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Description of Business— Ebix, Inc., and its subsidiaries, (“Ebix” or the “Company”) is a leading international supplier of on-demand infrastructure exchanges to the insurance, financial, and healthcare industries.
In the insurance sector, the Company’s main focus is to develop and deploy a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance exchanges on an on-demand basis, while also providing software-as-a-service ("SaaS") enterprise solutions in the area of customer relationship management ("CRM"), front-end and back-end systems, and outsourced administrative and risk compliance.
The Company's products feature fully customizable and scalable on-demand software designed to streamline the way insurance professionals manage distribution, marketing, sales, customer service, and accounting activities.
With a "Phygital” strategy that combines physical distribution outlets in many Association of Southwest Asian Nations ("ASEAN") countries to an Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company’s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio of services encompasses dominance in the areas of domestic and international money remittance, foreign exchange ("Forex"), travel, pre-paid gift cards, utility payments, lending, and wealth management in India and other Asian markets.
The Company has its headquarters in Johns Creek, Georgia and also conducts operating activities in Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and United Arab Emirates.
Restricted Cash - The carrying value of our restricted cash in current assets was $18.2 million and $8.3 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
The September 30, 2019 balance consists of upfront cash consideration and possible future contingent earn-out payments held in an escrow account in connection with a 2016 business acquisition.
The Company also holds fixed deposits pledged with banks for issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit related to its India operations.
Advertising—Advertising costs amounted to $2.0 million and $2.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $7.6 million and $6.2 million in the nine months ended 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•Level 2 Inputs - Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
 A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
•Short-term investments (commercial bank certificates of deposits and mutual funds), for which the fair values are measured as a Level 1 instrument.
•Contingent accrued earn-out business acquisition consideration liabilities for which fair values are measured as Level 3 instruments.
These contingent consideration liabilities were recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are re-measured quarterly based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary.
As the fair value measure is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, they are categorized as Level 3.
and determination of the fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities for purchased businesses.
Revenue Recognition—The Company derives its revenues primarily from software subscription and transaction fees, software license fees, financial transaction fees, risk compliance solution services fees, and professional service fees including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems and applications.
EbixCash revenues are primarily derived from consideration paid by customers to transfer or exchange money.
EbixCash also offers several other services, primarily including payment services and ticketing and travel services for which revenue is impacted by varying factors.
EbixCash acts as the principal in transactions and reports revenue on a gross basis, as EbixCash controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is primarily responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.
In the majority of EbixCash’s foreign exchange and payment services, EbixCash makes payments to the recipient to satisfy its performance obligation to the customer, and therefore, EbixCash recognizes revenue on foreign exchange and payment services when this performance obligation has been fulfilled.
For all transactions, EbixCash’s customers agree to EbixCash’s terms and conditions, either at the time of initiating a transaction (where the consumer is determined to be the customer for revenue recognition purposes) or upon signing a contract with EbixCash to provide services on the biller’s behalf (where the biller is determined to be the customer for revenue recognition purposes).
As with consumer money transfers, customers engage EbixCash to perform one integrated service—collect money from the consumer and process the bill payment transaction, thereby providing the billers real-time or near real-time information regarding their customers’ payments and simplifying the billers’ collection efforts.
EbixCash’s revenues from bill payment services are generated from contracts to process transactions at any time during the duration of the contract.
The transaction price on bill payment services is contractual and determinable.
Certain biller agreements may include per-transaction or fixed periodic rebates, which EbixCash records as a reduction to revenue.
EbixCash Travel revenue is for a single performance obligation and is recognized at a point in time.
EbixCash’s Travel revenue is also derived from ticket sales, wherein the commissions payable to EbixCash Travel, along with any transaction fees paid by travel providers and travel exchanges, is recognized as revenue after completion of the service.
The transaction price on such services is agreed upon at the time of the purchase.
For MICE revenues, EbixCash Travel acts as the principal in transactions, and accordingly reports revenue on a gross basis.
EbixCash Travel controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.
EbixCash resells gift cards to consumers that can be later redeemed at various merchants.
Gift cards are recorded as inventory until sold to the consumer.
Contracts generally do not contain a right of return or refund provisions.
The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price.
Determining the stand-alone selling price may require significant judgement.
The stand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity has sold or would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer.
Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term.
Our subscription contracts are generally for an initial three-year period with subsequent one-year automatic renewals.
Transaction revenue is comprised of fees applied to the volume of transactions that are processed through our SaaS platforms.
These are typically based on a per-transaction rate and are invoiced for the same period in which the transactions were processed and as the performance obligation is satisfied.
The amount invoiced generally equals the value provided to the customer, and revenue is typically recognized when invoiced using the as-invoiced practical expedient.
Professional service revenue primarily consists of fees for setup, customization, training, or consulting.
Revenues for time and materials are recognized as such services are rendered while fixed fee revenues are recognized based on the input method driven by the expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date.
RCS revenues consist of two revenue streams—Certificates of Insurance (COI) and Consulting Services.
COI revenues are derived from consideration paid by customers for the creation and tracking of certificates of insurance.
These are transactional-based revenues.
Revenue is derived from transaction fees for each certificate issued or tracked.
The Company provides consulting services to clients around the world for project management and development.
Consulting services fees are generally on a time and materials basis or a fixed fee.
Revenues for time and materials are recognized as the services are rendered while fixed fee revenues are recognized based on the input method driven by the expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date.
The revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 shown below have been adjusted to reflect this change.
The Company’s capitalized costs are primarily derived from the fulfillment of SaaS related setup and customizations from which the customer receives benefit through continued access to and use of the SaaS product platforms.
In accordance with the guidance in ASC 340-40-25-5, we capitalize the costs directly related to the setup and development of these customizations which satisfy the Company’s performance obligation with respect to access to the Company’s underlying product platforms.
The capitalized costs primarily consist of the salaries of the developers directly involved in fulfilling the project and are solely based on the time spent on that project.
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had $749 thousand and $862 thousand, respectively, of contract costs in “Other current assets” and $1.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in “Other Assets” on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company records contract liabilities when it receives payments or invoices in advance of the performance of services.
This portion is recognized as the related performance obligation is fulfilled (generally less than one year).
Part of our performance obligation for these contracts consists of the requirement to provide our customers with continued access to, and use of, our SaaS platforms and associated customizations.
Without continued access to the SaaS platform, the customizations have no separate benefit to the customer.
Our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits as we provide access over time.
The remaining portion of the contract liabilities balance consists primarily of customer-specific customizations that are not distinct from related performance obligations that transfer over time.
This portion is recognized over the expected useful life of the customizations.
Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts—Reported accounts receivable include $165.4 million of trade receivables stated at invoice billed amounts and $35.3 million of contract assets (net of the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in the amount of $21.0 million).
The Company records a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings.
These contract assets are primarily related to project based revenue where we recognize revenue using the input method calculated using expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date.
Approximately $4.4 million and $10.2 million, respectively, of contract liabilities (deferred revenue) is uncollected and included in billed accounts receivable at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
The Company recognized bad debt expense in the amount of $11.9 million and $10.6 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and $524 thousand and $2.6 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
In the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a $12.1 million bad debt reserve as a precautionary measure, against the receivables due from a public sector entity, BSNL, in India.
Payment of these receivables has been delayed due to liquidity issues at BSNL.
The Government of India has recently approved funding to BSNL and the Company expects the accounts to be collectible once the Government funding reaches BSNL.
In accordance with the relevant FASB accounting guidance, goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurred or circumstances change that would indicate that fair value of a reporting unit decreased below its carrying value.
The aforementioned quantitative testing process involves comparing the reporting unit carrying values to their respective fair values; we determine fair value of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows.
If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no further testing is required.
However, if a reporting unit’s fair value were to be less than its carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeded its implied value.
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018 are reflected in the following table.
See Note 9 "Capitalized Software Development Costs" for further details.
Amortization expense recognized in connection with acquired intangible assets was $2.7 million and $7.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and $1.6 million and $5.2 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
The functional currency of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates.
Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses that are derived from transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency are included in the determination of net income.
ASU 2018-18 clarifies the interaction between the guidance for certain collaborative arrangements and the Revenue Recognition financial accounting and reporting standard.
A collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement under which two or more parties actively participate in a joint operating activity and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the activity’s commercial success.
The ASU provides guidance on how to assess whether certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for within the revenue recognition standard.
The ASU also provides comparability in the presentation of revenue for certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants.
It accomplishes this by allowing organizations to only present units of account in collaborative arrangements that are within the scope of the revenue recognition standard together with revenue accounted for under the revenue recognition standard.
The parts of the collaborative arrangement that are not in the scope of the revenue recognition standard should be presented separately from revenue accounted for under the revenue recognition standard.
The amendments in ASU No.
2018-18 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
•Add a disclosure for the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurement.
The Company has yet to assess the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on Ebix's consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting for share-based payments to non-employees.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the FASB eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities).
Instead, under the amendments in this ASU, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
A public business entity filer should adopt the amendments in this ASU for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.

This new accounting guidance is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions.
The ASU requires organizations that lease assets referred to as “Lessees” to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
An organization is to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
Under the new guidance, a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months.
Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.
However, unlike former GAAP, which requires only financing leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new ASU requires both types of leases (i.e., operating and financing) to be recognized on the balance sheet.
The financing lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases were accounted for under the previous guidance.
For operating leases, there is now the recognition of a lease liability and a lease asset for all such leases greater than one year in term.
