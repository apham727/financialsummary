Ebix, Inc. and Subsidiaries
The Company is continuing to evaluate the classification of the 2017 and 2018 acquisitions that collectively make up the EbixCash Financial Exchanges, refer to Part I, Item I Business in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Restricted Cash- As part of the ItzCash Card Limited ("ItzCash") acquisition, $4.0 million of the possible future contingent earn-out payments is being held in escrow accounts for the twelve month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual gross revenue threshold.
This threshold has been achieved and will be paid out in the subsequent quarter.
Additionally, as part of the Wdev Solucoes em Technologia SA ("Wdev") acquisition, upfront cash consideration is being held in an escrow account for the thirty-eight month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual net revenue threshold, which if not achieved will result in said funds being returned to Ebix.
As of June 30, 2018 there is $2.6 million included in other long-term assets of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Under legacy US GAAP 340-20, direct response advertising was eligible for capitalization if certain conditions were met.
During the first six months of 2017 reported sales and marketing expenses included $2.0 million of amortization of certain direct-response advertising costs associated with our medical education services, which have been capitalized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 340.
Effective January 1, 2018 Subtopic 340-40 replaced that guidance to require the costs of direct-response advertising to be expensed as they are incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
The Company was required to recognize a cumulative effective change to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption of the standard.
The Company recorded a one-time $1.9 million adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2018 and is expensing all future costs from this date forward.
Under the new guidance Subtopic 340-40, the Company's expense decreased by $497 thousand during the first six months of 2018 from what would have been recorded under legacy US GAAP 340-20.
•Level 2 Inputs - Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
 A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
•Short-term investments (commercial bank certificates of deposits and mutual funds), for which the fair values are measured as a Level 1 instrument.
•Contingent accrued earn-out business acquisition consideration liabilities for which fair values are measured as Level 3 instruments.
These contingent consideration liabilities were recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are re-measured quarterly based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary.
As the fair value measure is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, they are categorized as Level 3.
The Company applies these terms in its calculation and determination of the fair value of contingent earn out liabilities for purchased businesses as part of the related valuation and purchase price allocation exercise for the corresponding acquired assets and liabilities.
Revenue Recognition—In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("Topic 606").
Topic 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net), which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and in April 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which amends the guidance in those areas in the new revenue recognition standard.
The Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription and transaction fees pertaining to services delivered over our exchanges or from our application service provider ("ASP") platforms, fees for risk compliance solution services, and fees for software development projects including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems and applications.
For contracts that contain multiple deliverables, we analyze the revenue arrangements in accordance with the relevant technical accounting guidance, which provides criteria governing how to determine whether goods or services that are delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be considered as separate performance obligations for the purpose of revenue recognition.
These types of arrangements include obligations pertaining to software licenses, system set-up, and professional services associated with product customization or modification.
Delivery of the various contractual obligations typically occurs over periods of less than eighteen months.
These arrangements generally do not have refund provisions or have very limited refund terms.
Software development arrangements involving significant customization, modification or production are accounted for in accordance with the appropriate technical accounting guidance issued by FASB using the percentage-of-completion method.
The Company recognizes revenue using periodic reported actual hours worked as a percentage of total expected hours required to complete the project arrangement and applies the percentage to the total arrangement fee.
The transaction-based fees are primarily based on a percentage of payment value processed for solutions such as retail and corporate payments, international and domestic money transfers, foreign exchange, travel related transactions and general purpose reloadable cards.
Transaction-based fees are recognized at the completion of the transaction.
The Company adopted Topic 606 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method and applying the new standard to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.
Therefore, the comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
The adoption resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $11.6 million for the cumulative effect of applying the Topic 606.
During the first quarter of 2018 the company recorded its meetings, incentives, conference, events (“M.I.C.E.“) revenue on a net basis for its Via.com division.
The net amount reported in operating revenues was $256 thousand ($2.06 million gross revenue less associated costs of $1.8 million).
As a result the second quarter’s revenues included the gross presentation of the first quarter amounts.
The Company capitalizes certain costs in order to maintain the ability to obtain and fulfill new contracts and contract renewals.
Under our treatment prior to implementing Topic 606, these costs were expensed as incurred.
The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments or invoices in advance of the performance of services.
This portion is recognized as the related performance obligation is fulfilled (generally less than one year).
The remaining portion of the deferred revenue balance consists primarily of customer-specific customizations that are not distinct from related performance obligations that transfer over time.
This portion is recognized over the expected useful life of the customizations.
The adoption of Topic 606 resulted in an increase to deferred revenue, which in turn generated an additional deferred tax asset that increased the Company’s net deferred tax asset position.
Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts—Reported accounts receivable include $107.0 million of trade receivables stated at invoice billed amounts and $41.3 million of unbilled receivables (net of the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in the amount of $6.1 million).
The unbilled receivables pertain to certain projects for which the timing of billing is tied to contractual milestones.
The Company adheres to such contractually stated performance milestones and accordingly issues invoices to customers as per contract billing schedules.
Approximately $5.8 million of deferred revenue is included in billed accounts receivable at June 30, 2018.
The Company recognized and recorded bad debt expense in the amount of $1.1 million and $2.1 million for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and $316 thousand and $723 thousand for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, respectively.
Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance account when the Company has exhausted all reasonable collection efforts.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets—Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent the fair value of certain acquired contractual customer relationships for which future cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely.
In accordance with the relevant FASB accounting guidance, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely have reduced the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
The aforementioned two-step quantitative testing process involves comparing the reporting unit carrying values to their respective fair values; we determine fair value of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows.
If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no further testing is required.
However, if a reporting unit's fair value were to be less than its carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied value.
We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value.
The fair value of three of these reporting units were found to be greater than their carrying value and,therefore, step-two of the quantitative testing process described above became unnecessary because no impairment was indicated.
In specific regards to the RCS reporting unit, its assessed fair value was $158.0 million which was $42.4 million or 36.7% in excess of its $115.6 million carrying value.
Key assumptions used in the fair value determination were annual revenue growth of 7.5% to 12.5% and discount rate of 16%.
During the year ended December 31, 2017 we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances.
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017 are reflected in the following table.
Amortization expense recognized in connection with acquired intangible assets was $1.7 million and $3.6 million for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and $1.8 million and $3.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.
The functional currency of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates.
Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses that are derived from transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency are included in the determination of net income.
In June 2018 the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting for share-based payments to nonemployees.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year.
The Company has yet to assess the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on Ebix's consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment".
To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the FASB eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities).
Instead, under the amendments in this ASU, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
A public business entity filer should adopt the amendments in this ASU for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
The Company has yet to assess the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on Ebix's consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted.
In November 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flow (Topic 230) Restricted Cash amends ASC 230 to add or clarify guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows.
The amendments in this ASU require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company held $4.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in "Restricted cash" and $2.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in "Other long-term assets" of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
The amendments eliminate the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory.
The amendments are effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods.
The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2018 with no material impact to its consolidated financial statements.
This new accounting guidance is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions.
The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment.
The ASU will require organizations that lease assets referred to as “Lessees” to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
An organization is to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months.
Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.
However, unlike current GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the new ASU will require both types of leases (i.e., operating and capital) to be recognized on the balance sheet.
The FASB lessee accounting model will continue to account for both types of leases.
The capital lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases are accounted for under existing GAAP.
For operating leases there will have to be the recognition of a lease liability and a lease asset for all such leases greater than one year in term.
See Note 5 for the Company’s current lease commitments.
The Company is evaluating the impact that this new leasing ASU will have on its financial statements.
 The Company seeks to execute accretive business acquisitions (which primarily targets businesses that are complementary to Ebix's existing products and services), in combination with organic growth initiatives, as part of its comprehensive business growth and expansion strategy.

In the geographical information table above the significant changes to long-lived assets from June 30, 2017 to June 30, 2018 were comprised of an increase in the United States of $4.4 million primarily due to capitalized continuing medical education product costs and the continued build out of our global corporate headquarters campus in Johns Creek, Georgia.
A decrease occurred in Latin America of $4.1 million primarily due to a 14.8% weakening of the Brazilian Real versus the U.S. Dollar which caused a $1.2 million decrease in the translation of long-lived assets plus continued amortization of intangible assets.

The Europe increase of $3.3 million is primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets primarily due to the release of valuation allowances of operating loss carryforwards, partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets and capitalized software development costs.
Effective January 2, 2018 Paul Merchants acquired a 10% equity interest in Ebix’s combined international remittance business in India (comprised of YouFirst, Wall Street , Paul Merchants, and Transcorp) for cash consideration of $5.0 million.

$4.0 million of the possible future contingent earn-out payments is being held in escrow accounts for the twelve month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves
the minimum specified annual gross revenue threshold, which if not achieved will result in said funds being returned to Ebix.
The valuation and purchase price allocation for the ItzCash acquisition remains preliminary.
Effective February 7, 2016 Ebix and Vayam Technologies Ltd ("Vayam") formed a joint venture named Ebix Vayam Limited JV.
