However, the Company has operations in Australia, India (specifically EbixCash), New Zealand, Great Britain, Canada, Brazil, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, and United Arab Emirates where we conduct transactions in the local currencies of each of these locations.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation account, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholdersâ€™ equity, were unrealized gains (losses) of $(61.8) million and $3.9 million, respectively.
Such an adverse change in currency exchange rates would have resulted in reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $11.1 million and $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Company's exposure to interest rate risk relates to its interest expense on outstanding debt obligations and to its interest income on existing cash balances.
As of September 30, 2018 the Company had $645.2 million of outstanding debt obligations which consisted of a $243.8 million term loan, a $399.7 million balance on our commercial banking revolving line of credit, and a $1.8 million note due to IHC by the EbixHealth JV.
The Company's revolving line of credit bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%, and stood at 4.63% at September 30, 2018.
The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to this line of credit in regards to the potential increase in interest expense arising from adverse changes in interest rates.
This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 30 basis point increase in the LIBOR rate.
Such an adverse change in the LIBOR rate would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $2.5 million and $915 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to these cash balances in regards to the potential loss of interest income arising from adverse changes in interest rates.
This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 20 basis point interest rates earned on deposited funds.
Such an adverse change in these interest rates would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $342 thousand and $323 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
There were no other material changes to our market risk exposure during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
