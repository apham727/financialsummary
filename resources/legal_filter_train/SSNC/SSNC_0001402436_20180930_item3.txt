We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
We have generally invested our available cash in short-term, highly liquid financial instruments, having initial maturities of three months or less.
When necessary, we have borrowed to fund acquisitions.
We derive service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which we are the agent for clients.
The balances maintained in the bank accounts will fluctuate.
We estimate that a 100 basis point change in the interest earnings rate would equal approximately $8.9 million of net income on an annual basis.
The effect of changes in interest rates attributable to earnings derived from cash balances we hold for clients is partially offset by changes in interest rates on our variable debt.
At September 30, 2018, we had total debt of $6.8 billion, which nearly all is variable interest rate debt.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, approximately 28% of our revenues were from clients located outside the United States.
While revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies, some subsidiaries do enter into certain transactions in currencies that are different from their local currency.
These transactions consist primarily of cross-currency intercompany balances and trade receivables and payables.
As a result of these transactions, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which we report in other income (expense).
These outstanding amounts were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
We do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes.
We have entered into foreign currency cash flow and economic hedging programs to mitigate the impact of movements in foreign currency (principally Thai baht and Indian rupee) on our operations.
The total notional value of our foreign currency derivatives was $14.5 million at September 30, 2018.
The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $1.2 million at September 30, 2018.
We estimate a 10% change in exchange rates on these contracts would result in a $1.0 million change to net income.
