We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
We have invested our available cash in short-term, highly liquid financial instruments, having initial maturities of three months or less.
When necessary, we have borrowed to fund acquisitions.
As of March 31, 2018, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately $14.3 million per year.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, approximately 28% of our revenues were from clients located outside the United States.
A portion of the revenues from clients located outside the United States is denominated in foreign currencies, the majority being the Canadian dollar.
While revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies, some subsidiaries do enter into certain transactions in currencies that are different from their local currency.
These transactions consist primarily of cross-currency intercompany balances and trade receivables and payables.
As a result of these transactions, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which we report in other income (expense).
These outstanding amounts were not material for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
We do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes.
