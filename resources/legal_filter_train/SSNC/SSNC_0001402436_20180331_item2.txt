Acquisition of DST Systems, Inc.
On April 16, 2018, the Company purchased all of the outstanding stock of DST Systems, Inc. (“DST”) for approximately $5.0 billion in cash, plus the costs, fees, expenses and debt assumed in connection with the transaction.
A portion of these proceeds was used to repay the Company’s Senior Notes and the remaining amounts outstanding under the Company’s existing credit facility.
In addition, the amended and restated senior secured credit facility includes an undrawn revolving credit facility of $250.0 million.
DST is a global provider of specialized technology, strategic advisory and business operations outsourcing to the financial services and healthcare industries.
The relevant business combination disclosures will be included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements once preliminary accounting has been completed.

Our revenues increased $14.2 million or 3.5%.
Revenues increased primarily due to increased demand for our software-enabled services.
Our acquisitions, which included CommonWealth Fund Services Ltd. (“CommonWealth”) in the fourth quarter of 2017, contributed $1.8 million in revenues and the favorable impact from foreign currency translation added $3.3 million, which resulted primarily from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the British Pound, the Euro and the Canadian dollar.

Offsetting the overall decrease in license, maintenance and related revenues was an increase of $1.5 million due to the favorable impact from foreign currency translation.

Interest expense, net.
We had net interest expense of $25.4 million in 2018 compared to $29.0 million in 2017.
The decrease in interest expense for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to a lower average debt balance as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.
These facilities are discussed further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”.
We had other income, net of $0.4 million and other expense, net of less than $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction losses in both periods.
Loss on extinguishment of debt.
We recorded a $2.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the three months ended March 31, 2017 in connection with the amendment of our senior secured credit facility.
The loss on early extinguishment of debt includes the write-off of a portion of the unamortized capitalized financing fees related to the senior secured credit facility for amounts accounted for as a debt extinguishment, as well as the new financing fees related to the senior secured credit facility for amounts accounted for as a debt modification.
The consolidated expected effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 is forecasted to be between 23% and 25%.
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
We did not make any significant adjustments to these estimates for the quarter ending March 31, 2018.
Our principal cash requirements are to finance the costs of our operations pending the billing and collection of client receivables, to fund payments with respect to our indebtedness, to invest in research and development, to acquire complementary businesses or assets and to pay dividends on our common stock.
We expect our cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and cash available under the Amended Senior Secured Credit Agreement to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements and capital spending for at least the next twelve months.
In April 2018, we purchased all of the outstanding stock of DST for approximately $5.0 billion in cash, plus the costs, fees, expenses and debt assumed in connection with the transaction.
We funded the acquisition and refinancing of existing debt with $7.4 billion of debt financing (of which approximately $524.5 million was rolled over from our existing credit facility) and a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of approximately $1.4 billion of our common stock.
In 2018, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per share of common stock on March 15, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2018, totaling $14.5 million.
In 2017, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.0625 per share of common stock on March 15, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2017, totaling $12.7 million.
Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at March 31, 2018 were $74.6 million, an increase of $10.0 million from $64.6 million at December 31, 2017.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $69.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from net income of $51.3 million adjusted for non-cash items of $64.3 million, partially offset by changes in our working capital accounts (excluding the effect of acquisitions) totaling $45.7 million.
The decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment of annual employee bonuses in the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in days’ sales outstanding related to receivables for annual maintenance invoices that are typically billed in the first quarter of each year.
Investing activities used net cash of $11.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily related to $7.2 million in capital expenditures and $3.9 million in capitalized software development costs as well as cash paid of $0.2 million related to purchase price adjustments for prior acquisitions.

The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash is primarily due to net repayments of debt, payments of annual employee cash incentive, payment of dividends, capital expenditures and payment of withholding taxes related to equity award net share settlement.
These decreases were partially offset by cash provided by operations and proceeds from stock option exercises.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $57.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

The decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment of annual employee bonuses in the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in days’ sales outstanding related to receivables within recently acquired businesses.
The increase in deferred revenues was primarily due to the collection of annual maintenance fees.
The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments.
Investing activities used net cash of $7.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily related to $6.0 million in capital expenditures and $3.3 million in capitalized software costs partially offset by cash received of $1.8 million related to purchase price adjustments for prior acquisitions.

We have made a permanent reinvestment determination in certain non-U.S. operations that have historically generated positive operating cash flows.
At March 31, 2018, we held approximately $51.8 million in cash that was available to our foreign borrowers under our senior secured credit facility and will be used to facilitate debt servicing of those entities.
On March 2, 2017, we entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to our Credit Agreement (“Amended Senior Secured Credit Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Amendment, the highest (non-default) interest rate margin applicable to Term Loan A was reduced from LIBOR plus 2.75% to LIBOR plus 1.75%, and the highest (non-default) interest rate margin applicable to Term Loan B was reduced from LIBOR plus 3.25% to LIBOR plus 2.25%.
No changes were made to the financial covenants, outstanding principal amounts or the scheduled amortization.
The Amendment was evaluated in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 470-50, Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments, for modification and extinguishment accounting.
We accounted for the debt re-pricing as a debt modification with respect to amounts that remained obligations of the same lender in the syndicate with minor changes in cash flows and as a debt extinguishment with respect to amounts that were obligations of lenders that exited the syndicate or remained in the syndicate but experienced a change in cash flows of greater than 10%.
The Company recorded a $2.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the three months ended March 31, 2017 in connection with the Amendment.
The loss on early extinguishment of debt includes the write-off of a portion of the unamortized capitalized financing fees related to the senior secured credit facility for amounts accounted for as a debt extinguishment, as well as new financing fees related to the Amendment for amounts accounted for as a debt modification.
Under the New Credit Agreement, we are required to make scheduled quarterly payments of 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans, with the balance due and payable on the seventh anniversary of its incurrence.
The obligations of the U.S. loan parties under the New Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of such persons (subject to customary exceptions and limitations), including a pledge of all of the capital stock of substantially all of the U.S. wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries of such persons (with customary exceptions and limitations) and 65% of the capital stock of certain foreign restricted subsidiaries of such persons (with customary exceptions and limitations).
All obligations of the non-U.S. loan parties under the New Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of Holdings’ and the other guarantors’ assets (subject to customary exceptions and limitations), including a pledge of all of the capital stock of substantially all of Holdings’ wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries (with customary exceptions and limitations).
of loans and acquisitions), merge, liquidate or dissolve, sell property and assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries, pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock, alter the business we conduct, amend, prepay, redeem or purchase subordinated debt, or engage in transactions with our affiliates.
In addition, the New Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a consolidated net secured leverage ratio.
In addition, under the New Credit Agreement, certain defaults under agreements governing other material indebtedness could result in an event of default under the New Credit Agreement, in which case the lenders could elect to accelerate payments under the New Credit Agreement and terminate any commitments they have to provide future borrowings.
On July 8, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Advent, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023.
On April 16, 2018, in connection with our acquisition of DST, we redeemed in full all of the outstanding Senior Notes.
Any event of default under the Amended Senior Secured Credit Agreement that led to an acceleration of those amounts due would also have resulted in a default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes.
We are required to satisfy and maintain a specified financial ratio under the New Credit Agreement as well.
Any breach of these covenants could result in an event of default under the New Credit Agreement.
Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the New Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the New Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.
Consolidated EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used in key financial covenants contained in the Amended Senior Secured Credit Agreement and now the New Credit Agreement, which is the material facility supporting our capital structure and providing liquidity to our business.
Consolidated EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the Amended Senior Secured Credit Agreement.
We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Consolidated EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with the specified financial ratio and other financial condition tests contained in the New Credit Agreement.
Additionally, under the New Credit Agreement, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on Consolidated EBITDA.
Consolidated EBITDA does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs.
Further, the New Credit Agreement requires that Consolidated EBITDA be calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters.
Further, it may not be comparable to the measure for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year.
Consolidated EBITDA excludes expenses and income that are permitted to be excluded per the terms of our Amended Senior Secured Credit Agreement, but which others may believe are normal expenses for the operation of a business.
The following is a reconciliation of net income to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in our New Credit Agreement.
Acquired EBITDA reflects the EBITDA impact of significant businesses that were acquired during the period as if the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the period, as well as cost savings enacted in connection with acquisitions.
Purchase accounting adjustments include (a) an adjustment to increase revenues by the amount that would have been recognized if deferred revenue were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisitions, (b) an adjustment to increase personnel and commissions expense by the amount that would have been recognized if prepaid commissions and deferred personnel costs were not adjusted to fair value at the date of the acquisitions and (c) an adjustment to increase rent expense by the amount that would have been recognized if lease obligations were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisitions.
Other includes expenses and income that are permitted to be excluded per the terms of our Amended Senior Secured Credit Agreement from Consolidated EBITDA, a financial measure used in calculating our covenant compliance.
In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”), 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
ASU 2016-15 addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 230, Statement of Cash flow, and other Topics.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
ASC 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605 and 985 and requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
See Note 2 in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
ASU 2016-13 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
This ASU would require lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date; (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
Lessor accounting is largely unchanged under the amendments of this ASU.
Additional disclosures will be required to allow the user to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing activities.
