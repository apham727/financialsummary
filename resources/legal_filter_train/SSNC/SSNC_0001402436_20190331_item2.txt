Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
Our revenues increased $715.3 million, or 169.5%, primarily due to our acquisitions, which included DST Systems, Inc. (“DST”) and CACEIS North America (“CACEIS”) in the second quarter of 2018 and Eze Software Group, LLC (“Eze”) and Intralinks Holdings, Inc. (“Intralinks”) in the fourth quarter of 2018, which, combined, contributed $703.4 million in revenues.
Additionally, revenues increased due to increased demand for our software-enabled services.
Software-enabled services revenues increased $677.2 million, or 229.7%, primarily due to the acquisitions, which added revenues of $668.7 million, as well as from a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services and services for advisory and wealth managers.

Interest expense, net.
We had net interest expense of $101.6 million in 2019 compared to $25.3 million in 2018.
The increase in interest expense, net for 2019 as compared to 2018 relates primarily to increased borrowings in connection with our acquisitions of DST, Eze and Intralinks and, to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates.
These facilities are discussed further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”.
Other income, net.
We had other income, net of $3.5 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, other income, net included investment gains and dividend income of $8.0 million.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, other income, net consisted primarily of foreign currency transaction losses.
Loss on extinguishment of debt.
We recorded a $7.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the three months ended March 31, 2019 in connection with the repayment of a portion of our Term Loans with the proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Notes.
The loss on extinguishment of debt includes costs incurred by us which did not meet the criteria for capitalization.
These Senior Notes are discussed further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”.
Our principal cash requirements are to finance the costs of our operations pending the billing and collection of client receivables, to fund payments with respect to our indebtedness, to invest in research and development, to acquire complementary businesses or assets and to pay dividends on our common stock.
We expect our cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and cash available under our Credit Agreement to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements and capital spending for at least the next twelve months.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock totaling $25.2 million in the aggregate.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of common stock totaling $14.5 million in the aggregate.
Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents, including amounts held on behalf of clients, were $1,023.4 million at March 31, 2019, a decrease of $89.9 million from $1,113.3 million at December 31, 2018.
The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to a decrease in restricted cash associated with funds receivable and held on behalf of clients.
Client funds obligations represent our contractual obligations within the DST business to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us.
Our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client obligations are primarily sourced by funds held on behalf of clients.
We had $954.8 million of client funds obligations at March 31, 2019.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $137.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from net income of $80.8 million adjusted for non-cash items of $193.4 million, partially offset by changes in our working capital accounts (excluding the effect of acquisitions) totaling $136.8 million.
The decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment of annual employee bonuses in the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to a slight increase in days’ sales outstanding as well as the billing of receivables for annual maintenance invoices that are typically billed in the first quarter of each year.
The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments.
Investing activities used net cash of $16.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily related to $16.4 million in capitalized software development costs and $16.3 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $10.8 million, cash received of $3.2 million related to purchase price adjustments for prior acquisitions and the collection of other non-current receivables of $2.6 million.
These payments were partially offset by $2,140.0 million received from debt borrowings and proceeds of $45.1 million from stock option exercises.

The decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment of annual employee bonuses in the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in days’ sales outstanding related to receivables for annual maintenance invoices that are typically billed in the first quarter of each year.
Investing activities used net cash of $11.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily related to $7.2 million in capital expenditures and $3.9 million in capitalized software development costs as well as cash paid of $0.2 million related to purchase price adjustments for prior acquisitions.

We have made a permanent reinvestment determination in certain non-U.S. operations that have historically generated positive operating cash flows.
At March 31, 2019, we held approximately $82.5 million in cash that was available to our foreign borrowers under our senior secured credit facility and will be used to facilitate debt servicing of those entities.
The majority of the initial proceeds from the Initial Term Loans was used to fund the acquisition of DST, repay certain amounts outstanding under our then-existing credit agreement (“Prior Credit Agreement”), repay all of the outstanding principal amount of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (“Prior Senior Notes”) and repay acquired debt associated with DST.
On October 1, 2018, in connection with our acquisition of Eze, we entered into an amendment (the “Commitment Increase Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement.
Pursuant to the Incremental Term Loan Amendment, an additional $1.0 billion under the Term B-5 Loan was made available to us, the proceeds of which were used to finance, in part, the Intralinks acquisition.
Amounts drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility initially bear interest at either LIBOR plus 2.25% or at the base rate plus 1.25%, subject to a step-down at any time our consolidated net secured leverage ratio is less than 4.75 times, to 2.0% in the case of the LIBOR margin and 1.0% in the case of the base rate margin.
The Term B-3 Loan, Term B-4 Loan and Term B-5 Loan initially bear interest at either LIBOR plus 2.50% or at the base rate plus 1.50%, and are subject to a step-down at any time our consolidated net secured leverage ratio is less than 4.75 times, to 2.25% in the case of the LIBOR margin and 1.25% in the case of the base rate margin.
There was no principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan B-2.
As of March 31, 2019, there was $20.0 million in principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The obligations of the U.S. loan parties under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of such persons (subject to customary exceptions and limitations), including a pledge of all of the capital stock of substantially all of the U.S. wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries of such persons (with customary exceptions and limitations) and 65% of the capital stock of certain foreign restricted subsidiaries of such persons (with customary exceptions and limitations).
All obligations of the non-U.S. loan parties under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our and the other guarantors’ assets (subject to customary exceptions and limitations), including a pledge of all of the capital stock of substantially all of our wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries (with customary exceptions and limitations).
The Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain thresholds and exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur debt or liens, make investments (including in the form of loans and acquisitions), merge, liquidate or dissolve, sell property and assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries, pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock, alter the business we conduct, amend, prepay, redeem or purchase subordinated debt, or engage in transactions with our affiliates.
In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Facility requiring us to maintain a minimum consolidated net secured leverage ratio.
material indebtedness could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement, in which case the lenders could elect to accelerate payments under the Credit Agreement and terminate any commitments they have to provide future borrowings.
At any time prior to March 30, 2022, we may, at our option, redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus an applicable “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
At any time on or after March 30, 2022, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
In addition, at any time on or before March 30, 2022, we may to redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 105.5% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net proceeds of one or more equity offerings.
Any event of default under the Credit Agreement that leads to an acceleration of those amounts due also results in a default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes.
As of March 31, 2019, there was $2.0 billion in principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding.
In connection with the acquisition of DST, we assumed a mortgage with a principal amount of £21.0 million, which matures in October 2020 (“U.K.
Mortgage”) and a $4.1 million mortgage on property in the U.S.
Principal payments of £1.0 million are payable semi-annually in April and October of each year and accrued interest payable quarterly, with the outstanding balance due at maturity.
Our financial ratio became effective with the period ended September 30, 2018.
Any breach of this covenant could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement.
Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.
Additionally, under the Credit Agreement, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is also tied to baskets and ratios based on Consolidated EBITDA.
Consolidated EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used in key financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, which is the material facility supporting our capital structure and providing liquidity to our business.
Consolidated EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the Credit Agreement.
We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Consolidated EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with the specified financial ratio and other financial condition tests contained in the Credit Agreement.
Consolidated EBITDA does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs.
Further, the Credit Agreement requires that Consolidated EBITDA be calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters.
Further, it may not be comparable to the measure for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year.
The following is a reconciliation of net income to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in our Credit Agreement.
Acquired EBITDA reflects the EBITDA impact of significant businesses that were acquired during the period as if the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the period, as well as cost savings enacted in connection with acquisitions.
Purchase accounting adjustments include (a) an adjustment to increase revenues by the amount that would have been recognized if deferred revenue were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisitions, (b) an adjustment to increase personnel and commissions expense by the amount that would have been recognized if prepaid commissions and deferred personnel costs were not adjusted to fair value at the date of the acquisitions, and (c) an adjustment to increase rent expense by the amount that would have been recognized if lease obligations were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisitions.
Other includes expenses and income that are permitted to be excluded per the terms of our Credit Agreement from Consolidated EBITDA, a financial measure used in calculating our covenant compliance.
Calculated as the ratio of consolidated net secured funded indebtedness, net of cash and cash equivalents, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the Credit Agreement, for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ended on the measurement date.
Consolidated net secured funded indebtedness is comprised of indebtedness for borrowed money, letters of credit, deferred purchase price obligations and capital lease obligations, all of which is secured by liens on our property.
We adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as of January 1, 2019.
Prior period information was not restated and continues to be presented under ASC 840, Leases.
We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed us to not reassess existing contracts to determine if they contain a lease and to carry forward their historical lease classification upon transition.
In addition, we will not apply the guidance of ASC 842 to leases with an initial term of 12 months or less as allowed by the standard.
Our lease portfolio primarily consists of real estate office space with lease terms ranging from 1 to 15 years.
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets and lease payment obligations for our real estate office leases of $387.6 million and $417.8 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, $56.4 million of the lease liability was included in other accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
ASU 2016-13 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
ASU 2016-13 is effective for us for our first quarter of fiscal 2020 and earlier adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
