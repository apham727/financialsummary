Cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that have been powering the Internet since 1984. Across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud, our evolving intent-based technologies are constantly learning and adapting to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we saw broad-based growth across the business and delivered solid revenue growth, margins and operating cash flow. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. Our product revenue reflected solid growth in Infrastructure Platforms, Applications and Security, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions. Notwithstanding the first quarter fiscal 2019 results, we continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. 
In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased $401 million, EMEA revenue increased by $315 million, and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $219 million. These increases reflect broad strength across several countries within these segments. The “BRICM” countries experienced product revenue growth of 24% in the aggregate, driven by increased product revenue in the emerging countries of Mexico, India, Russia and Brazil of 64%, 55%, 23% and 1%, respectively, while product revenue in China was flat.
From a customer market standpoint, we experienced solid product revenue growth in the enterprise and service provider markets and, to a lesser extent, in the public sector and commercial markets. 
From a product category perspective, we saw broad-based growth across the portfolio. The product revenue increase of 9% was driven by a 9% product revenue increase in Infrastructure Platforms and solid product revenue growth in Applications and Security, which grew by 18% and 11% respectively. 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition. ASC 606 supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP on revenue recognition and eliminated industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services at an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. 
ASC 606 primarily impacted our revenue recognition for software arrangements and sales to two-tier distributors. In both areas, the new standard accelerates the recognition of revenue. 
We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.
We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.
Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. 
We apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes various rebate, cooperative marketing, and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.
The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.
A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018 was $112 million and $123 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. 
Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.
If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.
We hold non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of October 27, 2018, our non-marketable equity and other investments were $1.2 billion, compared with $1.1 billion as of July 28, 2018, and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. 
Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.
The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018 was $33.4 billion and $31.7 billion, respectively. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in each of the first quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018. 
The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets.
We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. 
Total revenue increased by 8%. Product revenue increased by 9% and service revenue increased by 3%. Our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced 24% product revenue growth, with increases in Mexico, India, Russia and Brazil and product revenue in China being flat. 
Product revenue in the Americas segment increased by 6%, led by solid growth in the enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, in the commercial, service provider and public sector markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 7% in United States, 22% in Canada, 64% in Mexico and 1% in Brazil.
Product revenue in the APJC segment increased by 16%, with solid growth across each of the customer markets in this geographic segment. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 55% in India and 8% in Japan while product revenue in China was flat.
The Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue increased by 9%, or $662 million, with strength across the portfolio. Switching had solid growth, with solid revenue growth in campus switching driven by an increase in sales of our intent-based networking Catalyst 9000 Series, and with revenue growth in data center switching driven by increased revenue from our Nexus 9000 Series. Routing returned to growth driven by growth in the service provider market. We experienced double digit revenue growth from wireless products driven by our Wave 2 offerings as well as Meraki. Our revenue from data center increased driven by higher sales of server products and our hyperconverged data center offering, HyperFlex. 
The Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and conferencing) as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) and analytics software offerings from Jasper and AppDynamics, respectively. Revenue in our Applications product category increased by 18%, or $216 million, with growth across all of the business. We had solid revenue growth in unified communications, Telepresence and analytics from AppDynamics. 
Revenue in our Security product category increased 11%, or $66 million, driven by higher sales of identity and access, advance threat security and unified threat management products. 
The decrease in revenue from our Other Products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from Service Provider Video Software Solutions (“SPVSS”). On May 1, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell the SPVSS business. We closed the sale on October 28, 2018. 
Service revenue increased 3%, driven by an increase in software and solution support offerings. Service revenue increased in the Americas and EMEA segments, partially offset by decreased revenue in our APJC segment. 
 (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.
Product gross margin increased by 1.5 percentage points driven by productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing. A charge of $122 million to product cost of sales recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 related to legal and indemnification settlements also contributed to the increase.
Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations and renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Another factor is the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.
 (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. 
The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. 
The increase in share-based compensation expense was due primarily to higher restructuring charges. 
Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased due to SPVSS purchased intangibles which were held for sale, partially offset by amortization from our recent acquisitions.
We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2018 in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $300 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expanded the restructuring plan to include an additional $300 million of estimated additional pretax charges. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $78 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and have incurred cumulative charges of $186 million since inception. We expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2019.
We incurred restructuring and other charges of $152 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 in connection with the restructuring plan announced in August 2016. 
These charges were primarily cash-based and consisted of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas. As a result, the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods.
Interest income decreased, driven by a decrease in the average balance of available-or-sale debt investments. The decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance, partially offset by the impact of higher effective interest rates. 
The total change in net gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt investments and marketable equity investments was primarily attributable to higher realized losses as a result of market conditions, and the timing of sales of these investments.
The change in net gains (losses) on non-marketable equity and other investments was primarily due to lower realized gains, partially offset by higher unrealized gains and lower impairment charges.
The change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by lower gains from customer lease terminations.
The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below. 
Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation  As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. 
Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. 
On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a $25 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $14.0 billion, with no termination date. We expect to utilize this remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases over the next 9 to 15 months. 
The purchase price for the shares of our stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to shareholders’ equity. We are required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as (i) a reduction to retained earnings and (ii) a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital. As a result of future stock repurchases, we may report an accumulated deficit in future periods in shareholders’ equity.
Our accounts receivable net, as of October 27, 2018 decreased by approximately 18%, as compared with the end of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the amount and timing of service billings, and also due to product billings being more linear in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Inventory as of October 27, 2018 decreased by 15% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2018. The decrease in inventory was due primarily to lower deferred cost of sales related to the adoption of ASC 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. 
Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.
Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables decreased by 3%. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.
Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. 
The volume of channel partner financing was $7.2 billion and $6.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $931 million and $953 million as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of October 27, 2018, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $335 million, of which approximately $98 million was recorded as deferred revenue.
Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of October 27, 2018.
Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018.
Deferred revenue decreased primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019. Of the total deferred revenue decrease related to ASC 606 of $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion relates to deferred product revenue and $0.2 billion relates to deferred service revenue. Of the adjustment to deferred product revenue, $1.3 billion relates to our recurring software and subscription offers, $0.6 billion relates to two-tier distribution, and the remainder relates to non-recurring software and other adjustments. 
We lease office space in many U.S. locations. Outside the United States, larger leased sites include sites in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Poland and the United Kingdom. We also lease equipment and vehicles. The future minimum lease payments under all of our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year as of October 27, 2018 were $1.2 billion.
In connection with the Tax Act, we recorded an income tax payable of $8.1 billion for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Amounts associated with the Tax Act are considered provisional and may be subject to further adjustment during the measurement period. We plan to pay the transition tax in installments over eight years in accordance with the Tax Act. Approximately $0.8 billion is payable in less than one year; $1.3 billion is payable between 1 to 3 years; another $1.3 billion is payable between 3 to 5 years; and the remaining $4.7 billion is payable in more than 5 years. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Funding Commitments We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $378 million as of October 27, 2018, compared with $223 million as of July 28, 2018.
We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”
Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On September 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program. On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a $25 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $14.0 billion, with no termination date.
For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements. Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
