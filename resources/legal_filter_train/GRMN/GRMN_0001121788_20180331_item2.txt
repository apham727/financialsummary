This report has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC" or the "Commission") in Washington, D.C. and can be obtained by contacting the SEC's public reference operations or obtaining it through the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.
Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any forward-looking statement concerning the Company.
The Company’s segments offer products through its network of independent dealers and distributors.
Adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was applied using the full retrospective method, and information for prior periods within Results of Operations have been restated accordingly.
The segment table located in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements sets forth the Company’s results of operations (in thousands) including net sales, gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company’s five segments during the periods shown.
For each line item in the table, the total of the outdoor, fitness, marine, auto, and aviation segments' amounts equals the amount in the condensed consolidated statements of income included in Item 1.
Net sales increased 11% for the 13-week period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the year-ago quarter.
Fitness was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 23% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 22% in the first quarter of 2017.
Auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in the first quarter of 2017 at 25% and declined to 20% in the first quarter of 2018.
Total unit sales decreased to 2,956 in the first quarter of 2018 from 3,099 in the same period of 2017.
Auto segment revenue decreased 12% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction.
The current quarter marine increase of 9% was primarily driven by sales of the newly acquired Navionics business.
Fitness segment revenues increased 20% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by advanced wearables and newly introduced products.
Revenues in the outdoor segment increased 24% from the year-ago quarter primarily driven by significant growth in the wearable category.
Cost of goods sold increased 6% in absolute dollars compared to the prior year quarter.
The increase in revenues outpaced the increase in cost of goods sold, which resulted in a 190 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
In the auto segment, the decline in cost of goods sold was largely consistent with the segment revenue declines.
The aviation segment increase in cost of goods was largely consistent with the increase in sales.
Gross profit dollars in the first quarter of 2018 increased 14% while gross margin increased 190 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017.
Advertising expense decreased 20% in absolute dollars compared to the year-ago quarter.
The overall decrease in absolute dollars was driven primarily by decreased cooperative advertising associated with customer mix and fitness media, partially offset by an increase in outdoor media.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased 15% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
The absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to personnel costs and expenses from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018.
All segments, except for marine, were relatively flat as a percent of revenues.
The marine segment increase as a percent of revenues was primarily due to expenses resulting from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018.
In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $19.8 million when compared with the year-ago quarter and increased 90 basis points as a percent of revenue.
Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.
Operating income increased 22% in absolute dollars and increased 180 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the first quarter of 2017.
Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds.
The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.
Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
The $0.8 million currency gain recognized in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling within the 13-weeks ended March 31, 2018.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.7% against the Euro and 3.7% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $8.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.0% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $12.7 million.
The remaining net currency gain of $2.7 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
The $37.5 million currency loss recognized in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling within the 13-weeks ended April 1, 2017.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 7.1% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $42.9 million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.3% against the Euro and 1.7% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $2.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
The remaining net currency gain of $1.9 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
The effective tax rate was 16.0% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to (169.8%) in the first quarter of 2017.
Excluding the effect of the $168.8 million revaluation of deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2017, the first quarter of 2018 effective tax rate decreased by 520 basis points primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate, as a result of U.S. tax reform passed in December 2017, and the net release of uncertain tax position reserves.
As a result of the above, net income for the 13-weeks ended March 31, 2018 was $129.4 million compared to $238.4 million for the 13-week period ended April 1, 2017, a decrease of $109 million.
As of March 31, 2018, we had $2,375.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
We primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash requirements may be used to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, fund strategic acquisitions, and fund share repurchases.
We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.
The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.
The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
See Note 8 for additional information regarding marketable securities.
Additionally, the year over year decrease in net income of $109.0 million was offset by other non-cash adjustments to net income of $135.3 million, including an income tax benefit of $168.8 million recognized in the first quarter of 2017 related to the revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets.
The $99.3 million increase in cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased net purchases of marketable securities of $88.8M and cash payments for acquisitions of $9.4 million.
The $26.6 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to decreased purchases of treasury stock under our share repurchase authorization of $27.9M.
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
There were no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates in the 13-week period ended March 31, 2018, other than those discussed in Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies”.
