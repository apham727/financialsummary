The following information supplements and amends the discussion set forth under Part I, Item 3 "Legal Proceedings" in the Companyâ€™s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017.
PulseOn Oy v. Garmin (Europe) Ltd.
On February 21, 2018, PulseOn Oy filed an application with the Court of Appeal in England seeking leave to appeal the judgment of the Patent Court issued on January 18, 2018, holding that no accused Garmin products infringed either of the Registered Community Designs asserted by PulseOn Oy.
It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters, or if not, what the impact might be.
Item 1A.
