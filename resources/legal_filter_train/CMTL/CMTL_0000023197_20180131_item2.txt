We are a leading provider of advanced communications solutions for both commercial and government customers worldwide.
Our solutions fulfill our customers’ needs for secure wireless communications in some of the most demanding environments, including those where traditional communications are unavailable or cost-prohibitive, and in mission-critical and other scenarios where performance is crucial.
•Commercial Solutions - serves commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments, that require advanced communication technologies to meet their needs.
This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) that have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment.
We believe this segment is a leading provider of satellite communications (such as satellite earth station modems and traveling wave tube amplifiers ("TWTA")), public safety systems (such as next generation 911 ("NG911") technologies) and enterprise application technologies (such as messaging and trusted location-based technologies).
•Government Solutions - serves large government end-users (including those of foreign countries) that require mission critical technologies and systems.
We believe this segment is a leading provider of command and control applications (such as the design, installation and operation of data networks that integrate computing and communications (including both satellite and terrestrial links)), ongoing network operation and management support services (including telecom expense management, project management and fielding and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals), troposcatter communications (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems, and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies (such as solid state high-power broadband amplifiers, enhanced position location reporting system (commonly known as "EPLRS") amplifier assemblies, identification friend or foe amplifiers, and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).
We consider certain accounting policies to be critical due to the estimation process involved in each.
Revenue Recognition.
We earn revenue from the sale of advanced communication solutions to customers around the world.
Sales of advanced communication solutions can consist of any one or a combination of items required by our customer including hardware, technology platforms and related support.
A large portion of our revenue from advanced communication solutions is derived from contracts relating to the design, development or manufacture of complex electronic equipment to a buyer’s specification or to provide services relating to the performance of such contracts and is recognized in accordance with FASB ASC 605-35.
For these contracts, we primarily apply the percentage-of-completion accounting method and generally recognize revenue based on the relationship of total costs incurred to total projected costs, or, alternatively, based on output measures, such as units delivered or produced.
Profits expected to be realized on such contracts are based on total estimated sales for the contract compared to total estimated costs, including warranty costs, at completion of the contract.
Long-term U.S. government cost-reimbursable type contracts are also specifically covered by FASB ASC 605-35.
We have been engaged in the production and delivery of goods and services on a continual basis under contractual arrangements for many years.
In addition, most government contracts have termination for convenience clauses that provide the customer with the right to terminate the contract at any time.
Such terminations could impact the assumptions regarding total contract revenues and expenses utilized in recognizing profit under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.
Historically, we have not experienced material terminations of our long-term contracts.
We also address customer acceptance provisions in assessing our ability to perform our contractual obligations under long-term contracts.
Historically, we have been able to perform on our long-term contracts.
We also derive a portion of our revenues for advanced communication solutions from contracts and purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products or performance of services.
Such revenues are recognized in accordance with the authoritative guidance contained in FASB ASC 605-25 "Revenue Recognition - Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements" ("FASB ASC 605-25") and, as applicable, FASB ASC 605-20 "Revenue Recognition - Services" ("FASB ASC 605-20") and Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2009-14 (FASB ASC Topic 985) "Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements."
Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.
In summary, we recognize revenue for each separate unit of accounting when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met.
We allocate revenue to each separate unit of accounting in a multi-element arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element, using vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of their fair values, if available.
VSOE is generally determined based on the price charged when an element is sold separately.
In the absence of VSOE of fair value, the fee is allocated among each element based on third-party evidence ("TPE") of fair value, which is determined based on competitor pricing for similar deliverables when sold separately.
When we are unable to establish fair value using VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price ("ESP") to allocate value to each element.
The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold separately.
We determine ESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, market conditions, competitive landscape, and pricing practices.
Due to the nature of some of the agreements it may be difficult to establish VSOE of separate elements of an agreement; in these circumstances the appropriate recognition of revenue may require the use of judgment based on the particular facts and circumstances.
Each of our two operating segments constitutes a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions in determining their estimated fair values.
In accordance with FASB ASC 350 "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other," we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods.
If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment ("quantitative assessment"), pursuant to our adoption of FASB ASU No.
2017-04 in fiscal 2017, we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
On August 1, 2017 (the first day of our fiscal 2018), we performed our annual quantitative assessment using market participant assumptions to determine if the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value.
In performing the quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approaches.
The discount rates used in our DCF method were based on a weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC") determined from relevant market comparisons, adjusted upward for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows).
A terminal value growth rate was applied to the final year of the projected period and reflected our estimate of stable, perpetual growth.
We then calculated a present value of the respective cash flows for each reporting unit to arrive at an estimate of fair value under the income approach.
Under the market approach, we estimated a fair value based on comparable companies' market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and factored in a control premium.
Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 17.8% and 52.9%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment.
However, in order to sensitize our goodwill impairment test, we performed a second analysis using only the income approach and concluded that neither reporting units' goodwill was impaired or at risk of failing the quantitative assessment.
In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2018 (the start of our fiscal 2019).
We believe that the carrying values of our net intangible assets were recoverable as of January 31, 2018.
Provision for Warranty Obligations.
We provide warranty coverage for most of our products, including products under long-term contracts, for a period of at least one year from the date of shipment.
Costs associated with some of our warranties that are provided under long-term contracts are incorporated into our estimates of total contract costs.
A portion of our deferred tax assets consist of federal net operating losses and federal research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards, most of which was acquired in connection with our acquisition of TCS.
This provision went into effect on January 1, 2018 and required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
In connection with Tax Reform, during the three months ended January 31, 2018, we recorded an estimated net discrete tax benefit of $14.0 million, primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities associated with non-deductible amortization related to intangible assets.
This remeasurement was recorded pursuant to ASC 740 "Income Taxes" and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 118, using estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and available information as of the reporting date.
As such, we expect to finalize this net discrete tax benefit during the second half of fiscal 2018.
Research and Development Costs.
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other personnel-related expenses associated with product development.
Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established.
Technological feasibility for our advanced communication software solutions is generally reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing.
Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
To date, we have not capitalized any of our internally developed software costs.
Provisions for Excess and Obsolete Inventory.
We perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness, as determined by our review of our customers’ current credit information.
Generally, we will require cash in advance or payment secured by irrevocable letters of credit before an order is accepted from an international customer that we do not do business with regularly.
We monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified.
In light of ongoing tight credit market conditions, we continue to see requests from our customers for higher credit limits and longer payment terms.
Because of our strong cash position and the nominal amount of interest we are earning on our cash and cash equivalents, we have, on a limited basis, approved certain customer requests.
We continue to monitor our accounts receivable credit portfolio.
•Net sales of $133.7 million;
•Operating income of $4.9 million;
•Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP financial measure discussed below) of $14.5 million.
As of January 31, 2018, our consolidated backlog was $567.3 million, which is close to our record high.
Our backlog does not include the unfunded portions of multi-year contracts.
As such, the total value of multi-year contracts that we have received is substantially higher.
Our pipeline of opportunities remains strong and overall business activity is at the highest level it has been in several years.
We believe that we can achieve fiscal 2018 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 5.0% as compared to fiscal 2017, and Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of consolidated fiscal 2018 net sales, comparable to the 12.8% we achieved in fiscal 2017.
In line with our original Business Outlook for Fiscal 2018, our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be the peak quarter - by far - for consolidated net sales, GAAP operating income and Adjusted EBITDA.
We currently believe that our third quarter consolidated net sales and Adjusted EBITDA will be approximately 10.0% higher than the related amounts we achieved in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
GAAP operating income and Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of consolidated third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales, are expected to approximate 4.0% and 11.0%, respectively, with significant increases in each metric in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Comparison of the Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 - Adjusted EBITDA."
On March 7, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on May 18, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 18, 2018.
Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval.
Additional information related to our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2018 is included in the below section entitled "Comparison of the Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017" and "Comparison of the Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017."
Net Sales.
Consolidated net sales were $133.7 million and $139.0 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a decrease of $5.3 million, or 3.8%.
Net sales by operating segment are discussed below.
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $85.8 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to $82.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2017, an increase of $3.7 million, or 4.5%.
Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 64.2% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to 59.1% for the three months ended January 31, 2017.
Bookings during the most recent fiscal quarter were strong and reflect continued strength in almost all of our Commercial Solutions product lines.
Our book-to-bill ratio (a measure defined as bookings divided by net sales) for the three months ended January 31, 2018 was 1.81.
As further discussed below, we have a growing pipeline of opportunities and expect that the book-to-bill ratio in this segment will exceed 1.00 for fiscal 2018.
Net sales of our satellite earth station products (which include satellite modems and solid-state power amplifiers ("SSPAs")) during the three months ended January 31, 2018 were higher than the three months ended January 31, 2017.
Market conditions overall for this product line continue to improve.
In fact, both bookings and sales for this quarter increased as compared to the respective amounts we achieved in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
We continue to see increased interest from U.S. government customers for our satellite earth station products and believe sales to U.S. government customers will noticeably improve in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.
For example, during the most recent fiscal quarter, we received a multi-year follow-on contract with a potential value of up to $19.1 million to provide Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command ("SPAWAR") with Advanced Time Division Multiple Access ("TDMA") Interface Processor ("ATIP") production terminals.
Net sales of our satellite earth station products are expected to benefit in fiscal 2018 from anticipated orders for our HeightsTM Dynamic Network Access Technology ("HEIGHTS" or "HDNA").
We believe HEIGHTS is a revolutionary technology that is designed to deliver the highest Internet Protocol bits per Hertz in its class, as well as robust reliability.
Although the sales cycle for this product line is longer than our historical satellite earth station product line sales cycle, to-date, we have announced several important customer wins for this product line and our pipeline of opportunities continues to grow.
In addition to the benefit of incrementally higher sales of HEIGHTS solutions, fiscal 2018 sales are expected to benefit from strong sales of our SSPAs used in airborne, in-flight connectivity applications.
Net sales during the three months ended January 31, 2018 of both enterprise technology solutions (such as our location and messaging platforms) and safety and security technology solutions (such as our wireless and next generation 911 ("NG911") platforms) were higher as compared to the net sales we achieved during the three months ended January 31, 2017.
During our second quarter of fiscal 2018, we were awarded a large multi-year strategic contract valued at $134.0 million to provide safety and security technology solutions to one of the largest wireless carriers in the U.S. As a result of this new contract, we will become the leading provider to this wireless carrier for E911 services for its nationwide 3G, 4G and 5G networks.
Our advanced solutions provided to this carrier will support both current 911 infrastructure and NG911 networks which enable text messaging, image, data and video processing.
This new contract, which was issued in the form of an amendment to an existing contract and previously received orders, resulted in a significant increase to our backlog.
We believe that our enterprise technology solutions continue to gain traction, particularly in international markets.
In our view, these contract awards validate that our enterprise technology solutions and safety and security technology solutions are more advanced, secure and reliable than any existing competitive technology.
Overall market conditions remain favorable and we expect that aggregate net sales of these solutions in fiscal 2018 will be higher than in fiscal 2017.
Overall, we expect fiscal 2018 net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment to be higher than fiscal 2017.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $47.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to $56.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2017, a decrease of $9.0 million, or 15.8%.
Our Government Solutions segment represented 35.8% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to 40.9% for the three months ended January 31, 2017.
Business activity in our over-the-horizon microwave systems product line is starting to pick-up.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we received multi-million dollar contract awards from two international customers.
Although we are involved in discussions and negotiations related to large international and U.S. military over-the-horizon microwave systems opportunities, our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2018 includes only a nominal amount of revenues from these large potential awards.
We believe the types of orders we are winning recently validate our tactical shift in strategy in this segment to focus on niche products with higher margins.
Importantly, during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we were awarded an initial $11.7 million order to provide several thousand of our next generation MT-2025 mobile satellite transceivers to support the BFT-2 system.
Initial shipments of transceivers are expected to start during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Additional orders for our MT-2025 are expected.
Although the timing of large contract awards makes it difficult to predict our book-to-bill ratio in any given period, we have a growing pipeline of opportunities and expect the book-to-bill ratio in this segment for fiscal 2018 to exceed 1.00.
Sales to U.S. government customers include sales to the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as sales directly to or through prime contractors.
Domestic sales include sales to commercial customers, as well as to U.S. state and local governments.
Included in domestic sales, are sales to Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon"), which represented 10.5% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2018.
Sales to Verizon were less than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the comparable prior year period.
International sales for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $35.4 million and $44.6 million, respectively.
Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017.
This decrease in gross profit dollars was largely driven by lower net sales in our Government Solutions segment, including the absence of $2.5 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, both of which are discussed above.
Gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, was 38.0% for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to 38.3% for the three months ended January 31, 2017.
The increase from 37.1% to 38.0% in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by favorable product mix changes including a greater percentage of our consolidated net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 occurring in our Commercial Solutions segment.
Our Commercial Solutions segment historically achieves higher gross margins than our Government Solutions segment.
Gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, is further discussed below.
Our Commercial Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended January 31, 2018 was higher than the comparable prior year period.
The increase was primarily due to higher net sales and overall favorable product mix changes during the most recent fiscal quarter.
We expect gross profit in this segment, as a percentage of related fiscal 2018 net sales, to be comparable to the percentage achieved in fiscal 2017.
Our Government Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended January 31, 2018 was lower than the comparable prior year period.
Included in consolidated cost of sales for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of $1.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $27.2 million and $31.0 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a decrease of $3.8 million.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 20.3% and 22.3% for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The decrease in spending, both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales, is primarily attributable to lower net sales, as discussed above, and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated.
Amortization of stock-based compensation expense recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses was $1.0 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017.
Research and Development Expenses.
Research and development expenses were $13.4 million and $13.3 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.8%.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 10.0% and 9.6% for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, was due primarily to the lower net sales during the most recent fiscal quarter, as discussed above.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, research and development expenses of $11.4 million and $11.0 million, respectively, related to our Commercial Solutions segment and $2.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively, related to our Government Solutions segment.
The remaining research and development expenses of $0.1 million for both the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the amortization of stock-based compensation expense.
Whenever possible, we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements.
During the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, customers reimbursed us $3.9 million and $7.8 million, respectively, which is not reflected in the reported research and development expenses, but is included in consolidated net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 research and development expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017.
Amortization relating to intangible assets with finite lives was $5.3 million (of which $4.4 million was for the Commercial Solutions segment and $0.8 million was for the Government Solutions segment) for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and $6.0 million (of which $4.4 million was for the Commercial Solutions segment and $1.6 million was for the Government Solutions segment) for the three months ended January 31, 2017.
The decrease is a result of certain intangibles that became fully amortized in fiscal 2017.
As such, we anticipate amortization of intangibles in fiscal 2018, in dollars, to be lower than in fiscal 2017.
During the three months ended January 31, 2017, we recorded a favorable adjustment to operating income of $10.0 million, net of estimated legal fees, to reflect a lower loss than originally estimated for a TCS intellectual property matter which was settled during that period.
The increase during the most recent fiscal quarter in our Commercial Solutions segment’s operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
We expect fiscal 2018 operating income in our Commercial Solutions segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to increase as compared to fiscal 2017.
The expected operating loss in our Government Solutions segment during the three months ended January 31, 2018 was driven by lower net sales, most notably significantly lower over-the-horizon microwave systems sales and the absence of $2.5 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
Given our expectations that sales of over-the-horizon microwave systems will increase during the third and fourth fiscal quarters, we anticipate achieving positive operating income in this segment in each of those quarters, with the fourth quarter expected to be the peak quarter.
In addition, we have made, and continue to make, cost reductions in this segment.
As such, operating income for this segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, is expected to be higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017.
Unallocated operating expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2018 were $3.7 million as compared to operating income of $4.6 million for the three months ended January 31, 2017 (which includes a favorable adjustment of $10.0 million, as discussed above).
Excluding the $10.0 million adjustment, unallocated operating expenses would have been $5.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2017.
The decrease from $5.4 million to $3.7 million primarily reflects the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated.
Unallocated expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 include amortization of stock-based compensation of $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
Amortization of stock-based compensation expense can fluctuate from period-to-period based on the type and timing of stock-based awards.
Based on the type of awards currently outstanding and awards expected to be issued in future periods, amortization of stock-based compensation is expected to be higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017.
Looking forward, our unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2018 are expected to significantly increase as compared to the $5.6 million of unallocated operating expenses for fiscal 2017.
During fiscal 2017, unallocated operating expenses were offset by a number of favorable adjustments throughout the fiscal year, which aggregated $18.8 million and which are more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC.
Excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments, unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2017 would have been $24.4 million.
Given our expected sales growth on a consolidated basis in fiscal 2018 and current spending plans, our unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2018 are expected to be comparable to fiscal 2017 unallocated operating expenses of $24.4 million, prior to the favorable adjustments discussed above.
On a consolidated basis, we are targeting to achieve operating income, as a percentage of net sales, of approximately 5.0% in fiscal 2018, which compares favorably with the 3.3% of consolidated net sales we achieved in fiscal 2017 (excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments to operating income discussed above).
Consolidated operating income, as a percentage of expected consolidated third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales, is expected to approximate 4.0% and increase significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Interest Expense.
Interest expense was $2.5 million and $2.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Interest expense for both periods primarily reflects interest on our Secured Credit Facility, as amended.
Based on the type, terms, amount of outstanding debt (including capital leases) and current interest rates, we estimate that our effective interest rate (including amortization of deferred financing costs) will approximate 5.3% in fiscal 2018.
Our actual cash borrowing rate (which excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs) currently approximates 4.0%.
Interest (Income) and Other.
Interest (income) and other for both the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 was nominal.
All of our available cash and cash equivalents are currently invested in bank deposits and money market deposit accounts which, at this time, are currently yielding a blended annual interest rate of approximately 0.63%.
Net Income.
The increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA during the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to overall product mix changes (including a higher percentage of consolidated net sales occurring in the Commercial Solutions segment as compared to the prior year period) and lower unallocated expenses, all of which are discussed above.
The increase in our Commercial Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent fiscal quarter was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
The decrease in our Government Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent fiscal quarter was primarily driven by lower net sales, most notably significantly lower sales of over-the-horizon microwave systems products and the absence of $2.5 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
An anticipated increase in this segment’s sales during each of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018 is expected to drive an increase in Adjusted EBITDA, in both dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, from the level we achieved in our most recent quarter.
Looking forward, we anticipate Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to approximate 11.0% and increase significantly in the fourth quarter.
Given our year-to-date performance, we are increasing our targeted fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to grow by approximately 5.0% over the $70.7 million we achieved in fiscal 2017.
We believe these targeted financial metrics demonstrate the strength of our business.
If order flow remains strong and we are able to achieve all of our fiscal 2018 business goals, it is possible that our targeted fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA financial metrics could be higher.
Our Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure that represents earnings (loss) before income taxes, interest (income) and other expense, interest expense, amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, depreciation expense, settlement of intellectual property litigation, acquisition plan expenses or strategic alternatives analysis expenses and other.
These Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary to conduct our business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP in the above table, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.
For example, quantification of stock-based compensation expense requires inputs such as the number of shares granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable.
Net Sales.
Consolidated net sales were $255.3 million and $274.8 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a decrease of $19.5 million, or 7.1%.
Net sales by operating segment are discussed below.
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $161.9 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to $158.3 million for the six months ended January 31, 2017, an increase of $3.6 million, or 2.3%.
Bookings during the six month period in fiscal 2018 were strong and reflect strength in almost all of our Commercial Solutions product lines.
Our book-to-bill ratio (a measure defined as bookings divided by net sales) for the six months ended January 31, 2018 was 1.66.
As further discussed below, we have a growing pipeline of opportunities and expect that the book-to-bill ratio in this segment will exceed 1.00 for fiscal 2018.
Net sales of our satellite earth station products (which include satellite modems and solid-state power amplifiers ("SSPAs")) during the six months ended January 31, 2018 were higher than the six months ended January 31, 2017.
Market conditions overall for this product line continue to improve.
We continue to see increased interest from U.S. government customers for our satellite earth station products and believe sales to U.S. government customers will noticeably improve in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.
For example, during the six months ended January 31, 2018, we received a multi-year follow-on contract with a potential value of up to $19.1 million to provide Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command ("SPAWAR") with Advanced Time Division Multiple Access ("TDMA") Interface Processor ("ATIP") production terminals.
Net sales of our satellite earth station products are expected to benefit in fiscal 2018 from anticipated orders for our HeightsTM Dynamic Network Access Technology ("HEIGHTS" or "HDNA").
We believe HEIGHTS is a revolutionary technology that is designed to deliver the highest Internet Protocol bits per Hertz in its class, as well as robust reliability.
Although the sales cycle for this product line is longer than our historical satellite earth station product line sales cycle, to-date, we have announced several important customer wins for this product line and our pipeline of opportunities continues to grow.
In addition to the benefit of incrementally higher sales of HEIGHTS solutions, fiscal 2018 sales are expected to benefit from strong sales of our SSPAs used in airborne, in-flight connectivity applications.
Overall, we expect fiscal 2018 net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment to be higher than fiscal 2017.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $93.4 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to $116.5 million for the six months ended January 31, 2017, a decrease of $23.1 million, or 19.8%.
Business activity in our over-the-horizon microwave systems product line is starting to pick-up.
During the six months ended January 31, 2018, we received multi-million dollar contract awards from two international customers.
Although we are involved in discussions and negotiations related to large international and U.S. military over-the-horizon microwave systems opportunities, our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2018 includes only a nominal amount of revenues from these large potential awards.
We believe the types of orders we are winning recently validate our tactical shift in strategy in this segment to focus on niche products with higher margins.
Importantly, during the six months ended January 31, 2018, we were awarded an initial $11.7 million order to provide several thousand of our next generation MT-2025 mobile satellite transceivers to support the BFT-2 system.
Initial shipments of transceivers are expected to start during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Additional orders for our MT-2025 are expected.
Although the timing of large contract awards makes it difficult to predict our book-to-bill ratio in any given period, we have a growing pipeline of opportunities and expect the book-to-bill ratio in this segment for fiscal 2018 to exceed 1.00.
Sales to U.S. government customers include sales to the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as sales directly to or through prime contractors.
Domestic sales include sales to commercial customers, as well as to U.S. state and local governments.
Included in domestic sales, are sales to Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon"), which represented 11.1% of consolidated net sales for the six months ended January 31, 2018.
Sales to Verizon were less than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the six months ended January 31, 2017.
International sales for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $63.7 million and $82.5 million, respectively.
The decrease of $6.8 million in gross profit dollars was largely driven by lower net sales in our Government Solutions segment, including the absence of $5.0 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, both of which are discussed above.
The increase in gross profit percentage is largely attributable to a greater percentage of our consolidated net sales during the six months ended January 31, 2018 occurring in our Commercial Solutions segment, which historically achieves higher gross margins than our Government Solutions segment, as well as a favorable warranty settlement during the six months ended January 31, 2018 that resulted in a $0.7 million reduction to cost of sales (which is reflected in our unallocated segment).
Gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, is further discussed below.
Our Commercial Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the six months ended January 31, 2018 was higher than the comparable prior year period.
The increase was primarily due to higher net sales and overall favorable product mix changes during the most recent six month period.
We expect gross profit in this segment, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for fiscal 2018 to be comparable to the percentage achieved in fiscal 2017.
Our Government Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the six months ended January 31, 2018 was lower as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2017.
In addition, our gross profit during the six months ended January 31, 2018 reflects an absence of $5.0 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
Included in consolidated cost of sales for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of $2.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $55.7 million and $63.7 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a decrease of $8.0 million.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 21.8% and 23.2% for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The decrease in spending, both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales, is primarily attributable to lower net sales, as discussed above, and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated.
Amortization of stock-based compensation expense recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses was $1.6 million and $1.7 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The most recent six month period includes a $0.4 million reversal of stock-based compensation expense related to certain performance shares previously expected to be earned.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017.
Research and Development Expenses.
Research and development expenses were $27.2 million and $27.4 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a decrease of $0.2 million, or 0.7%.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 10.7% and 10.0% for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, was due primarily to the lower net sales during the most recent six month period, as discussed above.
For the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, research and development expenses of $23.2 million and $22.7 million, respectively, related to our Commercial Solutions segment and $3.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively, related to our Government Solutions segment.
The remaining research and development expenses of $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the amortization of stock-based compensation expense.
Whenever possible, we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 research and development expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017.
Amortization relating to intangible assets with finite lives was $10.5 million (of which $8.8 million was for the Commercial Solutions segment and $1.7 million was for the Government Solutions segment) for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and $12.1 million (of which $8.8 million was for the Commercial Solutions segment and $3.2 million was for the Government Solutions segment) for the six months ended January 31, 2017.
The decrease is a result of certain intangibles that became fully amortized in fiscal 2017.
As such, we anticipate amortization of intangibles in fiscal 2018, in dollars, to be lower than in fiscal 2017.
During the six months ended January 31, 2017, we recorded a favorable adjustment to operating income of $10.0 million, net of estimated legal fees, to reflect a lower loss than originally estimated for a TCS intellectual property matter which was settled during that period.
The increase during the most recent six month period in our Commercial Solutions segment’s operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
We expect fiscal 2018 operating income in our Commercial Solutions segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to increase as compared to fiscal 2017.
The expected operating loss in our Government Solutions segment during the six months ended January 31, 2018 was driven by lower net sales, most notably significantly lower over-the-horizon microwave systems sales and the absence of $5.0 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
Given our expectations that sales of over-the-horizon microwave systems will increase during the third and fourth fiscal quarters, we anticipate achieving positive operating income in this segment in each of those quarters, with the fourth quarter expected to be the peak quarter.
In addition, we have made, and continue to make, cost reductions in this segment.
As such, operating income for this segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, is expected to be higher in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.
Unallocated operating expenses for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 were $7.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
Excluding a $0.7 million favorable warranty settlement and a $10.0 million adjustment (both as discussed above), unallocated operating expenses for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 would have been $8.4 million and $11.7 million, respectively.
Unallocated expenses for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 include amortization of stock-based compensation of $1.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
The decrease was primarily due to the reversal of $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense related to certain performance shares that were previously expected to be earned.
Amortization of stock-based compensation expense can fluctuate from period-to-period based on the type and timing of stock-based awards.
Based on the type of awards currently outstanding and awards expected to be issued in future periods, total amortization of stock-based compensation is expected to be higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017.
Looking forward, our unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2018 are expected to significantly increase as compared to the $5.6 million of unallocated operating expenses for fiscal 2017.
During fiscal 2017, unallocated operating expenses were offset by a number of favorable adjustments throughout the fiscal year, which aggregated $18.8 million and which are more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC.
Excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments, unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2017 would have been $24.4 million.
Given our expected sales growth on a consolidated basis in fiscal 2018 and current spending plans, our unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2018 are expected to be comparable to fiscal 2017 unallocated operating expenses of $24.4 million, prior to the favorable adjustments discussed above.
We are targeting to achieve operating income, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, of approximately 5.0% in fiscal 2018, which compares favorably with the 3.3% of consolidated net sales we achieved in fiscal 2017 (excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments to operating income discussed above).
Consolidated operating income, as a percentage of expected consolidated third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales, is expected to approximate 4.0% and increase significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Interest Expense.
Interest expense was $5.1 million and $6.2 million for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Interest expense for both periods primarily reflects interest on our Secured Credit Facility, as amended.
Based on the type, terms, amount of outstanding debt (including capital leases) and current interest rates, we estimate that our effective interest rate (including amortization of deferred financing costs) will approximate 5.3% in fiscal 2018.
Our actual cash borrowing rate (which excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs) currently approximates 4.0%.
Interest (Income) and Other.
Interest (income) and other for both the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 was nominal.
All of our available cash and cash equivalents are currently invested in bank deposits and money market deposit accounts which, at this time, are currently yielding a blended annual interest rate of approximately 0.63%.
Net Income.
The increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA during the six months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to overall favorable product mix changes (including a higher percentage of consolidated net sales, occurring in the Commercial Solutions segment as compared to the prior year period) and lower unallocated expenses, all of which are discussed above.
The increase in our Commercial Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent six month period, was primarily attributable to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
The decrease in our Government Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent six month period was primarily driven by lower net sales, most notably significantly lower sales of over-the-horizon microwave systems products and the absence of $5.0 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above.
An anticipated increase in this segment’s sales during each of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018 is expected to drive an increase in Adjusted EBITDA, in both dollars and as a percentage of related net sales, from the level we achieved in our most recent quarter.
Looking forward, we anticipate Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to approximate 11.0% and increase significantly in the fourth quarter.
Given our year-to-date performance, we are increasing our targeted fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to grow by approximately 5.0% over the $70.7 million we achieved in fiscal 2017.
We believe these targeted financial metrics demonstrate the strength of our business.
If order flow remains strong and we are able to achieve all of our fiscal 2018 business goals, it is possible that our targeted fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA financial metrics could be higher.
Our Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure that represents earnings (loss) before income taxes, interest (income) and other expense, interest expense, amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, depreciation expense, settlement of intellectual property litigation, acquisition plan expenses or strategic alternatives analysis expenses and other.
These Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary to conduct our business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP in the above table, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.
For example, quantification of stock-based compensation expense requires inputs such as the number of shares granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable.
Our investment policy relating to our cash and cash equivalents is intended to minimize principal loss while at the same time maximize the income we receive without significantly increasing risk.
To minimize risk, we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market mutual funds (both government and commercial), certificates of deposit, bank deposits, and U.S. Treasury securities.
Many of our money market mutual funds invest in direct obligations of the U.S. government, bank securities guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, certificates of deposit and commercial paper and other securities issued by other companies.
Ultimately, the availability of our cash and cash equivalents is dependent on a well-functioning liquid market.
As of January 31, 2018 and March 7, 2018, an aggregate registered amount of $75.0 million under our existing Shelf Registration Statement filed with the SEC remains available for sale of various types of securities, including debt.
As of January 31, 2018 and March 7, 2018, we were authorized to repurchase up to an additional $8.7 million of our common stock, pursuant to our current $100.0 million stock repurchase program.
There were no repurchases of our common stock during the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017.
On September 27, 2017 and December 6, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, which were paid on November 17, 2017 and February 16, 2018, respectively.
On March 7, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on May 18, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 18, 2018.
Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval.
We continue to receive (and approve on a limited basis) requests from our customers for higher credit limits and longer payment terms.
We also continue to monitor our accounts receivable credit portfolio and have not had material negative customer credit experiences historically.
We have historically met both our short-term and long-term cash requirements with funds provided by a combination of cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operating activities and cash generated from financing transactions.
Based on our anticipated level of future sales and operating income, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, our cash generated from operating activities and amounts potentially available under the Revolving Loan Facility under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, will be sufficient to meet both our currently anticipated short-term and long-term operating cash requirements.
On February 23, 2016, in connection with our acquisition of TCS, we entered into a $400.0 million secured credit facility (the "Secured Credit Facility") with a syndicate of lenders.
The proceeds of these borrowings were primarily used to finance our acquisition of TCS, including the repayment of certain existing indebtedness of TCS.
Under the Revolving Loan Facility, we had outstanding balances ranging from $41.9 million to $66.8 million during six months ended January 31, 2018.
The Revolving Loan Facility is primarily used for working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the issuance of letters of credit.
The Applicable Rate is determined based on a pricing grid that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
The Secured Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants and customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions, on (i) liens, (ii) investments, (iii) indebtedness, (iv) significant corporate changes, including mergers and acquisitions, (v) dispositions, (vi) restricted payments, including stockholder dividends, and (vii) certain other restrictive agreements.
The Secured Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants and customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate), such as payment defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency, the occurrence of a defined change in control and the failure to observe the negative covenants and other covenants related to the operation of our business.
As of January 31, 2018, our Leverage Ratio was 2.78x TTM Consolidated EBITDA compared to the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio of 3.35x TTM Consolidated EBITDA.
During the second half of fiscal 2018, the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio will decrease each quarter until reaching 3.00x TTM Consolidated EBITDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, with no further reductions thereafter.
Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as of January 31, 2018 was 2.09x compared to the minimum required Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25x.
Given our expected future business performance, we anticipate maintaining compliance with the terms and financial covenants in our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, for the foreseeable future.
The obligations under the Secured Credit Facility, as amended, are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Guarantors").
As collateral security for amounts outstanding under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, and the guarantees thereof, we and our Subsidiary Guarantors have granted to an administrative agent, for the benefit of the lenders, a lien on, and first priority security interest in, substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Secured Credit Facility, dated as of February 23, 2016, and the First Amendment of the Secured Credit Facility, dated as of June 6, 2017, both of which have been documented and filed with the SEC.
In the normal course of business, other than as discussed below, we routinely enter into binding and non-binding purchase obligations primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment.
We do not expect that these commitments, as of January 31, 2018, will materially adversely affect our liquidity.
As discussed further in "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (9) - Secured Credit Facility," on June 6, 2017, we entered into the June 2017 Amendment to our Secured Credit Facility.
In connection with this amendment, the balloon or final payment of the Term Loan Facility, which is not due until February 23, 2021, was reduced by $22.5 million through increased borrowings from the Revolving Loan Facility which is not required to be repaid in full until February 23, 2021.
As discussed further in "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (17) - Stockholders’ Equity," on March 7, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on May 18, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 18, 2018.
Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval.
At January 31, 2018, we had $2.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, related to our guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts.
Such amounts are not included in the above table.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these agreements due to a history of nominal claims in the Comtech legacy business and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
As discussed further in "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (18) - Legal Proceedings and Other Matters," TCS is a party to one indemnification matter and we are incurring ongoing legal expenses in connection with this matter.
Our insurance policies may not cover the cost of defending indemnification claims or providing indemnification.
We have change in control agreements, severance agreements and indemnification agreements with certain of our executive officers and certain key employees.
All of these agreements may require payments by us, in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, a change in control of our Company or an involuntary termination of employment without cause.
Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2018 includes total liabilities of $9.0 million for uncertain tax positions, including interest, any or all of which may result in a cash payment.
The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of any potential cash settlement with the taxing authorities.
We are required to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") which is the source for all authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which is commonly referred to as "GAAP."
The FASB ASC is subject to updates by the FASB, which are known as Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs").
