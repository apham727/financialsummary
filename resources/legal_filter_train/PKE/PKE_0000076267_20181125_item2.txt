The higher gross profit margins from continuing operations for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were principally a result of higher sales, reduced salaried headcount, primarily through attrition, and the partially fixed nature of overhead expenses in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.

Interest income decreased 46% and 51%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 primarily as a result of lower average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates.

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
This guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and expands the related disclosure requirements.
In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance for one year.
A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue.
The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.
