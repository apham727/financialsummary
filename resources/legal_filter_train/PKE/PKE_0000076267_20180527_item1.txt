There have been no significant changes to such accounting policies during the 13 weeks ended  May 27, 2018.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The fair value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying value due to their short-term nature.
Due to the variable interest rates periodically adjusting with the current LIBOR, the carrying value of outstanding borrowings under the Company’s long-term debt approximates its fair value.
The Company’s non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include goodwill and any long-lived assets written down to fair value.
To measure fair value of such assets, the Company uses Level 3 inputs consisting of techniques including an income approach and a market approach.
The income approach is based on a discounted cash flow analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, terminal values, growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
There were no transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy during the 13 weeks ended  May 27, 2018 and  May 28, 2017.
With respect to goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value.
If, based on that assessment, the Company believes it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value, a goodwill impairment test is performed.
There have been no changes in events or circumstances which required impairment charges to be recorded during the 13 weeks ended  May 27, 2018.
All marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in comprehensive earnings.
The costs of securities sold are based on the specific identification method.
On  January 15, 2016, the Company entered into a three-year revolving credit facility agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with HSBC Bank USA, National Association (“HSBC Bank”).

On  January 3, 2018, in connection with the Company’s prepayment of the entire loan balance, the Company terminated the Credit Agreement.
The prepayment was made with the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash.
Interest expense recorded under the Credit Agreement was $0 and $510 during the 13-week periods ended  May 27, 2018 and  May 28, 2017, respectively.

The Plan terminated on May 21, 2018, and authority to grant additional options under the Plan expired on that date.
All options granted under the Plan will expire in April 2028 or earlier.

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of (a) the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and (b) the potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period.
Stock options are the only potentially dilutive securities; and the number of dilutive options is computed using the treasury stock method.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) or a comparable state agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “Superfund Act”) or similar state law as potentially responsible parties in connection with alleged releases of hazardous substances at three sites.
Under the Superfund Act and similar state laws, all parties who  may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste disposal site or contaminated area identified by the EPA or comparable state agency  may be jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have been accused of or charged with any wrongdoing or illegal acts in connection with any such sites.
The insurance carriers which provided general liability insurance coverage to the Company and its subsidiaries for the years during which the Company’s subsidiaries’ waste was disposed at these sites have in the past reimbursed the Company and its subsidiaries for 100% of their legal defense and remediation costs associated with two of these sites.
The total costs incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with these sites, including legal fees incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries and their assessed share of remediation costs and excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed by insurance carriers, were approximately $1 and $1 during the 13 weeks ended  May 27, 2018 and  May 28, 2017, respectively.

Pursuant to such general liability insurance coverage, three insurance carriers reimburse the Company and its subsidiaries for 100% of the legal defense and remediation costs associated with the two sites.
The Company accrues estimated costs associated with known environmental matters, when such costs can be reasonably estimated and when the outcome appears probable.
In  May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
This guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and expands the related disclosure requirements.
In  August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance for one year.
