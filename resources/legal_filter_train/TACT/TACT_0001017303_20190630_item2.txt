Terminals over the balance of 2019 relating to these commitments.
hardware and software could include 2,000 to 3,000 more locations over the next two to three years.
In July 2019, TransAct announced that it has secured a new agreement with a large U.S. foodservice provider for the deployment of the BOHA!
hardware and software solutions by 2019 year end with an additional approximately 250 locations expected to go live over the following two years.
SaaS based apps and is expected to occur by the end of 2019.
We have reviewed those policies and determined that they remain our critical accounting policies for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Net sales for the second quarter of 2019 decreased $3.4 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018.
The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware remained consistent during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
International sales for the second quarter of 2019 decreased $0.8 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 due primarily to a 27% decrease in sales in the international casino and gaming market.
terminal sales to two large corporate customers in the second quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur in the second quarter of 2019.
software recognized on a SaaS subscription basis increased by 24% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2019.
The decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 26% decrease in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, largely to McDonald’s.
We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 to McDonald’s to be lower in 2019 compared to 2018.
During 2018 we had a large sale to an OEM which did not reoccur in 2019.
This decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
Additionally, we had slightly higher revenue from recurring EPICENTRALTM annual software maintenance fees during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
We did not complete any new installations of our EPICENTRAL™ software systems in the second quarter of 2019 or 2018.
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the prior year period was due primarily to 49% lower sales of replacement parts including lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
This decrease was partially offset by increases in our service revenue of 49% and label sales related to our restaurant solutions products of 131%.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 50% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers.
For the second quarter of 2019, gross profit decreased $1.3 million, or 18%, due to a 23% decline in sales during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
This decrease in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in our gross margin of 290 basis points in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
We expect engineering, design and product development expenses in 2019 to be consistent with 2018.
During the second quarter of 2019, higher compensation expenses, related to the hiring of additional outside and technical sales and marketing staff to support the expected growth in our restaurant solutions business, were almost entirely offset by decreased marketing expenses in our other markets.
General and administrative expenses increased $80 thousand, or 4%, for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses.
These increases were partially offset by lower recruiting expense incurred during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to additional investment to support restaurant solutions.
We recorded net interest expense of $7 thousand in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $6 thousand in the second quarter of 2018.
We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the full year 2019.
We recorded other expense of $142 thousand in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $97 thousand in the second quarter of 2018 due to higher foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the second quarter of 2019.
Going forward, we may continue to experience more foreign exchange gains or losses depending on the level of sales to Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and the change in exchange rates of the Euro and Pound Sterling against the U.S. dollar.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was lower as it included the foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well as near breakeven pre-tax income in the second quarter of 2019.
We expect our effective tax rate to be between 7% and 9% for the full year 2019.
Net Income.
We reported net income for the second quarter of 2019 of $186 thousand, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to $1.2 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2018.
Net sales for the first half of 2019 decreased $4.1 million, or 15%, from the same period in 2018.
The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware increased 2% during the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018.
International sales decreased $300 thousand, or 5%, primarily driven by an 11% decrease of international casino and gaming sales.
This decrease was partially offset by a 55% increase from our international TSG market in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018.
This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal.
International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 terminal through our Asian and European distributors.
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 was primarily driven by a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased during the first half of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
International POS automation and banking sales decreased due to lower sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald’s during the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018.
The decrease in international sales in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 was due primarily to a 30% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia.
Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
International Printrex sales increased due to a 44% increase in international sales of our oil and gas printers during the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018.
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the first half of 2019 as compared to the first half of 2018 was due primarily to 42% lower sales of replacement parts due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
This decrease was partially offset by increased service revenue of 36% as well as higher label sales related to our restaurant solutions products of 230%.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased during the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 primarily due to a 74% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers.
Gross profit decreased $1.1 million, or 8% in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 due to a 15% decline in sales during the first half of 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.
The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by a 390 basis point increase in gross margin during the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018.
General and administrative expenses increased $158 thousand, or 4%, in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses.
These increases were partially offset by lower recruiting expense incurred during the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018.
Our operating income decreased $1.4 million, or 56%, during the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 due to a decrease in sales of 15% and a 3% increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a 390 basis point increase of gross margin during the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018.
We recorded net interest expense of $13 thousand in the first six months of 2019 compared to $14 thousand in the first six months of 2018.
We recorded other expense of $52 thousand in the first six months of 2019 compared to $87 thousand in the first six months of 2018 due to lower foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018.
We recorded an income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2019 of $89 thousand at an effective tax rate of 8.7%, compared to an income tax provision during the six months ended June 30, 2018 of $486 thousand at an effective tax rate of 20.4%.
The effective tax rate for the six months ended 2019 was lower due to the inclusion of the FDII deduction and the impact on the tax rate of lower pre-tax income.
Net Income.
For the first six months of 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $0.4 million, or 8%, from December 31, 2018.
We ended the second quarter of 2019 with $4.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $0.4 million was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.

On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022.
Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets.
We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line.
The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.
As of June 30, 2019, borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million.
In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board’s approval each quarter.
Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017.
Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $0.7 million or $0.09 per share in the second quarter of both 2019 and 2018.
On July 31, 2019, our Board of Directors approved the third quarter 2019 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about September 16, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on August 20, 2019.
Dividends declared and paid totaled $1.3 million, or $0.18 per share, for both the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”).
Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors.
The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time.
We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account.
Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we repurchased no shares of our common stock.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased 156,510 shares of our common stock for approximately $2.0 million at an average price per share of $12.78.
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, and dividend payments, and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.
The disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2018.
