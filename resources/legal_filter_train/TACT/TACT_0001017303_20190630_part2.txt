 Item 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS      
 Item 1A.   RISK FACTORS      
In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to depart from the European Union, known as Brexit and subsequently notified the European Council of its intention to leave the E.U. and began to negotiate the terms of the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. upon exit. We have taken certain actions in response to Brexit and in anticipation of E.U. legal requirements and the U.K.â€™s separation from the E.U. The potential impact from Brexit on us and on our results of operations is unclear. The actual effects of Brexit will depend upon many factors, including the final results of the Brexit negotiations. We do not, however, expect Brexit to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations as 15% and 10% of our total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, are attributable to our U.K. operations. However, we cannot predict the direction Brexit-related matters may take or the impact on our European operations, including our U.K. subsidiary.
