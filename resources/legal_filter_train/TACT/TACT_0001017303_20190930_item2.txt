We have reviewed those policies and determined that they remain our critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Net sales for the third quarter of 2019 decreased $4.2 million, or 26%, from the same period in 2018.
The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware increased 3% during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 due primarily to a lower level of lottery printer sales and POS automation and banking printer sales, which sell at a lower price than our other products.
software, labels and other recurring revenue.
software recognized on a SaaS subscription basis, labels and other recurring revenue increased by 267%, including an over 250% increase in label sales and a ten-fold increase in software sales (though off of a low base in the third quarter of 2018) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.
Hardware sales increased by 2% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.

solution, which includes hardware as well as recurring software subscription revenue, service and label sales.
The decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue for the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 26% decrease in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, largely to McDonald’s.
We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to McDonald’s to be lower for the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018.
These decreases were partially offset by slightly higher revenue from recurring EPICENTRALTM annual software maintenance fees during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.
We did not complete any new installations of our EPICENTRAL™ software systems in the third quarter of 2019 or 2018.
The decrease in international sales of our casino and gaming products in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 was due to a 20% decrease in sales of our thermal casino printers due primarily to lower sales to a large OEM in Europe.
The decrease was partially offset by 37% higher international sales of our off-premise gaming printers during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, primarily to an OEM in Europe for sports betting, as well as stronger sales in Australia.
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the prior year period was due primarily to lower sales of replacement parts including lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
This decrease was partially offset by increased service revenue of 48% resulting largely from increased repairs of POS printers for McDonald’s.
Internationally, TSG revenue decreased in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 due primarily to a decline of international consumable product sales of 77% and, to a lesser extent, a 6% decline in international sales of replacement parts and accessories.
For the third quarter of 2019, gross profit decreased $2.5 million, or 31%, due primarily to a 26% decline in sales during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.
Such expenses decreased $58 thousand, or 5% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to lower expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
Such expenses increased $149 thousand, or 8%, for the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.
During the third quarter of 2019, we incurred higher compensation expenses related to the hiring of additional outside and technical sales and marketing staff as well as higher promotional marketing expenses to support the expected growth in our restaurant solutions market.
General and administrative expenses increased $351 thousand, or 19%, for the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses and higher recruiting expenses for the new sales and marketing staff to support the restaurant solutions market.
We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018 due to additional investment to support restaurant solutions.
Additionally, operating expenses increased 9% during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.
We recorded no net interest income or expense in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $7 thousand of net interest expense in the third quarter of 2018.
We expect that net interest expense will be slightly lower in the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018, as interest income earned on the note receivable will largely offset interest expense incurred on unused borrowings under our revolving credit line.
We recorded other expense of $71 thousand in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $50 thousand in the third quarter of 2018 due to higher foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the third quarter of 2019.
Going forward, we may continue to experience more foreign exchange gains or losses depending on the level of sales to Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and the change in exchange rates of the Euro and Pound Sterling against the U.S. dollar.
Net Income.
We reported net income for the third quarter of 2019 of $384 thousand, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to $2.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2018.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2019 decreased $8.2 million, or 19%, from the same period in 2018.
These volume decreases were primarily due to a 24% decrease in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 26% and 54% unit decrease in our POS automation and banking market and lottery market, respectively.
The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware increased 2% during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
International sales decreased $0.6 million, or 8%, primarily driven by an 11% decrease of international casino and gaming sales.
This decrease was partially offset by a 24% increase from our international TSG market and a 41% increase from our international restaurant solutions market during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
Sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages).
Note that we have reclassified sales of labels and other recurring revenue items, which includes extended warranty and service contracts, and technical support services previously included in TSG to Restaurant Solutions for all periods presented in this Report.

software recognized on a SaaS subscription basis, labels and other recurring revenue increased by 291%, including a 241% increase in label sales and a twenty-fold increase in software sales (though off a low base in the first nine months of 2018).
Hardware sales declined by 16% on lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor and lower sales of our BOHA!
terminal to a convenience store supplier and increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal.
solutions to a casino operator in Asia.
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 was primarily driven by a 25% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
The decrease in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products for the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 was due primarily to a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer, driven primarily by a large order from a domestic casino operator for replacement printers during 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019, as well as lower sales to our domestic OEMs.
Additionally, domestic sales of our off-premise gaming printers decreased 95% during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due to sales to an OEM in the 2018 period that we do not expect to reoccur in 2019.
Domestic EPICENTRAL™ software sales decreased 38%, as we had no new installations during the first nine months of 2019 compared to one new installation during the same period for 2018.
The decrease in international sales in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 was due to a 9% decline in international sales of our thermal casino printer due to lower European sales and a 19% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia.
Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
This decrease was partially offset by higher sales from the international medical and mobile market during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
Sales in our worldwide TSG market for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages).
Note that we have reclassified sales of labels, extended warranty and service contracts, and technical support services related to our Restaurant Solutions market, which were previously included in TSG, to Restaurant Solutions for all periods presented in this Report.
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the first nine months of 2019 as compared to the first nine months of 2018 was due primarily to 37% lower sales of replacement parts due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to a 38% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers.
This increase was partially offset by a 41% decrease of international consumable sales during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
Gross profit decreased $3.5 million, or 17%, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due largely to a 19% decline in sales during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by a 140 basis point increase in gross margin during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
Selling and marketing expenses increased $440 thousand, or 8%, during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due primarily to higher compensation expenses related to the hiring of additional outside sales, technical sales and marketing staff and higher promotional marketing expenses for our restaurant solutions market.
General and administrative expenses increased $509 thousand, or 8%, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses.
These increases were partially offset by lower recruiting and employee termination expenses incurred during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
Our operating income decreased $4.3 million, or 75%, during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due to a decrease in sales of 19% and a 5% increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a 140 basis point increase of gross margin during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
We recorded net interest expense of $13 thousand in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $21 thousand in the first nine months of 2018 due to interest income earned on the note receivable during the third quarter of 2019 partially offsetting interest expense.
We recorded other expense of $123 thousand in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $137 thousand in the first nine months of 2018 due to lower foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended 2019 was unusually low and a benefit due to the inclusion of the FDII deduction and the impact of lower pre-tax income.
The FDII deduction was not included in the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 as the interpretive guidance for the deduction was not yet released.
Net Income.
For the first nine months of 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $3.5 million, or 74%, from December 31, 2018.
We ended the third quarter of 2019 with $1.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $0.2 million was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.
  ●  We reported net income of $1.3 million.
  ●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.7 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.6 million.
  ●  Accounts receivable increased $0.4 million, or 5%, due to sales for the third quarter 2019 occurring late in the quarter.
  ●  Other current and long term assets increased $0.6 million, or 81% due primarily to an advanced payment of royalty fees to a technology partner for restaurant solutions.

  ●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.7 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.5 million.

  ●  Accounts payable increased $2.5 million, or 65%, due to increased inventory purchases made during the third quarter of 2018.

On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022.
Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all our assets.
We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line.
The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.
Following the waiver, we had borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit Facility of $20 million.
In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board’s approval each quarter.
Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017.
Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $0.7 million or $0.09 per share in the third quarter of both 2019 and 2018.
On October 31, 2019, our Board of Directors approved the fourth quarter 2019 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about December 16, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on November 20, 2019.
Dividends declared and paid totaled $2 million, or $0.27 per share, for both the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”).
The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time.
We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account.
Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we repurchased no shares of our common stock.
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, and dividend payments, and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months.
The disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations since December 31, 2018.
