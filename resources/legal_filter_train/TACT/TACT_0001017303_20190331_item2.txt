Our product distribution spans across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean Islands and the South Pacific. We also offer world-class service, support, spare parts, accessories and printing supplies to our growing worldwide base of products currently in use by our customers.

Through our webstore, www.transactsupplies.com, and our direct selling team, we address the demand for these products.

Net sales for the first quarter of 2019 decreased $0.7 million, or 6%, from the same period in 2018. Printer, terminal and other hardware sales volume decreased 11% to approximately 28,000 units driven primarily by a 27% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and a 5% decrease in unit volume in the casino and gaming market. The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware increased 4% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to lower POS automation and banking sales, which sell at a lower price than our other products.  
International sales for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.5 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 primarily due to increased sales in the international casino and gaming market.  
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was driven largely by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate XL2e terminal, which has since been rebranded to the BOHA! terminal. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, we recognized our first sales of BOHA! software on a SaaS subscription basis. We expect sales of our restaurant solutions products to increase in 2019 compared to 2018 following the launch of our new BOHA! solution.  
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 to McDonald’s to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018. 
International casino and gaming product sales increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to a 77% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers largely to customers in Asia. This increase was partially offset by a 70% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. 
We expect domestic and international casino and gaming sales in 2019 to be relatively consistent with the sales levels achieved during 2018. 
The increase in sales of Printrex printers for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 resulted from higher domestic and international sales in the oil and gas market. We expect total Printrex sales to increase slightly for 2019 compared to 2018, as we expect to benefit from a continued modest recovery in the oil and gas industry.  
The increase in domestic revenue from TSG for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to an increase in label sales and increased service revenue related to our restaurant solutions products. Sales of our restaurant solutions labels were five times higher on a growing installed base of AccuDate and BOHA! terminals. Service revenue also increased 24% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, we had a 18% increase in sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers. We do not expect this trend to continue for HP inkjet cartridges as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018. These increases were offset by a 31% decrease in sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments for replacement parts, primarily from IGT, for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018. 
Internationally, TSG revenue increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 102% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers. 
Gross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations of our EPICENTRALTM print system. For the first quarter of 2019, gross profit increased $224 thousand, or 4%, despite a sales decrease of 6% for the first quarter in 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. Our gross margin increased 480 basis points, increasing to 52.7% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 47.9% for the first quarter of 2018. The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology driven solutions, as well as lower sales of POS printers, which carry lower margins than our other products. 
Interest. We recorded net interest expense of $6 thousand for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $8 thousand for the first quarter of 2018. We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the full year 2019. 
Other, net. We recorded other income of $90 thousand for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $10 thousand for the first quarter of 2018. The increase in other income was due to higher foreign currency exchange gains recorded by our U.K. subsidiary for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. Going forward, we may continue to experience more foreign exchange gains or losses depending on the level of sales to Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and the change in exchange rates of the Euro and Pound Sterling against the U.S. dollar. 
For the first three months of 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $2.7 million, or 59%, from December 31, 2018. We ended the first quarter of 2019 with $1.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $0.5 million was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.

  ●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $0.9 million, or 21%, due primarily to the payment of 2017 annual bonuses in March 2018.      
As of March 31, 2019, borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million. 
In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board’s approval each quarter. Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017. Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $0.7 million or $0.09 per share in the first quarter of both 2019 and 2018. On April 30, 2019 our Board of Directors approved the second quarter 2019 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about June 14, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2019. We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million in cash dividends to our common shareholders during 2019. 
On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”). Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time. We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repurchased no shares of our common stock. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased 122,780 shares of our common stock for approximately $1.6 million at an average price per share of $12.72.  
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, and dividend payments, and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.
