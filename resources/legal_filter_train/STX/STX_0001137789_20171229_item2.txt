      Our Company.
Overview of our business.
Highlights of events in the December 2017 quarter that impacted our financial position.
An analysis of our financial results comparing the December 2017 quarter to the September 2017 quarter and the December 2016 quarter.
An analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition including the credit quality of our investment portfolio and potential sources of liquidity.
Overview of contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments outstanding as of December 29, 2017.
We are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions.
Our principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs.
In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSD) and their related controllers, solid state hybrid drives (SSHD) and storage subsystems.
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces.
Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness.
Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data with most SSDs using NAND-based flash memory.
Our cloud systems and solutions extend innovation from the device into the information infrastructure, onsite and in the cloud.
Our portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.
During the December 2017 quarter, we shipped 88 exabytes of HDD storage capacity, generating revenue of approximately $2.9 billion and gross margin of 30%.
Our operating cash flow was $850 million.
We repurchased 5 million of our ordinary shares for $195 million, paid $182 million in dividends, as well as paid $130 million for the repurchase of certain of our outstanding debt.
Compared to the December 2016 quarter, revenue in the December 2017 quarter increased modestly primarily due to increase in exabytes shipped, offset by price erosion.
Revenue for the six months ended December 2017 quarter decreased by $145 million from the six months ended December 2016 quarter as a result of price erosion, partially offset by an improved product mix.
We maintain various sales programs such as channel rebates and price masking.
Sales programs were approximately 12%, 11% and 11% of gross drive revenue for the December 2017 quarter, September 2017 quarter and December 2016 quarter, respectively.
Adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1% of quarterly gross revenue in all periods presented.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the December 2017 quarter increased by 200 basis points from the September 2017 quarter primarily driven by favorable product mix and improved absorption of factories due to higher demand for the Companys high capacity HDD product portfolio, partially offset by price erosion.
Compared to the corresponding three and six months ended December 2016 quarter, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the three and six months ended December 2017 quarter decreased by 100 basis points in both periods, primarily driven by price erosion, partially offset by favorable product mix and improved factory utilization resulting from cost savings due to our workforce reductions and manufacturing consolidation activities.
In the December 2017 quarter, total warranty cost was within the historical range of 1% to 1.5% of revenue and included a favorable change in estimates of prior warranty accruals of less than 0.2% of revenue.
Warranty cost related to new shipments was 1.4%, 1.3%, and 1.2% of revenue for each of the December 2017, September 2017 and December 2016 quarters, respectively.
Product development expense.
Product development expense for the December 2017 quarter decreased by $13 million from the September 2017 quarter primarily due to a $4 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $13 million decrease due to related operational efficiencies, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense.
Compared to the December 2016 quarter, product development expense decreased by $55 million primarily due to a $17 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $25 million decrease due to related operational efficiencies and a $13 million decrease in variable compensation and share-based compensation expenses.
Compared to corresponding six months ended December 2016 quarter, product development expense decreased by $107 million primarily due to a $47 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $36 million decrease due to related operational efficiencies and a $24 million decrease in variable compensation and share-based compensation expenses.
Marketing and administrative expense.
Marketing and administrative expense for the December 2017 quarter decreased by $3 million from the September 2017 quarter primarily due to a decrease in salaries and related benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense.
Compared to the December 2016 quarter, Marketing and administrative expense decreased by $13 million, primarily due to a $9 million decrease in salaries and related benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, and a $4 million decrease in variable compensation expense.
Compared to corresponding six months ended December 2016 quarter, marketing and administrative expense decreased by $21 million primarily due to a $13 million decrease in salaries and related benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods and a $8 million decrease in variable compensation expense.
Restructuring and other, net.
Restructuring and other, net for the three and six months ended December 2017 quarter was comprised of restructuring charges to reduce our global workforce by 500 and 1100 employees, respectively.
Restructuring and other, net for the three and six months ended December 2016 quarter was primarily comprised of restructuring charges to reduce our global workforce by 6,500 employees.
Each of these restructuring activities have reduced our workforce as we continue to consolidate our global footprint across Asia, EMEA and the Americas.
Restructuring and Exit Costs for more details.
Other expense, net decreased by $5 million from the September 2017 quarter primarily due to a favorable $9 million change in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a $2 million loss on repurchase of debt in the December 2017 quarter.
Compared to December 2016 quarter, Other expense, net increased by $2 million in the December 2017 quarter primarily due to a $16 million of unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates and a $10 million increase in interest expense on the issuance of $750 million of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2022 and $500 million of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2024 in the quarter ended March 31, 2017, offset by the absence of a $25 million charge related to the impairment of a strategic investment in the December 2016 quarter.
Other expense, net for the six months ended December 2017 quarter increased by $20 million from the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to a $22 million increase in interest expense on the issuance of $750 million of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2022 and $500 million of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2024, a $26 million unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates, offset by the absence of a $25 million charge related to the impairment of a strategic investment in the December 2016 quarter.
We recorded income tax provisions of $212 million and $219 million in the three and six months ended December 2017 quarter, respectively.
During the six months ended December 2017 quarter, our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties increased by approximately $1 million to $75 million.
During the twelve months beginning December 30, 2017, we expect that our unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately $2 million, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.
However, these assessments are based on preliminary review and analysis of the Act and are subject to change as we continue to evaluate these highly complex rules as additional interpretive guidance is issued.
This provisional tax expense increased our effective tax rate for the three months ended December 29, 2017 to approximately 56%.
Our cash and cash equivalents increased from June 30, 2017 as a result of an increase in the net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by net cash outflows for dividends paid to our shareholders, repurchase of our ordinary shares, capital expenditures, and repayments of long-term debt.
      a decrease of $42 million in vendor receivables, primarily due to timing of receipt of vendor payments.
Cash used for investing activities for the six months ended December 29, 2017 was $210 million, which was primarily attributable to the payments for the purchase of property, equipment and leasehold improvements of $201 million.
      $35 million in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock plans.
The line of credit is available for borrowings, subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing.
Our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital, product development and capital expenditure needs, to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and to fund our quarterly dividend.
For fiscal year 2018, we expect capital expenditures to be less than 5% of revenue.
From time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding notes in open market or privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, or may repurchase outstanding notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture.
Dividends declared in the December 2017 quarter of $179 million were subsequently paid on January 3, 2018.
The Companys Board of Directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.63 per share on January 29, 2018, which is payable on April 4, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 21, 2018.
As of December 29, 2017, $0.9 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit.
All repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
 (1) Includes total future minimum rent expense under non-cancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities (rent expense is shown net of sublease income).
 (2) Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services, which are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specify all significant terms.
 (3) Consists of funding requirements related to strategic commitments.
On September 28, 2017, we entered into an Equity Commitment Letter (ECL) with a consortium of investors led by Bain Capital Private Equity for the acquisition of Toshiba Memory Corporation (TMC).
The ECL contemplates that, upon the closing of the acquisition, we would purchase up to JPY 139.5 billion (approximately USD 1.24 billion based on an exchange rate as of December 29, 2017), of a newly issued non-convertible preferred equity security of a newly formed company, K. K. Pangea, for the purpose of acquiring TMC.
The closing of the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.
As of December 29, 2017, we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling $11 million, none of which is expected to be settled within one year.
Outside of one year, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.
