Seagate Technology plc (the Company) is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions.
In addition to HDDs, the Company produces a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSDs) and storage subsystems.
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces.
Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness.
Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.
The Companys enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the cloud systems and solutions) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturers (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.
The Companys unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.
Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.
The Companys consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2018, are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 3, 2018.
The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30.
Both the three months ended September 28, 2018 and the three months ended September 29, 2017 consisted of 13 weeks.
Fiscal year 2019, which ends on June 28, 2019, and fiscal year 2018, which ended on June 29, 2018, are both comprised of 52 weeks.
The fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2018, June 29, 2018, and September 29, 2017, are also referred to herein as the September 2018 quarter , the June 2018 quarter and the September 2017 quarter, respectively.
The Company records estimated variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition as a reduction to net revenue.
For OEM sales, rebates are typically established by estimating the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received based on an OEM customers volume of purchases from Seagate or other agreed upon rebate programs.
The Company elected a practical expedient to expense sales commissions when the commissions are incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.
In February 2016 and July 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-02 (ASC Topic 842), Leases ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, and Leases, ASU 2018-11, Leases (ASC Topic 842), Target improvements, respectively.
These ASUs amend a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments.
The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of these ASUs on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 (ASC Subtopic 350-40), Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software - Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract.
This ASU aligns the accounting for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.
The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and FASB also issued certain interpretive clarifications on this new guidance which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the revenue recognition guidance under ASC 605.
The Company has completed the adoption and implemented policies, processes and controls to support the new standards measurement and disclosure requirements.
The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements for the September 2018 quarter was not material.
As of September 28, 2018, the Companys Other current assets included $3 million in restricted cash and investments held as collateral at banks for various performance obligations.

Additionally, the debt security has a contractual payment-in-kind (PIK) income which will be paid in cash upon redemption of the investment.
PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into Interest income in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and added to the carrying value of the Investment in debt security on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For the three months ended September 28, 2018, the PIK income earned was $16 million.
No impairment was identified as of September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018.

For fiscal year 2019, the Company has included these effects of the Tax Act in its financial statements and concluded the impact will not be material.
Other intangible assets consist primarily of existing technology, customer relationships and trade names acquired in business combinations.
Intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives of the assets.
Amortization is charged to Operating expenses in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Companys significant restructuring plans are described below.
December 2017 Plan  On December 8, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the December 2017 Plan) to reduce its cost structure.
The December 2017 Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2018.
July 2017 Plan  On July 25, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the July 2017 Plan) to reduce its cost structure.
The July 2017 Plan included reducing the Companys global headcount by approximately 600 employees.
March 2017 Plan  On March 9, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the March 2017 Plan) in connection with the continued consolidation of its global footprint.
The Company closed its design center in Korea, resulting in the reduction of the Companys headcount by approximately 300 employees.
The March 2017 Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2017.
July 2016 Plan  On July 11, 2016, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the July 2016 Plan) for continued consolidation of its global footprint across Asia, EMEA and the Americas.
The July 2016 Plan included reducing worldwide headcount by approximately 6,500 employees.
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and to a lesser extent, equity market risks relating to its ongoing business operations.
From time to time, the Company enters into cash flow hedges in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk on forecasted expenses and investments denominated in foreign currencies.
The Company records all derivatives in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
The changes in the fair value of highly effective designated cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
 Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments or are not assessed to be highly effective are adjusted to fair value through earnings.
The amount of net unrealized gain on cash flow hedges was $2 million as of September 28, 2018 and less than $1 million as of June 29, 2018.
The Company did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the three months ended September 29, 2017.
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts that the Company uses to hedge the foreign currency exposure on the investment in debt security and forecasted expenditures denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar.
The following tables show the total notional value of the Companys outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018.
The Company is subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by its employees as part of its Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Planthe Seagate Deferred Compensation Plan (the SDCP).
In fiscal year 2014, the Company entered into a Total Return Swap (TRS) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities.
The Company pays a floating rate, based on LIBOR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS.
The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees.
The contract term of the TRS is through January 2019 and is settled on a monthly basis, therefore limiting counterparty performance risk.
Rather, the Company records all changes in the fair value of the TRS to earnings to offset the market value changes of the SDCP liabilities.
As of September 29, 2017, the Company had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the gross fair value of the TRS reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was immaterial.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Level 3  Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
Where appropriate the Companys or the counterpartys non-performance risk is considered in determining the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.
The Company classifies items in Level 1 if the financial assets consist of securities for which quoted prices are available in an active market.
 The Company uses a pricing service to assist in determining the fair value of all of its cash equivalents and short-term investments.
For the cash equivalents and short-term investments in the Companys portfolio, multiple pricing sources are generally available.
The Company corroborates the prices obtained from the pricing service against other independent sources and, as of September 28, 2018, has not found it necessary to make any adjustments to the prices obtained.
The Companys derivative financial instruments are also classified within Level 2.
The Companys derivative financial instruments consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the TRS.
The Company determines the fair value of these instruments by considering the estimated amount it would pay or receive to terminate these agreements at the reporting date.
As of September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the Company had no Level 3 assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
As of September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the carrying value of the Companys strategic investments were $107 million and $118 million, respectively.
For the three months ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017, the Company did not have any equity investments accounted for under the cost method that were other-than-temporarily impaired and did not record any impairment charges.
As of September 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the Company had $26 million of held for sale land and building (collectively, the property) in Asia included in Other current assets on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The respective property to be sold met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at the end of fiscal year 2017.
During the September 2018 quarter, the Company accepted an offer to sell the property to a third party.
The sale is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2019, subject to government approval and customary closing conditions.
No impairment was identified for the three months ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017.
This debt security has a maturity date of six years starting from May 31, 2018 and is classified as Investment in debt security on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The debt security is recorded at amortized cost and its fair value approximated the carrying value at June 29, 2018.
As of September 28, 2018, the fair value of this investment was $1,289 million with an unrealized gain of $30 million on the carrying value of $1,259 million.
The Companys authorized share capital is $13,500 and consists of 1,250,000,000 ordinary shares, par value $0.00001, of which 286,127,032 shares were outstanding as of September 28, 2018, and 100,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.00001, of which none were issued or outstanding as of September 28, 2018.

Holders of shares are entitled to one vote per share on all matters upon which the ordinary shares are entitled to vote, including the election of directors.
Preferred shares  The Company may issue preferred shares in one or more series, up to the authorized amount, without shareholder approval.
The Board of Directors is authorized to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions.
The Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the shareholders.

The Company has been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites.
At each of these sites, the Company has an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties.
