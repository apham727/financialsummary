Interest Rate Risk.
As of October 4, 2019, we had no available-for-sale debt securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months.
We determined no available-for-sale debt securities were other-than-temporarily impaired as of October 4, 2019.
In the September 2019 quarter, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $500 million to convert the variable interest rate on the Term Loan to fixed interest rates.
The contracts were effective as of October 4, 2019 and will mature on September 16, 2025.
The objective of the interest rate swap agreements is to eliminate the variability of interest payment cash flows associated with variable interest rates.
We have fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations.
Our Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a variable margin set on September 19, 2019.
The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of October 4, 2019.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.
From time to time, we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures.
At this time, we have not identified any material exposure associated with the potential changes related to the British vote to exit the European Union.
We did not have any material net gains or losses recognized in Cost of revenue, or Other, net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness or discontinued cash flow hedges during the three months ended October 4, 2019.
The table below provides information as of October 4, 2019 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
The table is provided in U.S. dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts (at the contract exchange rates) and the weighted-average contractual foreign currency exchange rates.
Other Market Risks.
We have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio.
We also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty, and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institution.
Additionally, the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk.
In fiscal year 2014, we entered into a TRS in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities.
We pay a floating rate, based on LIBOR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS.
The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees.
