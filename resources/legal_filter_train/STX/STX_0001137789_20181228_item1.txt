Seagate Technology plc (the Company) is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions.
In addition to HDDs, the Company produces a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSDs) and storage subsystems.
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces.
Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness.
Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.
The Companys enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the cloud systems and solutions) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturers (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.
The Companys unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.
Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.
The Companys consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2018, are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 3, 2018.
The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30.
Fiscal year 2019, which ends on June 28, 2019, and fiscal year 2018, which ended on June 29, 2018, are both comprised of 52 weeks.
The fiscal quarters ended December 28, 2018, September 28, 2018, and December 29, 2017, are also referred to herein as the December 2018 quarter, the September 2018 quarter and the December 2017 quarter, respectively.
The Company records estimated variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition as a reduction to net revenue.
For OEM sales, rebates are typically established by estimating the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received based on an OEM customers volume of purchases from Seagate or other agreed upon rebate programs.
The Company elected a practical expedient to expense sales commissions when the commissions are incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.
In February 2016 and July 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-02 (ASC Topic 842), Leases ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, and Leases, ASU 2018-11, Leases (ASC Topic 842), Target Improvements, respectively.
These ASUs amend a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments.
The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of these ASUs on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 (ASC Subtopic 350-40), Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software - Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract.
This ASU aligns the accounting for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.
The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and FASB also issued certain interpretive clarifications on this new guidance which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the revenue recognition guidance under ASC 605.
The Company has completed the adoption and implemented policies, processes and controls to support the new standards measurement and disclosure requirements.
The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended December 28, 2018 was not material.
As of December 28, 2018, the Company had no material available-for-sale debt securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months.
The Company determined no available-for-sale debt securities were other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 28, 2018.
As of June 29, 2018, the Company had no material available-for-sale securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months.

As of December 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion investment in non-convertible preferred stock of Toshiba Memory Corporation (TMC, formerly known as K.K.
The investment, with a contractual maturity of six years starting from May 31, 2018, is accounted for as a held-to-maturity debt security, carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of transaction costs into interest income.
Additionally, the debt security has a contractual payment-in-kind (PIK) income which will be paid in cash upon redemption of the investment.
PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into Interest income in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and added to the carrying value of the Investment in debt security on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For the three and six months ended December 28, 2018, the PIK income earned was $15 million and $31 million, respectively.
The loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a variable margin that will be determined based on the corporate credit rating of the Company.
The Revolving Credit Facility is available for cash borrowings, subject to compliance with certain covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing, and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sub-limit of $75 million.
As of December 28, 2018, no borrowings had been drawn or letters of credit utilized under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of existing technology, customer relationships and trade names acquired in business combinations.
Intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives of the assets.
Amortization is charged to Operating expenses in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Companys significant restructuring plans are described below.
December 2017 Plan  On December 8, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the December 2017 Plan) to reduce its cost structure.
The December 2017 Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2018.
July 2017 Plan  On July 25, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the July 2017 Plan) to reduce its cost structure.
The July 2017 Plan included reducing the Companys global headcount by approximately 600 employees.
March 2017 Plan  On March 9, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the March 2017 Plan) in connection with the continued consolidation of its global footprint.
The Company closed its design center in Korea, resulting in the reduction of the Companys headcount by approximately 300 employees.
The March 2017 Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2017.
July 2016 Plan  On July 11, 2016, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the July 2016 Plan) for continued consolidation of its global footprint across Asia, EMEA and the Americas.
The July 2016 Plan included reducing worldwide headcount by approximately 6,500 employees.
Additionally, during the December 2018 quarter, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $2 million on its held for sale land and building, which is included in Restructuring and other, net in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and to a lesser extent, equity market risks relating to its ongoing business operations.
From time to time, the Company enters into cash flow hedges in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk on forecasted expenses and investments denominated in foreign currencies.
The Companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are classified as designated or non-designated hedging instruments.
The Company records all derivatives in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
The changes in the fair value of highly effective designated cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments or are not assessed to be highly effective are adjusted to fair value through earnings.
The amount of net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges was $3 million as of December 28, 2018 and the amount of net unrealized gain on cash flow hedges was less than $1 million as of June 29, 2018.
The Company did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the three and six months ended December 29, 2017.
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts that the Company uses to hedge the foreign currency exposure on the investment in debt security and forecasted expenditures denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar.
The Company is subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by its employees as part of its Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Planthe Seagate Deferred Compensation Plan (the SDCP).
In fiscal year 2014, the Company entered into a Total Return Swap (TRS) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities.
The Company pays a floating rate, based on LIBOR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS.
The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees.
The contract term of the TRS was through January 2020 and is settled on a monthly basis, therefore limiting counterparty performance risk.
Rather, the Company records all changes in the fair value of the TRS to earnings to offset the market value changes of the SDCP liabilities.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Level 3  Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
Where appropriate the Companys or the counterpartys non-performance risk is considered in determining the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.
The Company classifies items in Level 1 if the financial assets consist of securities for which quoted prices are available in an active market.
As of December 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the Company had no Level 3 assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
As of December 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the carrying value of the Companys strategic investments were $111 million and $118 million, respectively.
For the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, the Company did not have any equity investments accounted for under the cost method that were other-than-temporarily impaired and did not record any impairment charges.
For the three and six months ended December 28, 2018, there were no upward or downward adjustments on equity investments as a result of adoption of the measurement alternative during the September 2018 quarter.
As of December 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the Company had $24 million and $26 million, respectively, of held for sale land and building (collectively, the property) in Asia included in Other current assets on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The respective property to be sold met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at the end of fiscal year 2017.
During the September 2018 quarter, the Company accepted an offer to sell the property to a third party and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $2 million during the three and six months ended December 28, 2018.
The sale is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2019, subject to government approval and customary closing conditions.
This debt security has a maturity date of six years starting from May 31, 2018 and is classified as Investment in debt security on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The debt security is recorded at amortized cost and its fair value approximated the carrying value at June 29, 2018.
As of December 28, 2018, the fair value of this investment was $1,272 million with an unrealized loss of $28 million on the carrying value of $1,300 million.

The Revised Indemnification Agreement provides indemnification in addition to any of Indemnitees indemnification rights under Seagate-Caymans Articles of Association, applicable law or otherwise, and indemnifies an Indemnitee for certain expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in the right of Seagate-Cayman or any of its subsidiaries, arising out of his or her service as a director, officer, employee or agent of Seagate-Cayman or any of its subsidiaries or of any other entity to which he or she provides services at Seagate-Caymans request.
However, an Indemnitee shall not be indemnified under the Revised Indemnification Agreement for (i) any fraud or dishonesty in the performance of Indemnitees duty to Seagate-Cayman or the applicable subsidiary of Seagate-Cayman or (ii) Indemnitees conscious, intentional or willful failure to act honestly, lawfully and in good faith with a view to the best interests of Seagate-Cayman or the applicable subsidiary of Seagate-Cayman.
In addition, the Revised Indemnification Agreement provides that Seagate-Cayman will advance expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with enforcement of the Revised Indemnification Agreement or with the investigation, settlement or appeal of any action or proceeding against him or her as to which he or she could be indemnified.
On July 3, 2010, pursuant to a corporate reorganization, the common shareholders of Seagate-Cayman became ordinary shareholders of the Company and Seagate-Cayman became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as described more fully in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on July 6, 2010 (the Redomestication).
On July 27, 2010, in connection with the Redomestication, the Company, as sole shareholder of Seagate-Cayman, approved a form of deed of indemnity (the Deed of Indemnity), which provides for the indemnification by Seagate-Cayman of any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, Seagate-Cayman or any subsidiary of the Company (each, a Deed Indemnitee), in addition to any indemnification rights of a Deed Indemnitee under the Companys Articles of Association, applicable law or otherwise, with a similar scope to the Revised Indemnification Agreement.
Seagate-Cayman entered into Deeds of Indemnity with certain Deed Indemnitees effective as of July 3, 2010 and continues to enter into Deeds of Indemnity with additional Deed Indemnitees from time to time.

The Companys operations are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
Some of the Companys operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities.
The Company has established environmental management systems and continually updates its environmental policies and standard operating procedures for its operations worldwide.
The Company believes that its operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits.
Some environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the Superfund law) and its state equivalents, can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites, regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity.
The Company has been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites.
At each of these sites, the Company has an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties.
The Company has fulfilled its responsibilities at some of these sites and remains involved in only a few at this time.
The Company is involved in a number of other judicial, regulatory or administrative proceedings and investigations incidental to its business, and the Company may be involved in such proceedings and investigations arising in the normal course of its business in the future.
The Company expects the commitment to total $4 million, $50 million, $48 million, $47 million and $28 million for fiscal years 2021, 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively with no remaining commitment thereafter.
