Seagate Technology plc (the Company) is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions.
In addition to HDDs, the Company produces a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSD) and their related controllers, solid state hybrid drives (SSHD) and storage subsystems.
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces.
Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness.
Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data with most SSDs using NAND-based flash memory.
The Companys cloud systems and solutions extend innovation from the device into the information infrastructure, onsite and in the cloud.
Its portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturers (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.
Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.
Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.
The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 4, 2017.
The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30.
Fiscal year 2018 will be comprised of 52 weeks and will end on June 29, 2018.
The fiscal quarters ended December 29, 2017, September 29, 2017, and December 30, 2016, are also referred to herein as the December 2017 quarter, the September 2017 quarter, and the December 2016 quarter, respectively.
There have been no significant changes in the Companys significant accounting policies.
In May 2014, August 2015, April 2016, May 2016 and December 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASU 2015-14 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date, ASU 2016-10 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, and ASU 2016-20 (ASC Topic 606) Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, respectively.
ASC Topic 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
Based on its assessment, the Company plans to adopt the new revenue standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition.
Accordingly, the Company will need to estimate variable consideration (e.g.
rebates) related to customer incentives on these arrangements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 (ASC Subtopic 825-10), Financial InstrumentsOverall Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
The amendments in this ASU require entities to measure all investments in equity securities at fair value with changes recognized through net income.
This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting, to those that result in consolidation of the investee, or for which the entity meets a practicability exception to fair value measurement.
Additionally, the amendments eliminate certain disclosure requirements related to financial instruments measured at amortized cost and add disclosures related to the measurement categories of financial assets and financial liabilities.
Early adoption is permitted for only certain portions of the ASU.
The Company expects to elect the measurement alternative for measurement of equity investments, defined as cost, less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the Price Changes) until the equity investments fair value becomes readily determinable.
The amount of the impact to equity investments will depend on any Price Changes observed after adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The ASU amends a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments.
The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
Upon adoption, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based award activity are reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes, whereas they previously were recognized in the Shareholders equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company also elected to continue to account for share-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures.
The adoption of this guidance had no material impact on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
As of December 29, 2017, the Company had no material available-for-sale securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months.
The Company determined that no available-for-sale securities were other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 29, 2017.
As of June 30, 2017, the Company had no material available-for-sale securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months.
The Company determined no available-for-sale securities were other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2017.
The term of the Revolving Credit Facility is through January 15, 2020, provided that if the Company does not have Investment Grade Ratings (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) on August 15, 2018, then the maturity date will be August 16, 2018 unless certain extension conditions have been satisfied.
The loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a variable margin that will be determined based on the corporate credit rating of the Company.
The Revolving Credit Facility is available for cash borrowings, subject to compliance with certain covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing, and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sub-limit of $75 million.

Intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives of the assets.
Amortization is charged to Operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Companys significant restructuring plans are described below.
December 2017 Plan - On December 8, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the December 2017 Plan) to reduce its cost structure.
The December 2017 Plan is expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2018.
July 2017 Plan - On July 25, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the July 2017 Plan) to reduce its cost structure.
The July 2017 Plan included reducing the Companys global headcount by approximately 600 employees.
March 2017 Plan - On March 9, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the March 2017 Plan) in connection with the continued consolidation of its global footprint.
The Company closed its design center in Korea, resulting in the reduction of the Companys headcount by approximately 300 employees.
The March 2017 Plan was largely completed by the end of fiscal year 2017.
July 2016 Plan - On July 11, 2016, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the July 2016 Plan) for continued consolidation of its global footprint across Asia, EMEA and the Americas.
The July 2016 Plan included reducing worldwide headcount by approximately 6,500 employees.
In addition, during fiscal year 2017, the Company committed to sell certain land and buildings primarily in Asia as part of the March 2017 and July 2016 plans, which accordingly met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale and were reclassified to Other current assets at that time.
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and to a lesser extent, equity market risks relating to its ongoing business operations.
The Company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk on forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies.
The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
The changes in the fair value of the effective portions of designated cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings.
The Company had no outstanding cash flow hedges as of December 29, 2017 and June 30, 2017.
The Company dedesignates its cash flow hedges when the forecasted hedged transactions are realized or it is probable the forecasted hedged transactions will not occur in the initially identified time period.
The Company did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the three and six months ended December 29, 2017.
As of December 29, 2017 and June 30, 2017, the Company does not have outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
The Company is subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by its employees as part of its Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Planthe Seagate Deferred Compensation Plan (the SDCP).
In fiscal year 2014, the Company entered into a Total Return Swap (TRS) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities.
The Company pays a floating rate, based on LIBOR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS.
The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees.
As of December 29, 2017, the notional investments underlying the TRS amounted to $117 million.
The contract term of the TRS is through January 2019 and is settled on a monthly basis, therefore limiting counterparty performance risk.
Rather, the Company records all changes in the fair value of the TRS to earnings to offset the market value changes of the SDCP liabilities.
 (a) The amount of gain or (loss) recognized in income related to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationships and the amount excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were less than $1 million for the three and six months ended December 30, 2016.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Level 3  Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
Where appropriate the Companys or the counterpartys non-performance risk is considered in determining the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.
The Company classifies items in Level 1 if the financial assets consist of securities for which quoted prices are available in an active market.
As of December 29, 2017 and June 30, 2017, the Company had no Level 3 assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
The carrying value of the Companys strategic investments at December 29, 2017 and June 30, 2017 totaled $129 million and $125 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of privately held equity securities without a readily determinable fair value.
For the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, the Company did not have any equity investments accounted for under the cost method that were other-than-temporarily impaired and did not record any impairment charges.
For the six months ended December 30, 2016, the Company determined that a certain equity investment accounted for under the cost method was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recognized a charge of $25 million in order to write down the carrying amount of the investment to zero.
The Company did not record any impairment charges in the three months ended December 30, 2016.
As of December 29, 2017 and June 30, 2017, the Company had $77 million held for sale assets included in Other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which primarily consisted of $37 million of land and building in Korea and $26 million of land and building in China, with the remainder of the balance comprised of property at other locations (collectively, the properties).
The respective properties to be sold met the criteria to be classified as held for sale during the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017.
Depreciation related to the properties ceased as of the date these were determined to be held for sale.
During fiscal year 2017, the Company recorded impairment charges of $35 million to write down the carrying amount of such properties to their estimated fair values less costs to sell.
The impairment charges were recorded in Operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
No additional impairment charges related to these properties were recorded during the three and six months period ended December 29, 2017.
The fair values were measured with the assistance of third-party valuation models which used inputs such as comparable market data for similar land sale transactions adjusted for differences in comparable properties to derive the estimated fair value of the subject properties and the cost approach valuation techniques for buildings as part of the analysis.
The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3 as significant unobservable inputs were used in the valuation analysis.
The Companys authorized share capital is $13,500 and consists of 1,250,000,000 ordinary shares, par value $0.00001, of which 284,573,784 shares were outstanding as of December 29, 2017, and 100,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.00001, of which none were issued or outstanding as of December 29, 2017.
