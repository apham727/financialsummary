After record bookings throughout 2018, the Company has experienced slower bookings during the first nine months of 2019 as customers work through their inventory on hand.
The Company has also experienced margin pressure throughout 2019 due to lower sales volumes and high material costs from 2018 which continue to run through the Company’s statement of operations.
As a result of these ongoing factors, the Company expects the balance of 2019 to remain challenging from both a sales and margin perspective.
