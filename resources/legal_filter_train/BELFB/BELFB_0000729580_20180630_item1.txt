In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented have been made.
These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Bel Fuse Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The Company's significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2018, except as discussed in Note 2, Revenue, related to the adoption of the new revenue standards.
All amounts included in the tables to these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, except per share amounts, are in thousands.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09"), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.
Subsequently, the FASB issued several other updates related to revenue recognition (collectively with ASU 2014-09, the "new revenue standards" or "ASC 606").
Upon adoption, the new revenue standards replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
In connection with the modified retrospective application of the new revenue standards, we recorded an adjustment to increase retained earnings of $3.4 million upon the January 1, 2018 adoption date.
Apart from this adjustment and the inclusion of additional required disclosures in Note 2, the adoption of the new revenue standards did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.
Under this guidance, lessees and lessors should apply a "right-of-use" model in accounting for all leases (including subleases) and eliminate the concept of operating leases and off-balance sheet leases.
Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease.
Similar modifications have been made to lessor accounting in-line with revenue recognition guidance.
The amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements.
We are currently in the process of evaluating this new standard update.
Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under ASC 605.
In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services.
The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services.
Our revenues are substantially derived from sales of our products.
In our power solutions and protection group, we provide intelligent, efficient and reliable AC-DC and DC-DC power conversion devices and circuit protection products.
Applications range from board-mount power to system-level architectures for servers, storage, networking, industrial and transportation.
In our magnetic solutions group, we provide an extensive line of integrated connector modules (ICM), where an Ethernet magnetic solution is integrated into a connector package.
Products within the Company's magnetic solutions group are primarily used in networking and industrial applications.
The Company also provides incremental services to our customers in the form of training, technical support, special tooling, and other support as deemed necessary from time to time.
For purposes of ASC 606, all such incremental services were concluded to be immaterial in the context of the contracts.
Warranties generally extend for one to three years from the date of sale, providing customers with assurance that the related product will function as intended.
Actual warranty repair costs are charged against the reserve balance as incurred.
See Note 11, "Accrued Expenses."
We estimate product returns, including product exchanges under warranty, based on historical experience.
In general, the Company is not contractually obligated to accept returns except for defective product or in instances where the product does not meet the Company's product specifications.
However, the Company may permit its customers to return product for other reasons.
In certain instances, the Company would generally require a significant cancellation penalty payment by the customer.
The Company estimates such returns, where applicable, based upon management's evaluation of historical experience, market acceptance of products produced and known negotiations with customers.
Contracts with customers indicate the general terms and conditions in which business will be conducted for a set period of time.
Payment for products sold under direct contracts with customers or contracts with distributors is typically due in full within 30-90 days from the transfer of title to customer.
Payment for products sold under consignment contracts is typically due within 60 days of the customer pulling the product from the hub.
Payment due related to our licensing agreements is generally within 30 days of receiving the licensee sales data, which is either on a quarterly or annual basis.
However, the "ship and debit" arrangements with distributors, royalty income associated with our licensing agreements, and the product returns described above are each deemed to be variable consideration which requires the Company to make constrained estimates based on historical data.
A contract asset results when goods or services have been transferred to the customer but payment is contingent upon a future event, other than passage of time.
In the case of our consignment arrangements, we are unable to invoice the customer until product is pulled from the hub by the customer, which generates an unbilled receivable (a contract asset) when revenue is initially recognized.
A contract liability results when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance obligation being met.
We have certain customers who provide payment in advance of product being shipped, which results in deferred revenue (a contract liability).
The change in balance of our unbilled receivables from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 primarily relates to a timing difference between the Company's performance (i.e.
when our product is shipped to a customer-controlled hub) and the point at which the Company can invoice the customer per the terms of the customer contract (i.e.
when the customer pulls our product from the customer-controlled hub).
The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of June 30, 2018 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $18.3 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2019 - 2024.
It is expected that 20% of this aggregate amount will be recognized in 2019, 63% will be recognized in 2020 and the remainder will be recognized in years beyond 2020.
The majority of the Company's total backlog of orders at June 30, 2018 is related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, for which the Company is electing to utilize the practical expedient available within the guidance, and are excluded from the transaction price related to these future obligations.
The Company will generally satisfy the remaining performance obligations as we transfer control of the products ordered to our customers.
The transaction price related to these future obligations also excludes variable consideration consisting of sales or usage-based royalties earned on licensing agreements.
Level 3 â€“ Unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company held certain financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
These consisted of securities that are among the Company's investments in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") obligations.
The gross unrealized gains associated with the investment securities held in the rabbi trust were $0.2 million at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
Such unrealized gains are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our available-for-sale securities, which primarily consist of investments held in a rabbi trust of $1.5 million at each date, are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs.
The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the six months ended June 30, 2018 or June 30, 2017.
There were no changes to the Company's valuation techniques used to measure asset fair values on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
The Company has other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature.
The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities.
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of total debt was $117.9 million and $124.8 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $115.5 million and $122.7 million, respectively.
The Company did not have any other financial liabilities within the scope of the fair value disclosure requirements as of June 30, 2018.
Nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, are accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
These items are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event or in the case of goodwill, on at least an annual basis.
There were no triggering events that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2018 that would warrant interim impairment testing.
Depreciation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 was $2.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively.
Depreciation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 was $6.1 million and $7.0 million, respectively.
The CSA consists of (i) a term loan, with outstanding borrowings of $117.5 million and $125.0 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively and (ii) a $75 million revolving credit facility ("Revolver"), with no outstanding borrowings at June 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
The CSA has a maturity date of December 11, 2022.
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet is reflected net of $2.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of deferred financing costs.
Per the terms of the CSA, such voluntary prepayments reduce the amount of future scheduled payments on a pro rata basis.
The weighted-average interest rate in effect was 4.13% at June 30, 2018 and 3.38% at December 31, 2017 and consisted of LIBOR plus the Company's credit spread, as determined per the terms of the CSA.
The Company incurred $1.3 million and $1.6 million of interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, and $2.5 million and $3.0 million of interest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.
The CSA contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA, as defined, ("Leverage Ratio") and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA to the Company's consolidated fixed charges.
If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the CSA would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.
At June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.
The Company's liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaled $29.8 million and $30.4 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, of which $1.4 million and $2.5 million is included in other current liabilities at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
These amounts, if recognized, would reduce the Company's effective tax rate.
As of June 30, 2018, approximately $1.4 million of the Company's liabilities for uncertain tax positions are expected to be resolved during 2018 by way of expiration of the related statute of limitations.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in interest and penalties in the consolidated statements of operations.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized a benefit of $0.4 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, for the reversal of such interest and penalties, relating to the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlement of the acquired liability for uncertain tax positions, respectively.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") was enacted on December 22, 2017.
The Company maintains the Bel Fuse Inc. Employees' Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan that is intended to meet the applicable requirements for tax-qualification under sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
The expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods.

The expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $0.2 million in both periods.
As of June 30, 2018, the plan owned 3,323 and 17,342 shares of Bel Fuse Inc. Class A and Class B common stock, respectively.
As discussed in Note 3 above, the Company has investments in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the obligations of the SERP.
Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component during the six months ended June 30, 2018 are as follows.
In connection with the acquisition of Power Solutions, there is an ongoing claim by the Arezzo Revenue Agency in Italy concerning certain tax matters related to what was then Power-One Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd. (now Bel Power Solutions Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd, or "BPS China") for the years 2004 to 2006.
In September 2012, the Tax Court of Arezzo ruled in favor of BPS China and cancelled the claim.
In February 2013, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal of the Tax Court's ruling.
On October 13, 2014, BPS China was informed of the Regional Tax Commission of Florence ruling which was in favor of the Arezzo Revenue Agency and against BPS China.
An appeal was filed on July 18, 2015 before the Regional Tax Commission of Florence and rejected.
The Court hearing on infringement took place on March 23, 2017.
Upon hearing argument from both parties, the Court issued a decision on April 6, 2017 staying final judgment in the infringement case pending resolution of the nullity lawsuit in the Federal Patents Courts in Munich, Germany.
The Federal Patents Courts issued its preliminary opinion regarding the patent-in-suit on March 29, 2018, stating that it considers the patent-in-suit to not be novel over the prior art documents presented in the case.
The parties agreed to withdraw from the pending infringement and nullity proceedings and entered into a settlement agreement on June 29, 2018.
The Company paid Setec 75,000 Euro in exchange for a perpetual, worldwide royalty-free license to the patent-in-suit and all its counterparts.
In 2015, one of the Company's subsidiaries in the PRC, Dongguan Transpower Electric Products Co., Ltd. ("Dongguan Transpower"), was provided notice of a claim by DG Yu Shing Industrial Development Company Limited against Dongguan Transpower and three other defendants for past due construction costs of approximately $3.2 million.
In April 2018, the 3rd People Court of Dongguan ruled and provided an unfavorable judgment against Dongguan Transpower and two of the other defendants requiring payment of the aforementioned amount.
The defendants were held to be jointly and severally liable for approximately $3.2 million in costs.
Due to the fact that none of the other defendants had sufficient funds to pay the damages amount, the Court ordered the entire amount (CNY 20,133,174) to be paid by Dongguan Transpower.
On May 25, 2018, the Court enforced its order and withdrew the damages amount from Dongguan Transpower's bank accounts.
On May 31, 2018, Dongguan Transpower filed an action against the other defendants in CP Court to recoup the damages amount paid pursuant to an indemnification letter dated October 16, 2015.
The Court heard arguments on July 2, 2018 and rendered a verdict on July 9, 2018 ordering the Jinmei entities (defendants) to pay CNY 20,133,174 back to Dongguan Transpower together with the incurred interest.
The Company's balance sheet at June 30, 2018 includes an indemnification asset in the amount of $3.2 million, included in other current assets, related to this.
The Company expects that funds will be remitted by mid-August.
