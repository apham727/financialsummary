The Company's significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, except as discussed in Note 2, Revenue, related to the adoption of the new revenue standards. 
All amounts included in the tables to these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, except per share amounts, are in thousands. 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09"), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. Subsequently, the FASB issued several other updates related to revenue recognition (collectively with ASU 2014-09, the "new revenue standards" or "ASC 606"). We adopted the guidance under the new revenue standards effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings. 
In connection with the modified retrospective application of the new revenue standards, we recorded an adjustment to increase retained earnings of $3.4 million upon the January 1, 2018 adoption date. Apart from this adjustment and the inclusion of additional required disclosures in Note 2, the adoption of the new revenue standards did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.  
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to provide a new comprehensive model for lease accounting. Under this guidance, lessees and lessors should apply a "right-of-use" model in accounting for all leases (including subleases) and eliminate the concept of operating leases and off-balance sheet leases. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. Similar modifications have been made to lessor accounting in-line with revenue recognition guidance. This guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. The updated guidance requires a modified retrospective adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on January 1, 2019. We are currently assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements, which will consist primarily of recording right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to our operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet. 
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under ASC 605. The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the transfer of control of the Company's goods and services and provides financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. 
In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services. 
Our revenues are substantially derived from sales of our products. 
The Company also provides incremental services to our customers in the form of training, technical support, special tooling, and other support as deemed necessary from time to time. For purposes of ASC 606, all such incremental services were concluded to be immaterial in the context of the contracts. 
Warranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets in which the Company operates. Warranties generally extend for one to three years from the date of sale, providing customers with assurance that the related product will function as intended. The Company reviews its warranty liability quarterly based on an analysis of actual expenses and failure rates accompanied with estimated future costs and projected failure rate trends. Factors taken into consideration when evaluating our warranty reserve are (i) historical claims for each product, (ii) volume increases, (iii) life of warranty, (iv) historical warranty repair costs and (v) other factors. To the extent that actual experience differs from our estimate, the provision for product warranties will be adjusted in future periods. Actual warranty repair costs are charged against the reserve balance as incurred. See Note 7, "Accrued Expenses." 
We estimate product returns, including product exchanges under warranty, based on historical experience. In general, the Company is not contractually obligated to accept returns except for defective product or in instances where the product does not meet the Company's product specifications. However, the Company may permit its customers to return product for other reasons. In certain instances, the Company would generally require a significant cancellation penalty payment by the customer. The Company estimates such returns, where applicable, based upon management's evaluation of historical experience, market acceptance of products produced and known negotiations with customers. Such estimates are deducted from sales and provided for at the time revenue is recognized. Distribution customers often receive what is referred to as "ship and debit" arrangements, whereby Bel will invoice them at an agreed upon unit price upon shipment of product and a price reduction may be granted if the market price of the product declines after shipment. Distributors may also be entitled to special pricing discount credits, and certain customers are entitled to return allowances based on previous sales volumes. Bel deducts estimates for anticipated credits, refunds and returns from sales each quarter based on historical experience. 
Contracts with customers indicate the general terms and conditions in which business will be conducted for a set period of time. Individual purchase orders state the description, quantity and price of each product purchased. Payment for products sold under direct contracts with customers or contracts with distributors is typically due in full within 30-90 days from the transfer of title to customer. Payment for products sold under consignment contracts is typically due within 60 days of the customer pulling the product from the hub. Payment due related to our licensing agreements is generally within 30 days of receiving the licensee sales data, which is either on a quarterly or annual basis. 
Since the customer agrees to a stated price for each product on each purchase order, the majority of contracts are not subject to variable consideration. However, the "ship and debit" arrangements with distributors, royalty income associated with our licensing agreements, and the product returns described above are each deemed to be variable consideration which requires the Company to make constrained estimates based on historical data. 
A contract asset results when goods or services have been transferred to the customer but payment is contingent upon a future event, other than passage of time. In the case of our consignment arrangements, we are unable to invoice the customer until product is pulled from the hub by the customer, which generates an unbilled receivable (a contract asset) when revenue is initially recognized. 
A contract liability results when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance obligation being met. We have certain customers who provide payment in advance of product being shipped, which results in deferred revenue (a contract liability). 
The change in balance of our unbilled receivables from January 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018 primarily relates to a timing difference between the Company's performance (i.e. when our product is shipped to a customer-controlled hub) and the point at which the Company can invoice the customer per the terms of the customer contract (i.e. when the customer pulls our product from the customer-controlled hub). 
The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of September 30, 2018 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $17.6 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2019 - 2024. It is expected that 14% of this aggregate amount will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019, 52% will be recognized in 2020 and the remainder will be recognized in years beyond 2020. The majority of the Company's total backlog of orders at September 30, 2018 is related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, for which the Company is electing to utilize the practical expedient available within the guidance, and are excluded from the transaction price related to these future obligations. The Company will generally satisfy the remaining performance obligations as we transfer control of the products ordered to our customers. The transaction price related to these future obligations also excludes variable consideration consisting of sales or usage-based royalties earned on licensing agreements. The variability related to these sales or usage-based royalties will be resolved in the periods when the licensee generates sales related to the licensed intellectual property. 
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company held certain financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These consisted of securities that are among the Company's investments in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") obligations. The gross unrealized gains associated with the investment securities held in the rabbi trust were $0.2 million at December 31, 2017. Such unrealized gains are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company sold its securities and realized a gain on sale of $0.2 million. The proceeds of $1.3 million were reinvested in other securities within the rabbi trust. 
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our securities primarily consisted of investments held in a rabbi trust of $1.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, which were measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs. The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 or September 30, 2017. Excluding the changes made in accordance with the Company's adoption of ASU 2016-01, there were no additional changes to the Company's valuation techniques used to measure asset fair values on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. 
There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017. 
The Company has other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of total debt was $116.9 million and $124.8 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $114.8 million and $122.7 million, respectively. The Company did not have any other financial liabilities within the scope of the fair value disclosure requirements as of September 30, 2018. 
Nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, are accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These items are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event or in the case of goodwill, on at least an annual basis. There were no triggering events that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 that would warrant interim impairment testing. 
The CSA contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA, as defined, ("Leverage Ratio") and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA to the Company's consolidated fixed charges. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the CSA would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. 
As a result of the expiration of the statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns may change materially from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the Company's consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2018. The Company's liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaled $28.2 million and $30.4 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, of which $1.1 million and $2.5 million is included in other current liabilities at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. These amounts, if recognized, would reduce the Company's effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2018, approximately $2.5 million of the Company's liabilities for uncertain tax positions were resolved during 2018 by way of expiration of the related statute of limitations. 
The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the current provision for income taxes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in interest and penalties in the consolidated statements of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recognized a benefit of $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the reversal of such interest and penalties, relating to the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlement of the acquired liability for uncertain tax positions. There were no reversals of interest or penalties in the three or nine months ended September 30, 2017. The Company has approximately $3.1 million and $3.2 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is included in both income taxes payable and liability for uncertain tax positions in the consolidated balance sheets. 
The Company maintains the Bel Fuse Inc. Employees' Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan that is intended to meet the applicable requirements for tax-qualification under sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods. The expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The Company's matching contribution is made in the form of Bel Fuse Inc. Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2018, the plan owned 111,393 and 137,700 shares of Bel Fuse Inc. Class A and Class B common stock, respectively. 
The Company's subsidiaries in Asia have a retirement fund covering substantially all of their Hong Kong based full-time employees. The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $0.1 million in both periods. The expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods. As of September 30, 2018, the plan owned 3,323 and 17,342 shares of Bel Fuse Inc. Class A and Class B common stock, respectively. 
Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 are as follows. All amounts are net of tax. 
In connection with the acquisition of Power Solutions, there is an ongoing claim by the Arezzo Revenue Agency in Italy concerning certain tax matters related to what was then Power-One Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd. (now Bel Power Solutions Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd, or "BPS China") for the years 2004 to 2006. In September 2012, the Tax Court of Arezzo ruled in favor of BPS China and cancelled the claim. In February 2013, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal of the Tax Court's ruling. The hearing of the appeal was held on October 2, 2014. On October 13, 2014, BPS China was informed of the Regional Tax Commission of Florence ruling which was in favor of the Arezzo Revenue Agency and against BPS China. An appeal was filed on July 18, 2015 before the Regional Tax Commission of Florence and rejected. On December 5, 2016, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal with the Supreme Court and BPS China filed a counter-appeal on January 4, 2017. The Supreme Court has yet to render its judgment. The estimated liability related to this matter is approximately $12.0 million and has been included as a liability for uncertain tax positions on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As Bel is fully indemnified in this matter per the terms of the stock purchase agreement with ABB, a corresponding other asset for indemnification is also included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 
In 2015, the Company was provided notice of a potential patent infringement claim by Setec Netzwerke AG ("Setec"), a German company for the alleged infringement of their patent EP 306 934 B1. Setec subsequently filed a lawsuit against the Company and three of its subsidiaries in the Regional Court of Dusseldorf, Germany on January 29, 2016 for patent infringement. The Company filed its defense to Setec's Complaint and a nullity lawsuit against Setec's patent on August 31 2016. The Court hearing on infringement took place on March 23, 2017. Upon hearing argument from both parties, the Court issued a decision on April 6, 2017 staying final judgment in the infringement case pending resolution of the nullity lawsuit in the Federal Patents Courts in Munich, Germany. The Federal Patents Courts issued its preliminary opinion regarding the patent-in-suit on March 29, 2018, stating that it considers the patent-in-suit to not be novel over the prior art documents presented in the case. The parties agreed to withdraw from the pending infringement and nullity proceedings and entered into a settlement agreement on June 29, 2018. The Company paid Setec 75,000 Euro in exchange for a perpetual, worldwide royalty-free license to the patent-in-suit and all its counterparts.  
In 2015, one of the Company's subsidiaries in the PRC, Dongguan Transpower Electric Products Co., Ltd. ("Dongguan Transpower"), was provided notice of a claim by DG Yu Shing Industrial Development Company Limited against Dongguan Transpower and three other defendants for past due construction costs of approximately $3.2 million. In April 2018, the 3rd People Court of Dongguan ruled and provided an unfavorable judgment against Dongguan Transpower and two of the other defendants requiring payment of the aforementioned amount. The defendants were held to be jointly and severally liable for approximately $3.2 million in costs. Due to the fact that none of the other defendants had sufficient funds to pay the damages amount, the Court ordered the entire amount (CNY 20,133,174.10) to be paid by Dongguan Transpower. On May 25, 2018, the Court enforced its order and withdrew the damages amount from Dongguan Transpower's bank accounts. On May 31, 2018, Dongguan Transpower filed an action against the other defendants in CP Court to recoup the damages amount paid pursuant to an indemnification letter dated October 16, 2015. The Court heard arguments on July 2, 2018 and rendered a verdict on July 9, 2018 ordering the Jinmei entities (defendants) to pay CNY 20,133,174 back to Dongguan Transpower together with the incurred interest. On August 27, 2018, Dongguan Transpower received payment of CNY 20,430,203 (approximately $3.2 million) from the defendants and this case was closed. 
 On June 1, 2018, the Company filed an action against Unipower, LLC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for breach of contract. Specifically, the Company alleges in its Complaint that Unipower has willfully violated the Master Services Agreement ("MSA") entered into by the parties on January 23, 2015 by failing to make payment for the products it contracted for under the MSA. The Company is claiming irreparable harm and substantial damages in excess of $1.0 million. The case is currently in the discovery phase of the litigation. 
Net Sales – Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for such customer sales. Intercompany sales include finished products manufactured in foreign countries which are then transferred to the United States and Europe for sale; finished goods manufactured in the United States which are transferred to Europe and Asia for sale; and semi-finished components manufactured in the United States which are sold to Asia for further processing. 
On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of BCMZ Precision Engineering Limited, a UK manufacturer of precision machined components, for approximately $2.6 million in cash. The final purchase price remains subject to certain adjustments related to working capital. The transaction was funded with cash on hand. The purchase price allocation was still in progress and was not available at the time of filing of this Quarterly Report. 
BCMZ has a diversified portfolio of customers in the automotive, aerospace, defense, telecommunication, fibre-optic and medical industrial sectors and has been a long-term key supplier of precision machined components for our Cinch Connectivity Solutions UK business. BCMZ is additionally expected to give Cinch the capability to continue to support key defense and industrial customers across Europe with localized in-house machining ability.
