All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars in the text are in millions, except per share amounts or where otherwise noted.
When we cross-reference to a “Note,” we are referring to our “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,” unless the context indicates otherwise.
All amounts noted within the tables are in thousands and amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding.
We design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits.
These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries.
Bel’s portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets.
Costs are recorded as incurred for all products manufactured.
Such amounts are determined based upon the estimated stage of production and include labor cost and fringes and related allocations of factory overhead.
Our products are manufactured at various facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Dominican Republic, England, Czech Republic, Slovakia and the PRC.
Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition and be able to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.
These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, and overtime required in order to meet any increase in demand, can add volatility to the labor costs incurred by us.
  ·   Revenues – The Company’s revenues increased by $7.1 million (or 6.0%) in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018.
We also saw increased demand for our connectivity products for use in commercial aerospace applications, particularly from our after-market customers.
  ·   Backlog – Our backlog of orders amounted to $166.8 million at March 31, 2019, a decline of $4.4 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2018.
Since year-end, we saw an 11% increase in the backlog for our Connectivity Solutions products, driven by additional orders from our commercial aerospace and distribution customers.
The backlog of orders for our Power Solutions and Protection products declined by 7% and backlog for our Magnetic Solutions products was down 13% from year-end 2018 levels.
  ·   Pricing and Availability of Materials – While material cost and availability for certain components have started to ease, the higher raw material costs which were in place during 2018, particularly related to resistors, capacitors and mosfets, are still running through our statement of operations as we ship the balance of our inventory on hand from 2018.
Lead times continue to be extended for mosfets and costs for those components remain elevated.
As a result, the Company’s material costs as a percentage of sales increased to 41.8% during the first quarter of 2019 from 40.8% during the first quarter of 2018.
  ·   Labor Costs – Labor costs during the first quarter of 2019 increased from 11.3% of sales during the first quarter of 2018 to 11.5% of sales during the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to minimum wage increases in Mexico which went into effect on January 1, 2019 as well as minimum wage increases in the PRC which went into effect in the first and third quarters of 2018.
  ·   Impact of Foreign Currency – During the first quarter of 2019, the Company realized foreign exchange transactional losses of $0.6 million, offset by lower labor and overhead costs of $1.7 million related to favorable fluctuations in exchange rates versus 2018.
Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results and the revaluation of certain intercompany as well as third-party transactions to and from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows.
The Company was favorably impacted by transactional foreign exchange gains in the first quarter of 2019 due to the depreciation of the Euro, Pound, and Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as compared to exchange rates in effect during 2018.
The Company has significant manufacturing operations located in the PRC where labor and overhead costs are paid in local currency.
As a result, the U.S. Dollar equivalent costs of these operations were $1.7 million lower in 2019.
After record bookings throughout 2018, we’ve seen slower bookings during the first quarter of 2019 as customers work through their inventory on hand.
While this is expected to put some downward pressure on sales during the second quarter of 2019, we remain generally optimistic for sales improvement in the second half of year.
We anticipate demand on existing programs to be restored once customers work down their current inventory levels.
Sales growth is also expected within the areas of commercial aerospace and key military platforms related to fighter jet, munition and encryption applications later in the year for our connectivity solutions products, and our power products are well positioned on several new HEV applications.
We have also recently released a variety of products to support the upcoming 5G market, which is expected to provide further upside down the road.
The projections in this paragraph represent Forward-Looking Statements.
See “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Sales growth in our North America segment during the first quarter of 2019 was led by higher sales of our power products into U.S. datacenter applications and increased demand for our connectivity products from our commercial aerospace customers.
Our Europe segment benefited from additional sales of our power products into European datacenter applications during the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same quarter of 2018.
Net sales and income (loss) from operations by operating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows.
Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for customer sales.
Loss from operations for our North America segment was unfavorably impacted during the first quarter of 2019 by $0.9 million of restructuring costs associated with the transition of manufacturing and warehouse operations from our Inwood, New York facility to other existing Bel facilities, and higher labor costs in Mexico due to an increase in minimum wage rates which went into effect on January 1, 2019.
The increase in income from operations for our Asia segment was in line with the year-over-year sales increase for that segment.
Our Europe segment’s income from operations benefited from higher sales volume and a more favorable exchange rate environment in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same quarter of 2018.
The increase in sales of our connectivity solutions products during the first quarter of 2019 primarily related to higher demand from our commercial aerospace customers, both for new aircraft builds as well as to service after-market needs.
Material costs as a percentage of sales increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 primarily due to the industry-wide supply constraints related to certain of our purchased components during 2018.
The finished goods shipped during the first quarter of 2019 still contained some of the higher-cost raw material components.
Labor costs as a percentage of sales also increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 as the PRC government increased the minimum wage in the regions where Bel’s factories are located in February and July of 2018.
As such, the majority of the increases in the PRC did not impact the first quarter of 2018 financial results.
Furthermore, the minimum wage rates in Mexico increased effective January 1, 2019 which also drove labor costs higher in the first quarter of 2019.
These factors were partially offset by a more favorable exchange rate environment related to the Chinese Renminbi and Mexican Peso during the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same quarter of 2018.
In total, these other expenses decreased during the first quarter of 2019 by $0.3 million as compared to the same period of 2018, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization expense during the first quarter of 2019.
The Company’s effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which the pretax profits are earned.
Of the geographic segments in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe’s tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company’s three geographical segments.
The provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was less than $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
The Company’s earnings (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2019, were approximately $2.2 million higher than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to an increase in the income from the Europe and Asia segments, offset by greater losses in the U.S. segment.
The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in taxes related to uncertain tax positions and the impact of permanent differences on U.S. tax exempt activities.
Our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our credit facility.
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company repatriated $10.0 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with minimal incremental tax liability.
Management has current intentions to repatriate an additional $10 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with a minimal incremental tax liability, by the end of the third quarter of 2019 with the intent of reducing our outstanding debt balance.
The Company’s current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 3.1 to 1 at March 31, 2019 and 2.7 to 1 at December 31, 2018.
In June 2014, the Company entered into a senior Credit and Security Agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2016, and further amended and refinanced in December 2017.
The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined (“Leverage Ratio”), and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to the Company’s consolidated fixed charges (“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio”).
If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit and Security Agreement would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.
At March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.
The unused credit available under the credit facility at March 31, 2019 was $75.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $47.4 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company’s existing consolidated EBITDA.
  ·   purchases of property, plant and equipment of $2.4 million;
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, accounts receivable increased by $2.3 million primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in sales during the month of March 2019 as compared to the month of December 2018.
Inventory increased by $4.2 million at March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, primarily due to the recent slowdown in demand as customers work through their inventory levels on hand.
Inventory turns were 3.3 at March 31, 2019 as compared to 3.7 at December 31, 2018.
  ·   purchases of property, plant and equipment of $2.2 million;
  ·   dividend payments of $0.8 million; partially offset by
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, accounts receivable decreased by $2.5 million primarily due to lower sales volume in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Inventory increased by $4.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition (and related release of inventory from our books) in connection with the adoption of ASC 606.
This change in accounting was also the main driver in an increase in inventory turns from 3.6 at December 31, 2017 to 3.8 at March 31, 2018.
The discussion of new financial accounting standards applicable to the Company is incorporated herein by reference to Note 1 to the Company’s Financial Statements, “Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies,” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
