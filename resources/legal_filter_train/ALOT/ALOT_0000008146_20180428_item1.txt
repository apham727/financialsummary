The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods included herein.
Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
On February 1, 2018 we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
The core principle of ASC Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
ASC Topic 606 defines a five step process to recognize revenue and requires more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process than required under previous U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, determining and estimating the amount of any variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
We adopted this standard using the modified retrospective method and have applied the guidance to all contracts within the scope of ASC Topic 606 as of the February 1, 2018 adoption date.
Accordingly, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our revenue recognition and there was no cumulative effective adjustment as of February 1, 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 606.
Significant judgments primarily include the identification of performance obligation arrangements as well as the pattern of delivery for those services.
We derive revenue from the sale of (i) hardware including, digital color label printers and specialty OEM printing systems, portable data acquisition systems and airborne printers used in the flight deck and in the cabin of military, commercial and business aircraft, (ii) related supplies required in the operation of the hardware, (iii) repairs and maintenance of equipment and (iv) service agreements.
The transfer of control generally occurs at one point in time, upon shipment, when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to revenue.
The majority of our hardware products contain embedded operating systems and data management software which is included in the purchase price of the equipment.
Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and are accounted for as a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to the customer.
The delivery of installation and training services are not assessed to determine whether they are separate performance obligations, as the amounts are not material to the contract.
Shipping and handling activities that occur after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations, as allowed under a practical expedient.
These services are short in duration, typically less than one month, and total less than 9.0% of revenue for the period ended April 28, 2018.
Revenue is recognized as services are rendered and accepted by the customer.
We also provide service agreements on certain of our Product Identification equipment.
Service agreements are purchased separately from the equipment and provide for the right to obtain service and maintenance on the equipment for a period of typically one to two years.
The standard warranty period is typically 12 months for most hardware products except for airborne printers, which typically have warranties that extend for 4-5 years, consistent with industry practice.
On occasion, customers request a warranty period longer than our standard warranty.
The portion of service contracts and extended warranty services agreements that are uncompleted at the end of any reporting period are included in deferred revenue.
Credit is extended based upon an evaluation of the customers financial condition.
Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value.
Standard payment terms are typically 30 days after shipment, but vary by type and geographic location of our customers.
We normally do not have contract assets, which are primarily unbilled accounts receivable that are conditional on something other than the passage of time.
The decrease in the deferred revenue balance during the three months ended April 28, 2018 is primarily due to approximately $175,000 of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2018, offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations.
 estimated benefit term, which is currently estimated to be approximately 10 years.
There has been no change in the Companys accounting for these contracts as a result of the adoption ASC Topic 606.
The balance of these contract assets at January 31, 2018 was $832,000 and was reported in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, amortization of these incremental direct costs was $9,000 and the balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at April 28, 2018 was $973,000 which is reported in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
This amount is expected to be amortized over its estimated remaining period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately 8 years.
These costs include sales commissions paid to the internal direct sales team as well as to third-party representatives and distributors.
Generally speaking, the contracts are all individual procurement decisions by the customers and do not include renewal provisions and as such the majority of the contracts have an economic life of significantly less than a year.
The Honeywell Agreement also provided for guaranteed minimum royalty payments of $15.0 million, to be paid to Honeywell over the next ten years, based on gross revenues from the sales of the printers, paper and repair services of the licensed products.
The royalty rates vary based on the year in which they are paid or earned and product sold or service provided, and range from single-digit to mid double-digit percentages of gross revenue.
The minimum royalty payment obligation of $15.0 million was recorded at the present value of the minimum annual royalty payments using a present value factor of 2.8%, which is based on the estimated after tax cost of debt for similar companies.
At April 28, 2018, the current portion of the royalty obligation to be paid over the next twelve months is $1.5 million and is reported as a current liability and the remainder of $11.4 million is reported as a long-term liability on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company incurred $0.5 million in excess royalty expense, which is included in cost of goods sold in the Companys condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended April 28, 2018.
A total of $0.9 million of excess royalty is payable at April 28, 2018 and reported as a current liability on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet.
In connection with the Honeywell Agreement, the Company also entered into a Transition Services Agreement (TSA) with Honeywell related to the transfer of the manufacturing and repair of the licensed printers from their current locations to AstroNovas plant in West Warwick, Rhode Island.
Subject to the completion of the terms of the TSA by Honeywell International, the Company may be required to make an additional payment of $0.4 million to acquire an additional repair facility revenue stream.
At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company determined that this payment was probable and recorded a $0.4 million contingent liability which is included as a current liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at April 28, 2018.
The additional $0.4 million TSA obligation was included as part of the Honeywell Agreement purchase price and recorded as an increase to the related intangible asset.
Under the terms of the TSA, the Company is required to pay for certain expenses incurred by Honeywell during the period in which product manufacturing is transferred to the Companys facilities.
In addition, in the period ending April 28, 2018, a change in accounting estimates for revenue subject to customer rebates under the Honeywell Agreement increased operating income by $0.4 million ($0.3 million net of tax or $0.05 per diluted share).
Transaction costs incurred for this acquisition were $0.3 million and were included as part of the purchase price.
The purchase price, including the initial payment, the minimum royalty payment obligation, transaction costs, and the subsequent TSA $0.4 million obligation, were allocated based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired.
The fair value of the intangible assets acquired was estimated by applying the income approach.
These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure. Key assumptions in estimating the fair value of the intangibles include (1) the remaining life of the intangibles based on the term of the Honeywell Asset Purchase and License Agreement of 10 years, (2) a range of annual earnings projections from $3.9 million  $5.4 million and (3) the Companys internal rate of return of 21.0%.
On February 1, 2017, our wholly-owned Danish subsidiary, ANI ApS, completed the acquisition of the issued and outstanding equity interests of TrojanLabel ApS (TrojanLabel).
The purchase price of this acquisition was 62.9 million Danish Krone (approximately $9.1 million), net of cash acquired of 976,000 Danish Krone (approximately $0.1 million), of which 6.4 million Danish Krone (approximately $0.9 million) was placed in escrow to secure certain post-closing working capital adjustments and indemnification obligations of the sellers.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company settled the post-closing adjustments with TrojanLabel and recovered approximately 891,000 Danish Krone (approximately $145,000) of the amount held in escrow account, which was recognized as an adjustment to the allowance account for TrojanLabel receivables.
The remaining escrow balance was retained by TrojanLabel.
For the three months ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017, the diluted per share amounts do not include common equivalent shares outstanding of 248,480 and 472,214, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
There were no impairments to intangible assets during the periods ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017.
With respect to the acquired intangibles included in the table above, amortization expense of $1,024,000 and $298,000, has been included in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017, respectively.
During the three months ended April 28, 2018, we had one equity incentive plan pursuant to which we grant equity awards  the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan).
The 2015 Plan will expire in May 2025.
The exercise price of each stock option is established at the discretion of the Compensation Committee; however, all options granted under the 2015 Plan must be issued at an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant.
The 2015 Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000 shares (subject to adjustment for stock dividends and stock splits), and at April 28, 2018, 99,284 shares were available for grant under the 2015 Plan.
Under the 2015 Plan, each non-employee director receives an automatic annual grant of ten-year options to purchase 5,000 shares of stock upon the adjournment of each annual shareholders meeting.
Each such option is exercisable at the fair market value of the Companys common stock as of the grant date, and vests immediately prior to the next annual shareholders meeting.
The Company has a Non-Employee Director Annual Compensation Program (the Program) under which each non-employee director receives an automatic grant of RSAs on the first business day of each fiscal quarter.
Under the Program, the number of whole shares to be granted each quarter is equal to 25% of the number calculated by dividing the director compensation amount by the fair market value of the Companys stock on such day.
In addition, the Chairman of the Board receives RSAs with an aggregate value of $6,000, and the Chairs of the Audit and Compensation Committees each receive RSAs with an aggregate value of $4,000, also issued in quarterly installments and calculated in the same manner as the directors RSA grants.
RSAs granted subsequent to March 30, 2017 become vested three months after the date of grant.
A total of 8,542 and 7,233 shares were awarded to the non-employee directors as compensation under the Program in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In March 2015 (fiscal year 2016), the Company granted 50,000 options and 537 RSAs to its Chief Executive Officer pursuant to an Equity Incentive Award Agreement dated as of November 24, 2014 (CEO Equity Incentive Agreement), and 35,000 options to other key employees.
In May 2015 (fiscal year 2016), the Company granted an aggregate of 80,000 time-based and 155,000 performance-based RSUs (2016 RSUs) to certain officers of the Company.
The performance-based 2016 RSUs vest over three years based upon the increase in revenue, if any, achieved each fiscal year relative to a three-year revenue increase goal.
Performance-based 2016 RSUs that are earned based on organic revenue growth are fully vested when earned, while those earned based on revenue growth via acquisitions vest annually over a three-year period following the fiscal year in which the revenue growth occurs.
Any performance-based 2016 RSUs that were not earned at the end of fiscal 2018 were forfeited.
The expense for such shares was recognized in the fiscal year in which the results were achieved, however, the shares were not fully earned until approved by the Compensation Committee in the first quarter of the following fiscal year.
Based upon revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, 33,638, 9,025 and 15,810 shares of the performance based RSUs were earned in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In March 2016 (fiscal year 2017), the Company granted 50,000 options and 4,030 RSAs to its Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the CEO Equity Incentive Agreement.
In May 2016 (fiscal year 2017) the Company granted 37,000 options to certain key employees.
On August 1, 2016 (fiscal year 2017) the Company granted 5,000 options to its Chief Financial Officer.
In March 2017 (fiscal year 2018), the Company granted 50,000 options to the Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the CEO Equity Incentive Agreement.
In February and April 2017 the Company granted 52,189 options to certain other key employees.
In December 2017, upon election to the Board, the Company granted 5,000 non-qualified options and 675 RSUs to a Board member.
Subsequent to quarter end, at the Companys annual meeting of shareholders held on June 4, 2018, the Companys shareholders approved the AstroNova, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan).
Following the approval of the 2018 Plan at the Companys annual meeting of shareholders, the Company will not grant new equity awards pursuant to the 2015 Plan.
The weighted average fair value per share for options granted was $6.80 during the three months ended April 28, 2018, compared to $4.11 during the three months ended April 29, 2017.
As of April 28, 2018, there was approximately $758,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.6 years.
As of April 28, 2018, there was approximately $491,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs and RSAs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years.
AstroNova has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan allowing eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a 15% discount from fair value on the first or last day of an offering period, whichever is less.
A total of 247,500 shares were reserved for issuance under this plan.
During the three months ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017, there were 1,216 and 1,507 shares, respectively, purchased under this plan.
As of April 28, 2018, 37,991 shares remain available.
The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time.
The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur.
During the three months ended April 28, 2018, the Company recognized an income tax expense of approximately $181,000.
During the three months ended April 29, 2017, the Company recognized an income tax expense of approximately $147,000.
As of April 28, 2018, the Companys cumulative unrecognized tax benefits totaled $626,000 compared to $665,000 as of January 31, 2018.
There were no other developments affecting unrecognized tax benefits during the quarter ended April 28, 2018.
ASU 2018-05 allows a company to record a provisional amount when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the changes in the Tax Reform Act.
The measurement period ends when the company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Reform Act.
During the three months ended April 28, 2018, there were no changes made to the provisional amounts recognized in fiscal 2018.
We will complete our analysis over a one-year measurement period ending December 22, 2018, and any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in net earnings from continuing operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined.
On February 28, 2017, the Company and its wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS (together, the Parties), entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A.
The Credit Agreement also provided for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility available to the Company for general corporate purposes.
In connection with the Honeywell Purchase and License Agreement, on September 28, 2017, the Parties entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender.
On November 30, 2017, the Parties entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender.
The Second Amendment provided for a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million, in addition to the revolving credit facility for the Company and the term loan previously borrowed by ANI ApS at the original closing under the Credit Agreement.
The principal amount of the revolving credit facility which had been temporarily increased to $15.0 million was reduced to $10.0 million effective upon the closing of the Second Amendment and the maturity date for the revolving credit facility was extended to November 30, 2022.
On April 17, 2018, the Parties entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender.
The Third Amendment provides that no Immaterial Subsidiary will be required to become a guarantor or securing party under (unless requested by the Lender during default) or have its equity pledged pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
The Third Amendment defines Immaterial Subsidiary as any subsidiary of the Company with (a) consolidated total assets that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and (b) revenues that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter; provided that Immaterial Subsidiaries shall not account for, in the aggregate, more than 10% the of consolidated total assets or consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries.
In connection with the Credit Agreement, AstroNova and ANI ApS entered into certain hedging arrangements with the Lender to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency risk associated with its payments in respect of the term loans.
Refer to Note 13, Derivative Financial Instruments and Risk Management for further information about these arrangements.
Revolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Companys option, in U.S.
Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Krone.
Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S.
Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of Americas publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility at the rate of 0.25% per annum.
The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
The financial covenants consist of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio.
The Credit Agreement contains limitations, in each case subject to various exceptions and thresholds, on the Companys and its subsidiaries ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to conduct mergers or acquisitions, to sell assets, to alter their capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness.
The Credit Agreement permits the Company to pay cash dividends on and repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to certain limitations.
The obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel.
The Companys obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Companys wholly-owned German subsidiary Astro-Med GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.
As of April 28, 2018, there are no borrowings against the revolving credit facility and we believe the Company is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.
The Company has entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the floating-rate foreign currency-denominated term loan borrowing by our Danish Subsidiary and an interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate $15.0 million term loan borrowing by the Company.
In accordance with the guidance in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, both swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of floating-rate borrowings.
The cross-currency interest rate swap agreement utilized by the Company effectively modifies the Companys exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk by converting approximately $8.9 million of the Companys floating-rate debt denominated in U.S.
Dollars on our Danish subsidiarys books to a fixed-rate debt denominated in Danish Krone for the term of the loan, thus reducing the impact of interest-rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes on future interest expense and principal repayments.
As of April 28, 2018, the total notional amount of the Companys cross-currency interest rate swap was $7.4 million and is included in other long term liabilities in the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet at its fair value amount of $1.2 million.
As of April 28, 2018, the total notional amount of the Companys interest rate swap was $13.5 million and is included in other assets in the Companys condensed consolidated balance at its fair value amount of $0.2 million.
 commonly referred to as the Tax Act.
This ASU is effective immediately as new information is available to adjust provisional amounts that were previously recorded.
The Company has adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and expects the accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act to be completed during the measurement period.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
ASU 2014-09 applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services.
Under this guidance, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230). ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice for certain cash receipts and cash payments.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 supersedes current guidance related to accounting for leases and is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities in the balance sheet for operating leases with lease terms greater than twelve months.
ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (Q1 fiscal 2020 for AstroNova), with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
Fair value is applied to our financial assets and liabilities including money market funds, available for sale securities, derivative instruments and a contingent consideration liability relating to an earnout payment on future TrojanLabel operating results.
The market approach is based on using quoted prices for identical or similar assets.
We also use the market approach to measure fair value of our derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments were measured at fair value using readily observable market inputs, such as quotations on interest rates and foreign exchange rates, and is classified as Level 2 because they are an over-the-counter contract with a bank counterparty that is not traded in an active market.
Key assumptions in estimating the fair value of the contingent consideration liability included (1) the estimated earnout targets over the next seven years of $0.5 million-$1.4 million, (2) the probability of success (achievement of the various contingent events) from 0.0%-0.9% and (3) a risk-adjusted discount rate of approximately 2.68%-4.9% used to adjust the probability-weighted earnout payments to their present value.
There was no change in the fair value of the earnout liability for the quarter ended April 28, 2018.
The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including the current portion, is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar borrowings with the same maturities would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and is classified as Level 3.
 Item 1A.
There have been no material updates to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018.
