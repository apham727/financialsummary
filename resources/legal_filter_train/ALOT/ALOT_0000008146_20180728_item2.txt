Three Months Ended July 28, 2018 vs. Three Months Ended July 29, 2017  
Revenue for the second quarter of the current year was $33.8 million, representing a 23.0% increase compared to the previous year second quarter revenue of $27.5 million. Revenue through domestic channels for the current year second quarter was $20.0 million, an increase of 16.3% over the prior years second quarter. International revenue for the second quarter of the current year was $13.8 million, a 34.0% increase over the previous years second quarter and represents 41% of AstroNovas second quarters revenue. Current year second quarter international revenue includes a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.3 million.  
Supplies revenue in the current quarter was $17.9 million, a 9.8% increase over the prior years second quarter supplies revenue of $16.3 million.  
Current year second quarter gross profit was $13.4 million, a 30.6% increase compared to prior year second quarter gross profit of $10.3 million. The Companys current quarter gross profit margin of 39.6% reflects a 2.3 percentage point increase from the prior year second quarter gross profit margin of 37.3%. The higher gross profit and related profit margin for the current quarter compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to increased sales and favorable product mix.  
Other expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.5 million compared to $16 thousand of other income in the prior year second quarter. Current quarter other expense includes interest expense on debt of $0.2 million and foreign exchange loss of $0.3 million. Other income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 includes foreign exchange gain of $59 thousand and investment income of $68 thousand, offset by interest expense on debt of $82 thousand and other expense of $30 thousand.  
The Company reported net income of $1.2 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the second quarter of the current year. On a comparable basis, net income for the prior year second quarter was $0.7 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Return on revenue was 3.5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 2.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.  
Revenue for the first six months of the current year was $65.3 million, representing a 25.7% increase compared to the previous years first six months of revenue of $51.9 million. Revenue through domestic channels for the first half of the current year was $39.2 million, an increase of 19.1% from the prior year. International revenue for the first six months of the current year was $26.1 million, a 37.4% increase from the previous year. The current years first six months international revenue included an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $1.1 million.  
Supplies revenue in the first half of the current year was $34.6 million, representing an 11.3% increase over the prior years first six months revenue of $31.1 million. The current year increase in supplies revenue is due primarily to the increase in digital color printer supplies product revenue, as well as label and tag revenue in the Product Identification segment.  
Current year first six months gross profit was $25.5 million, a 30.4% increase from prior years first six months gross profit of $19.6 million. The Companys gross profit margin of 39.1% in the current year reflects an increase from the prior years first six months gross profit margin of 37.7%. The higher gross profit and related margin for the current year compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher sales and favorable product mix.  
The Company reported net income of $2.0 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the first six months of the current year, which included $0.8 million of after-tax income, or $0.12 per diluted share, as a result of a change in accounting estimates in the first quarter for product cost and operating expenses related to a transition services agreement entered into with Honeywell in connection with the Honeywell Agreement. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a change in accounting estimate for revenue subject to customer rebates under the Honeywell Agreement increased net income by $0.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share. In the prior years first six months, the Company recognized net income of $1.2 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. Return on revenue was 3.1% for the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to 2.4% for the first six months of fiscal 2018.  
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we converted our securities available for sale to cash. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we drew $3.0 million on our revolving credit facility, of which $1.5 million was repaid during the quarter and $1.5 million remained outstanding as of July 28, 2018. Our cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter were $5.9 million and we have $8.5 million remaining available under our revolving credit facility.  
On February 28, 2017, the Company and its wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS (together, the Parties), entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the Lender). The Credit Agreement provided for a term loan to ANI ApS in the principal amount of $9.2 million. The Credit Agreement also provided for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility available to the Company for general corporate purposes.  
In connection with the Honeywell Purchase and License Agreement, on September 28, 2017, the Parties entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The First Amendment amended the existing Credit Agreement to permit the Honeywell Agreement and temporarily increased the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility from $10.0 million to $15.0 million. The initial upfront payment of $14.6 million for the Honeywell Agreement was paid using borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility.  
On November 30, 2017, the Parties entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The Second Amendment provided for a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million, in addition to the revolving credit facility for the Company and the term loan previously borrowed by ANI ApS at the original closing under the Credit Agreement. The proceeds from the term loan were used to repay the entire $14.6 million principal balance of the revolving loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The principal amount of the revolving credit facility which had been temporarily increased to $15.0 million was reduced to $10.0 million effective upon closing of the Second Amendment and the maturity date was extended to November 30, 2022.  
On April 17, 2018, the Parties entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The Third Amendment provides that no Immaterial Subsidiary will be required to become a guarantor or securing party under (unless requested by the Lender during default) or have its equity pledged pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment defines Immaterial Subsidiary as any subsidiary of the Company with (a) consolidated total assets that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and (b) revenues that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter; provided that Immaterial Subsidiaries shall not account for, in the aggregate, more than 10% the of consolidated total assets or consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries.  
The obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel. The Companys obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Companys wholly-owned German subsidiary Astro-Med GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.  
The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.  
The Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default.  
As of July 28, 2018, we believe the Company is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.  
The Companys statements of cash flows for the six months ended July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 are included on page 6 of this report. Net cash used by operating activities was $2.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to net cash provided of $1.7 million for the same period of the previous year. The increase in net cash used by operations for the first six months of the current year is primarily due to payments of prior quarters accrued expenses to Honeywell under the TSA agreement, slower collections on accounts receivable related to Honeywell customers and the increase in inventory to support the transition of the production of printers to the West Warwick facility in accordance with the Honeywell TSA. The combination of these factors on accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased cash by $7.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to a decrease of $1.6 million for the same period in fiscal 2018. The accounts receivable balance increased to $24.0 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $22.4 million at year end and the collection cycle increased to 59 days compared to 55 days at year end. The inventory balance was $28.4 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $27.6 million at year end and inventory days on hand increased to 125 days at the end of the current quarter from 124 days at the prior year end.  
The decreased cash and investment position at July 28, 2018, primarily resulted from increased cash used in operations as discussed above, principal payments of long-term debt of $2.9 million, dividends paid of $1.0 million and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $0.8 million.  
The Companys backlog increased 14.5% from year-end to $24.5 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
