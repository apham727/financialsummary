Generally, our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities.

On February 28, 2017, the Company and its wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS (together, the Parties), entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A.
The Credit Agreement also provided for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility available to the Company for general corporate purposes.
In connection with the Honeywell Purchase and License Agreement, on September 28, 2017, the Parties entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender.
The First Amendment amended the existing Credit Agreement to permit the Honeywell Agreement and temporarily increased the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility from $10.0 million to $15.0 million.
On November 30, 2017, the Parties entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender.
The Second Amendment provided for a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million, in addition to the revolving credit facility for the Company and the term loan previously borrowed by ANI ApS at the original closing under the Credit Agreement.
The principal amount of the revolving credit facility which had been temporarily increased to $15.0 million was reduced to $10.0 million effective upon closing of the Second Amendment and the maturity date was extended to November 30, 2022.
On April 17, 2018, the Parties entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender.
The Third Amendment provides that no Immaterial Subsidiary will be required to become a guarantor or securing party under (unless requested by the Lender during default) or have its equity pledged pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
The Third Amendment defines Immaterial Subsidiary as any subsidiary of the Company with (a) consolidated total assets that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and (b) revenues that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter; provided that Immaterial Subsidiaries shall not account for, in the aggregate, more than 10% the of consolidated total assets or consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Revolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Companys option, in U.S.
Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Krone.
Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S.
Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of Americas publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
The obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel.
The Companys obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Companys wholly-owned German subsidiary Astro-Med GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.
The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
The Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default.
As of July 28, 2018, we believe the Company is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.
The Companys statements of cash flows for the six months ended July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 are included on page 6 of this report.
Net cash used by operating activities was $2.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to net cash provided of $1.7 million for the same period of the previous year.
The increase in net cash used by operations for the first six months of the current year is primarily due to payments of prior quarters accrued expenses to Honeywell under the TSA agreement, slower collections on accounts receivable related to Honeywell customers and the increase in inventory to support the transition of the production of printers to the West Warwick facility in accordance with the Honeywell TSA.
The accounts receivable balance increased to $24.0 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $22.4 million at year end and the collection cycle increased to 59 days compared to 55 days at year end.
The inventory balance was $28.4 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $27.6 million at year end and inventory days on hand increased to 125 days at the end of the current quarter from 124 days at the prior year end.
The decreased cash and investment position at July 28, 2018, primarily resulted from increased cash used in operations as discussed above, principal payments of long-term debt of $2.9 million, dividends paid of $1.0 million and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $0.8 million.
The Companys backlog increased 14.5% from year-end to $24.5 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
