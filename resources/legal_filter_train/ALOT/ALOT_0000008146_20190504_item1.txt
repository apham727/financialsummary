Unless otherwise indicated, references to AstroNova, the Company, we, our, and us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to AstroNova, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  
Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.  
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  
The accounting polices used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q are the same as those used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended January 31, 2019, except for the change resulting from the adoption of Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as provided below.  
On February 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02 using the modified retrospective transition method, which requires that we recognize leases differently pre- and post-adoption. See Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsLeases below for more information.  
The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Our lease agreements cover various office facilities and are considered operating leases. Operating Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future payments. Operating lease ROU assets include any lease pre-payments made and exclude lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred when appropriate. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in general and administrative expense on our condensed consolidated statement of income. Operating leases are included in Right of Use assets, Other Liabilities and Accrued Expenses, and Lease Liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
For our lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, we generally account for each component separately.  
The Company adopted this guidance effective February 1, 2019 and elected the non-comparative transition option which does not require restatement for comparative purposes. Also upon adoption, the Company elected the package of practical expedients, which, include not reassessing 1) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases, 2) lease classifications of expired or existing leases, and 3) initial direct costs, if any, for existing leases.  
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of ROU assets and lease liabilities of $2.0 million as of February 1, 2019.  
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years (Q1 fiscal 2021 for AstroNova), with early adoption permitted. The provisions of ASU 2018-13 relating to changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. The remaining provisions should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
We derive revenue from the sale of (i) hardware, including digital color label printers and specialty OEM printing systems, portable data acquisition systems and airborne printers used in the flight deck and cabin of military, commercial and business aircraft, (ii) related supplies required in the operation of the hardware, (iii) repairs and maintenance of hardware and (iv) service agreements.  
We normally do not have contract assets, which are primarily unbilled accounts receivable that are conditional on something other than the passage of time. Our contract liabilities, which represent billings in excess of revenue recognized, are related to advanced billings for purchased service agreements and extended warranties and were $350,000 and $373,000 at May 4, 2019 and January 31, 2019, respectively, and are recorded as deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The decrease in the deferred revenue balance during the three months ended May 4, 2019 is primarily due to approximately $205,000 of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2019, offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations.  
For the three months ended May 4, 2019 and April 28, 2018, the diluted per share amounts do not include common equivalent shares outstanding of 260,422 and 248,480, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  
There were no impairments to intangible assets during the periods ended May 4, 2019 and April 28, 2018. With respect to the acquired intangibles included in the table above, amortization expense of $1.1 million and $1.0 million has been included in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods ended May 4, 2019 and April 28, 2018, respectively.  
During fiscal 2019, $3.0 million was drawn on the revolving credit facility, of which $1.5 million was repaid. At May 4, 2019, $1.5 million remains outstanding on the revolving line of credit. The outstanding balance bears interest at a weighted average annual rate of 5.75% and $19,000 of interest has been incurred on this obligation and included in other expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated income statement for the period ended May 4, 2019. As of May 4, 2019, there is $8.5 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.  
The Company has entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the floating-rate foreign currency-denominated term loan borrowing by our Danish Subsidiary and an interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate term loan borrowing by the Company. Both swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of floating-rate borrowings.  
The cross-currency interest rate swap agreement utilized by the Company effectively modifies the Companys exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk by converting the Companys floating-rate debt denominated in U.S. Dollars on our Danish subsidiarys books to a fixed-rate debt denominated in Danish Krone for the term of the loan, thus reducing the impact of interest-rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes on future interest expense and principal repayments. This swap involves the receipt of floating rate amounts in U.S. Dollars in exchange for fixed-rate interest payments in Danish Krone, as well as exchanges of principal at the inception spot rate, over the life of the term loan. As of May 4, 2019, the total notional amount of the Companys cross-currency interest rate swap was $5.9 million.  
The interest rate swap agreement utilized by the Company on its term loan effectively modifies the Companys exposure to interest rate risk by converting the Companys floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt for the next five years, thus reducing the impact of interest-rate changes on future interest expense. This swap involves the receipt of floating rate amounts in U.S. Dollars in exchange for fixed rate payments in U.S. dollars over the life of the term loan. As of May 4, 2019, the total notional amount of the Companys interest rate swap was $10.5 million.  
At May 4, 2019, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $0.3 million of net gains on the swap contracts from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings during the next 12 months due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the payment of variable interest associated with the floating-rate debt.  
In fiscal 2018, AstroNova, Inc. entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell International, Inc. (Honeywell) to acquire an exclusive, perpetual, world-wide license to manufacture Honeywells narrow-format flight deck printers for two aircraft families along with certain inventory used in the manufacturing of the licensed printers. The purchase price included a guaranteed minimum royalty payment of $15.0 million, to be paid over ten years, based on gross revenues from the sales of the printers, paper and repair services of the licensed products. The royalty rates vary based on the year in which they are paid or earned and product sold or service provided, and range from single-digit to mid double-digit percentages of gross revenue.  
The guaranteed minimum royalty payment obligation of $15.0 million was recorded at the present value of the minimum annual royalty payments using a present value factor of 2.8%, which is based on the estimated after-tax cost of debt for similar companies. As of May 4, 2019, the Company had paid an aggregate of $2.0 million of the guaranteed minimum royalty obligation. At May 4, 2019, the current portion of the outstanding guaranteed minimum royalty obligation of $2.0 million is to be paid over the next twelve months and is reported as a current liability and the remainder of $9.4 million is reported as a long-term liability on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the guaranteed minimum royalty payments, the Company also incurred $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in excess royalty expense, which is included in cost of revenue in the Companys consolidated statements of income for the three months ended May 4, 2019 and April 28, 2018, respectively. A total of $1.3 million of excess royalty is payable and reported as a current liability on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet at May 4, 2019.  
We lease certain facilities at various locations worldwide that are classified as operating leases. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 to 12 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for periods up to 5 years, as well as options to terminate the lease within one year when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise such options.  
The company leases office space from an affiliate. The lease is classified as an operating lease and provides for annual rentals of approximately $64,000 and $66,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2021, respectively.  
As of May 4, 2019, the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for our operating leases are 6.3 years and 4.02%, respectively. We calculated the weighted-average discount rates using incremental borrowing rates, which equal the rates of interest that we would pay to borrow funds on a fully collateralized basis over a similar term.  
In addition to the 2018 Plan, we previously granted equity awards under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan) and our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan). Both the 2007 Plan and the 2015 Plan have expired and no new awards may be issued under either, but outstanding awards will continue to be governed by those respective Plans. As of May 4, 2019, 1,007 unvested shares of restricted stock and options to purchase an aggregate of 391,145 shares were outstanding under the 2007 Plan and 42,204 unvested shares of restricted stock and options to purchase an aggregate of 199,545 shares were outstanding under the 2015 Plan.  
On January 31, 2019, the compensation committee of the Companys board of directors adopted an Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Annual Compensation Program (the New Program), which became effective as of February 1, 2019 and supersedes the prior program. Pursuant to the New Program, beginning with fiscal 2020, each non-employee director will automatically receive a grant of restricted stock on the date of their re-election to the Companys board of directors. The number of whole shares to be granted will be equal to the number calculated by dividing the stock component of the director compensation amount determined by the compensation committee for that year by the fair market value of our stock on that day. The value of the restricted stock award for fiscal 2020 is $60,000. To account for the partial year beginning on February 1, 2019 and continuing through the 2019 annual meeting and thereby provide for the alignment of the timing of annual grants of restricted stock under the New Program with the election of directors at the annual meeting, on February 1, 2019, each non-employee director was granted shares of restricted stock with a fair market value of $18,000. Other than the shares granted on February 1, 2019, which will vest on June 1, 2019, shares of restricted stock granted under the New Program will become vested on the first anniversary of the date of grant, conditioned upon the recipients continued service on the Board through that date.  
As of May 4, 2019, there was approximately $1,232,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.2 years.  
As of May 4, 2019, there was approximately $2,961,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs and RSAs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.2 years.  
AstroNova has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan allowing eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a 15% discount from fair value on the first or last day of an offering period, whichever is less. A total of 247,500 shares were reserved for issuance under this plan. During the three months ended May 4, 2019 and April 28, 2018, there were 1,571 and 1,216 shares, respectively, purchased under this plan. As of May 4, 2019, 32,282 shares remain available.  
The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal quarter in which the change is determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur.  
We use the market approach to measure fair value of our derivative instruments. Derivative instruments were measured at fair value using readily observable market inputs, such as quotations on interest rates and foreign exchange rates, and are classified as Level 2 because they are over-the-counter contracts with a bank counterparty that are not traded in an active market.  
The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including the current portion, is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with the same maturities would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and is classified as Level 3.  
There have been no material updates to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019.
