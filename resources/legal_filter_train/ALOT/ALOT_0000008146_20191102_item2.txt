Supplies revenue in the current quarter was $17.7 million, a 2.5% decrease over prior years third quarter supplies revenue of $18.1 million.
The decrease in the current quarter supplies revenue as compared to the third quarter of the prior year is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue of QuickLabel product supplies in the Product Identification segment.

This compares to the prior years third quarter tax provision of $0.4 million, which reflected a benefit of $0.1 million related to windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and an effective tax rate of 22.3%.
The Company reported net income of $0.5 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the third quarter of the current year.

Supplies revenue in the first nine months of the current year was $55.5 million, representing a 5.3% increase over the prior years first nine months revenue of $52.7 million.
The current year increase in supplies revenue is due primarily to the increase in inkjet printer supplies and label sales, tempered by lower thermal film and electrophotographic supplies revenue in the Product Identification segment.
Service and other revenues were $10.0 million in the first nine months of the current year, a 13.4% increase compared to the prior years first nine months service and other revenues of $8.8 million.
Also contributing to the current year increase were sales of parts in the Product Identification segment as a result of the increase in the installed base of printers currently in the field.

Other expense during the first nine months of the current year was $0.8 million compared to $1.3 million in the first nine months of the previous year.
Current year other expense includes interest expense of $0.6 million on the Companys debt and revolving credit line and $0.3 million of net foreign exchange loss which was partially offset by investment and other income of $0.1 million.

On a comparable basis, net income for the first nine months of the prior year was $3.4 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, which included $0.8 million of after-tax income, or $0.12 per diluted share, as a result of a change in accounting estimates in the prior years first quarter for product cost and operating expenses related to a transition services agreement entered into with Honeywell in connection with the Honeywell Agreement.
In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a change in accounting estimate for revenue subject to customer rebates under the Honeywell Agreement increased net income by $0.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share.

Total current quarter revenue from the Product Identification segment of $21.7 million was comparable to revenue for the same period of the prior year.
Product Identifications current quarter segment operating profit was $1.9 million, reflecting a profit margin of 8.6%.
This compares to the prior years third quarter segment profit of $2.0 million and related profit margin of 9.3%.
The current year increase is primarily attributable to strong demand for ink jet supplies in the first quarter from Asian customers, which subsequently declined.
