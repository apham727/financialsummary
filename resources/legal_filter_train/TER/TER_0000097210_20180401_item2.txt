Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which are not historical facts, so called forward-looking statements, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
See also Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
During the first quarter of 2018, demand outlook for mobile device test capacity in 2018 declined sharply for our Semiconductor Test business.
The acquisition of Universal Robots provides a growth engine to our business and complements our existing System Test and Wireless Test segments.
The remaining maximum contingent consideration that could be paid in 2019 is $25 million.
On February 26, 2018, we acquired Energid Technologies Corporation (Energid) for a total preliminary purchase price of approximately $27.6 million.
Energids technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets, ranging from heavy industry to healthcare; utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots.
MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications.
MiR and Energid will be included in our Industrial Automation segment.
In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer.
Our determination of revenue is dependent upon a five step process outlined below.
We periodically enter into contracts with its customers in which a customer may purchase a combination of goods and or services, such as products with extended warranty obligations.
We determine performance obligations by assessing whether the products or services are distinct from the other elements of the contract.
In order to be distinct the product or service must perform either on its own or with readily available resources and must be separate within the context of the contract.
We considers the amount stated on the face of the purchase order to be the transaction price.
We use standalone transactions when available to value each performance obligation.
Any discounts from standalone selling price are spread over each performance obligation.
In order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition, we first determine if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition.
If the transaction meets the criteria for over time recognition, we recognize revenue as the good or service is delivered.
We use input variables such as hours or months utilized or costs incurred to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in a given period.
Input variables are used as they best align consumption with benefit to the customer.
For transactions which do not meet the criteria for over time recognition, we will recognize revenue at a point in time based on an assessment of the five criteria for transfer of control.
We have concluded that revenue should be recognized when shipped or delivered based on contractual terms.
Typically acceptance of our products and services is a formality as we deliver similar systems, instruments and robots to standard specifications.
In cases where acceptance is not deemed a formality, we will wait for customer acceptance before recognizing revenue.
 expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses, are required to be reported separately outside of income or loss from operations.
Following the adoption of this guidance, we continue to record the service cost component in the same line item as other employee compensation costs and the non-service components of net benefit costs such as interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses are reported within other (income) expense, net.
The retrospective adoption of this standard increased the first quarter of 2017 income from operations by $0.4 million due to the removal of the non-service component of pension expense and decreased other (income) expense, net by the same amount with zero impact to net income.
The increase in Semiconductor Test revenues of $17.8 million, or 5.0%, was driven primarily by increased sales in the flash memory test segment, partially offset by a decrease in image sensor and microcontroller sales.
The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $12.5 million, or 34.4%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms.
The increase in System Test revenues of $3.2 million, or 8.0%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of system level testers.
The decrease in Wireless Test revenues of $2.8 million, or 11.1%, was primarily due to lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems.
 (1) Revenues attributable to a country are based on location of customer site.
Gross profit as a percent of revenue decreased by 2.6 points, as a result of a decrease related to product mix primarily in Semiconductor Test, partially offset by an increase due to higher sales primarily in Semiconductor Test and Industrial Automation.
This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory.
Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved.
Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our Semiconductor Test, System Test and Industrial Automation segments and the next four quarters for our Wireless Test segment, is written-down to estimated net realizable value.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, we recorded an inventory provision of $3.5 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels.
Of the $3.5 million of total excess and obsolete provisions, $2.2 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.8 million was related to Wireless Test, $0.3 million was related to System Test, and $0.2 million was related to Industrial Automation.
During the three months ended April 2, 2017, we recorded an inventory provision of $2.7 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels.
Of the $2.7 million of total excess and obsolete provisions, $1.3 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.9 million was related to System Test, and $0.5 million was related to Wireless Test.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, we scrapped $0.3 million and $1.8 million of inventory, respectively.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, we sold $2.2 million and $1.1 million of previously written-down or written-off inventory, respectively.
As of April 1, 2018, we had inventory related reserves for inventory which had been written-down or written-off totaling $103.4 million.
We have no pre-determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory.
The increase of $5.7 million in selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher spending in Industrial Automation.
Acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased primarily in the Industrial Automation segment due to intangible assets that became fully amortized in June 2017, partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the Energid acquisition.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, we recorded a $5.0 million credit for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability, partially offset by $3.9 million recorded for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test, and $0.8 million of acquisition related expenses.
During the three months ended April 2, 2017, we recorded $2.5 million of restructuring and other charges of which $1.3 million was for a lease impairment of a Wireless Test facility in Sunnyvale, CA, which was terminated in September 2017, $0.6 million was for employee severance charges and $0.6 million for the increase in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability.
Interest income increased by $2.5 million due primarily to higher cash and marketable securities balances during the quarter and higher interest rates in 2018.
Interest expense increased by $1.5 million due primarily to realized losses on sales of marketable securities.
Other (income) expense, net included net foreign exchange losses and non-service components of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs.
The decrease in income before income taxes in Semiconductor Test was driven primarily by lower gross margin due to product mix.
The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of system level testers.
The increase in income before income taxes in Industrial Automation was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms.
The decrease in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems.
The increase in the effective tax rate from the three months ended April 2, 2017 to the three months ended April 1, 2018 primarily resulted from a projected shift in the geographic distribution of income which increased income subject to taxation in the U.S. relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions and a reduction in discrete tax benefits recognized.
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances decreased by $316.1 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 to $1,588 million.
Operating activities during the three months ended April 1, 2018 used cash of $81.9 million.
Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $212.6 million.
This was due to a $162.4 million increase in operating assets and a $50.2 million decrease in operating liabilities.
The increase in operating assets was primarily due to a $140.7 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in shipments during the last month of the quarter and the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, a $21.0 million increase in inventories, and a $0.7 million increase in prepayments and other assets.
The decrease in operating liabilities was due to a $56.3 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to first quarter payments related to variable compensation, a $12.1 million decrease in income taxes, a $7.5 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, and $1.0 million of retirement plan contributions, partially offset by a $17.1 million increase in accounts payable and a $9.6 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advance payments.
Investing activities during the three months ended April 1, 2018 provided cash of $462.9 million, due to $800.7 million and $212.7 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, respectively, partially offset by $490.3 million used for purchases of marketable securities, $34.8 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment and $25.4 million used for the acquisition of Energid.
Operating activities during the three months ended April 2, 2017 used cash of $61.1 million.
Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $182.4 million.
This was due to a $184.9 million increase in operating assets and a $2.5 million increase in operating liabilities.
The increase in operating assets was primarily due to a $123.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to the delivery profile of first quarter shipments and a $62.2 million increase in inventories to support increased shipments in the second quarter.
The decrease in operating liabilities was due to a $31.0 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to first quarter payments related to variable compensation, a $3.3 million decrease in deferred revenue and customer advance payments, a $0.9 million decrease in other accrued liabilities and $0.9 million of retirement plan contributions, partially offset by a $24.3 million increase in accounts payable and a $14.3 million increase in income taxes.
Investing activities during the three months ended April 2, 2017 provided cash of $126.4 million, due to $213.6 million and $88.2 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, respectively, partially offset by $153.3 used for purchases of marketable securities and $22.1 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment.
In January 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share that was paid on March 23, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2018. Dividend payments for the three months ended April 1, 2018 were $17.6 million.
In January 2018, our Board of Directors cancelled the December 2016 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of common stock.
We intend to repurchase $750 million in 2018.
During the three months ended April 2, 2017, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock for $37.7 million at an average price of $29.38 per share.
While we declared a quarterly cash dividend and authorized a share repurchase program, we may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future.
We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend, execute our authorized share repurchase program and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months.
Inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings.
Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operations.
A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
