The consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of Teradyne and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Certain prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
The accompanying financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Teradynes Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 1, 2019, for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 Improvements, that allowed for a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of adoption.
Under this method of adoption, the comparative information in the consolidated financial statements has not been revised and continues to be reported under the previously applicable lease accounting guidance (ASC 840).
Teradyne also utilized the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance which included the carry-forward of historical lease classification.
Adoption of ASC 842 resulted in recording ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $50.1 million and $54.3 million, respectively.
Operating lease liabilities were calculated using the discount rate on January 1, 2019.
The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on beginning retained earnings, the consolidated statement of operations, cash flows, or earnings per share.
Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when Teradyne has the right to control the use of an identified asset.
Teradyne determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations.
As of March 31, 2019, Teradyne does not have material leases that have not yet commenced.
Teradyne determines if the lease is operating or finance at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset.
The lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.
As Teradyne is typically unable to determine the implicit rate, Teradyne uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment at commencement date.
Variable payments that do not depend on an index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred.
The ROU asset is initially measured as the amount of lease liability, adjusted for any initial lease costs, prepaid lease payments, and reduced by any lease incentives.
On January 30, 2019, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Lemsys SA (Lemsys) for a total purchase price of approximately $9.1 million.
Lemsys strengthens Teradynes position in the electrification trends of vehicles, solar, wind, and industrial applications.
As of the acquisition date, Teradynes preliminary purchase price allocation was goodwill of $1.2 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes, acquired intangible assets of $5.5 million with an average estimated useful life of 4.9 years, and $2.4 million of net tangible assets.
The acquisition was not material to Teradynes condensed consolidated financial statements.
On April 25, 2018, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Mobile Industrial Robots Aps (MiR), a Danish limited liability company located in Odense, Denmark.
MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications.
MiR is part of Teradynes Industrial Automation segment.
The contingent consideration is payable in Euros upon the achievement of certain thresholds and targets for revenue and earnings before interest and taxes for periods from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018; January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019; and January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020.
MiRs products will help expand the Industrial Automation segment, which is a key component of Teradynes growth strategy.
The allocation of the total purchase price to MiRs net tangible liabilities and identifiable intangible assets was based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.
Pro forma results for the three months ended April 1, 2018 were adjusted to exclude $0.6 million of acquisition related costs.
On February 26, 2018, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Energid Technologies Corporation (Energid) for a total purchase price of approximately $27.6 million.
As of the acquisition date, Teradynes purchase price allocation was goodwill of $14.4 million which is deductible for tax purposes, acquired intangible assets of $12.3 million with an average estimated useful life of 7.7 years, and $1.0 million of net tangible assets.
The acquisition was not material to Teradynes condensed consolidated financial statements.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, Teradyne also recognized $1.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of revenues from leases of Teradyne systems, which are accounted for outside of ASC 606.
The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and timing of revenue recognition.
The amount of revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018 that was previously included within the deferred revenue and customer advances balance was $19.5 million and $21.8 million, respectively, and primarily relates to extended warranties, training, application support, and post contract support.
Each of these represents a distinct performance obligation.
Teradyne expects to recognize 72% of the remaining performance obligation in the next 12 months, 22% in 1-3 years, and the remainder thereafter.
Teradyne sells certain trade accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements.
Teradyne accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as a cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring agreements were $41.7 million and $3.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, respectively.
Inventory reserves at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were $100.9 million and $100.8 million, respectively.
Teradyne considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
Teradynes available-for-sale debt securities are classified as Level 2 and equity securities are classified as Level 1.
Contingent consideration is classified as Level 3.
The vast majority of Level 2 securities are fixed income securities priced by third party pricing vendors.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 financial instruments.
Realized gains recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018 were $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
Realized losses recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018 were $0.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively.
Unrealized gains related to equity securities recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $2.8 million.
The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
The following table sets forth by fair value hierarchy Teradynes financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
In the three months ended March 31, 2019, the fair value of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of MiR was increased by $3.0 million.
In the three months ended April 1, 2018, the fair value of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of Universal Robots was decreased by $5.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in forecasted revenue.
As of March 31, 2019, the significant unobservable inputs used in the Monte Carlo simulation to fair value the MiR contingent consideration include forecasted revenues, revenue volatility, earnings before interest and taxes, and discount rate.
As of March 31, 2019, the maximum amount of contingent consideration that could be paid in connection with the acquisition of MiR is $83.2 million.
The remaining earn-out periods end on December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020.
The fair values of accounts receivable, net and accounts payable approximate the carrying value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
As of March 31, 2019, the fair market value of investments in available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses totaled $120.0 million.
Of this value, $32.9 million had unrealized losses of $1.3 million for greater than one year and $87.1 million had unrealized losses of $0.1 million for less than one year.
As of December 31, 2018, the fair market value of investments with unrealized losses totaled $192.0 million.
Of this value, $28.5 million had unrealized losses of $1.6 million greater than one year and $163.5 million had unrealized losses of $1.4 million for less than one year.
Teradyne reviews its investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment.
Contractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale securities held at March 31, 2019 exclude $3.3 million of debt mutual funds as they do not have a contractual maturity date.
The purpose of Teradynes foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
To minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, Teradyne enters into foreign currency forward contracts.
The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded directly in earnings, and is used to offset the change in value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $148.8 million and $163.1 million, respectively.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, net gains from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were $3.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Under this method of adoption, the comparative information in the consolidated financial statements has not been revised and continues to be reported under the previously applicable lease accounting guidance (ASC 840).
Adoption of ASC 842 resulted in recording ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $50.1 million and $54.3 million, respectively.
The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on beginning retained earnings, the consolidated statement of operations, cash flows, or earnings per share.
Teradynes facility leases are primarily used for administrative functions, research and development, manufacturing, and storage and distribution.
Remaining lease terms range from less than one year to ten years.
On December 12, 2016, Teradyne completed a private offering of $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior unsecured notes (the Notes) due December 15, 2023 and received net proceeds, after issuance costs, of approximately $450.8 million, $33.0 million of which was used to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge transactions and $50.1 million of which was used to repurchase 2.0 million shares of Teradynes common stock under its existing stock repurchase program from purchasers of the Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliates conducted concurrently with the pricing of the Note offering.
The Notes will mature on December 15, 2023, unless earlier repurchased or converted.
The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 14.5 million shares of Teradynes common stock.
Separately and concurrent with the pricing of the Notes, Teradyne entered into warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties (the Warrant Transactions) in which it sold net-share-settled (or, at its election subject to certain conditions, cash-settled) warrants to the Option Counterparties.
The Warrant Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 14.5 million shares of common stock.
The strike price is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.
The net cost of the Note Hedge Transactions, after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants, was approximately $33.0 million.
Teradyne considered the guidance of ASC 815-40, Derivatives and HedgingContracts in Entitys Own Equity, and concluded that the convertible note hedge is both indexed to Teradynes common stock and should be classified in stockholders equity in its statements of financial position.
 considered indexed to Teradynes common stock as the terms of the Note Hedge Transactions do not contain an exercise contingency and the settlement amount equals the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of Teradynes shares and a fixed strike price.
Teradyne analyzed the Warrant Transactions under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and HedgingContracts in Entitys Own Equity, and other relevant literature, and determined that it met the criteria for classification as an equity transaction and is considered indexed to Teradynes common stock.
As a result, Teradyne recorded the proceeds from the warrants as an increase to additional paid-in capital.
Teradyne does not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the warrants in its financial statements.
The provisions of ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, are applicable to the Notes.
ASC 470-20 requires Teradyne to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion feature) components of the Notes in a manner that reflects Teradynes nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods.
Teradyne allocated $100.8 million of the $460.0 million principal amount of the Notes to the equity component, which represents a discount to the debt and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method through December 2023.
Accordingly, Teradynes effective annual interest rate on the Notes will be approximately 5.0%.
Debt issuance costs of approximately $7.2 million are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the seven year term of the Notes.
As of March 31, 2019, debt issuance costs were approximately $5.1 million.
As of March 31, 2019, the remaining unamortized discount was $76.4 million, which will be amortized over 4.7 years using the effective interest rate method.
As of March 31, 2019, the if-converted value of the Notes was $578.1 million.
The Credit Agreement further provides that, subject to customary conditions, Teradyne may seek to obtain from existing or new lenders incremental commitments under the Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $150 million.
Proceeds from the Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes and working capital.
Teradyne incurred $2.3 million in costs related to the revolving credit facility.
As of May 10, 2019, Teradyne has not borrowed any funds under the Credit Facility.
The interest rates applicable to loans under the Credit Facility are, at Teradynes option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.00% per annum or LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00% per annum, based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of Teradyne and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
In addition, Teradyne will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitments under the Credit Facility ranging from 0.125% to 0.350% per annum, based on the then applicable Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
Teradyne is not required to repay any loans under the Credit Facility prior to maturity, subject to certain customary exceptions.
Teradyne is permitted to prepay all or any portion of the loans under the Credit Facility prior to maturity without premium or penalty, other than customary LIBOR breakage costs.
Teradyne generally provides a one-year warranty on its products, commencing upon installation, acceptance, delivery or shipment.
A provision is recorded upon revenue recognition to cost of revenues for estimated warranty expense based on historical experience.
When Teradyne receives revenue for extended warranties, beyond one year, it is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
The balance below is included in short and long-term deferred revenue and customer advances on the balance sheet.
Teradyne expenses the cost of the restricted stock unit awards subject to time-based vesting, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.
Teradyne grants performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to its executive officers with a performance metric based on relative total shareholder return (TSR).
Teradynes three-year TSR performance is measured against the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Composite Index.
The final number of TSR PRSUs that vest will vary based upon the level of performance achieved from 200% to 0% of the target shares capped at four times the grant date value.
The number of units expected to be earned, based upon the achievement of the TSR market condition, is factored into the grant date Monte Carlo valuation.
Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the three-year service period or the period from the grant to the date described in the retirement provisions below.
Compensation expense for employees meeting the retirement provisions prior to the grant date will be recognized in full on the date of the grant.
Compensation expense is reversed if at any time during the three-year service period the executive officer is no longer an employee, subject to the retirement and termination eligibility provisions noted below.
In January 2019 and 2018, Teradyne granted PRSUs to its executive officers with a performance metric based on three-year cumulative non-GAAP profit before interest and tax (PBIT) as a percent of Teradynes revenue.
The final number of PBIT PRSUs that vest will vary based upon the level of performance achieved from 200% to 0% of the target shares.
Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the three year service period or the period from the grant date to the date described in the retirement provisions below.
Compensation expense for employees meeting the retirement provisions prior to the grant date will be recognized in full on the date of grant.
Compensation expense is recognized based on the number of units that are earned based upon the three-year Teradyne PBIT as a percent of Teradynes revenue, provided the executive officer remains an employee at the end of the three-year period subject to the retirement and termination eligibility provisions noted below.
If a PRSU recipients employment ends prior to the determination of the performance percentage due to (1) permanent disability or death or (2) retirement or termination other than for cause, after attaining both at least age sixty and at least ten years of service, then all or a portion of the recipients PRSUs (based on the actual performance percentage achieved on the determination date) will vest on the date the performance percentage is determined.
Dividend yield was based upon an estimated annual dividend amount of $0.36 per share for 2019 grants and 2018 grants, divided by Teradynes stock price on the grant date of $36.75 for the 2019 grant and $47.70 for the 2018 grant.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, Teradyne granted 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively, of PBIT PRSUs with a grant date fair value of $35.67 and $46.62, respectively.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, Teradyne granted 0.6 million of service-based restricted stock unit awards to employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of $35.88 and 0.1 million of service-based stock options to executive officers at a weighted average grant date fair value of $10.26.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, Teradyne granted 0.5 million of service-based restricted stock unit awards to employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of $46.58 and 0.1 million of service-based stock options to executive officers at a weighted average grant date fair value of $12.17.
Stock options to purchase Teradynes common stock at 100% of the fair market value on the grant date vest in equal annual installments over four years from the grant date and have a maximum term of seven years.
Teradyne determined the stock options expected life based upon historical exercise data for executive officers, the age of the executive officers and the terms of the stock option grant.
Volatility was determined using historical volatility for a period equal to the expected life.
Dividend yield was based upon an estimated annual dividend amount of $0.36 per share for 2019 and 2018 grants divided by Teradynes stock price on the grant date of $36.75 for the 2019 grant and $47.70 for the 2018 grant.
Teradyne performs its annual goodwill impairment test as required under the provisions of ASC 350-10, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other on December 31 of each fiscal year unless interim indicators of impairment exist.
Goodwill is considered impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
Includes $5.5 million of intangible assets from Lemsys acquisition.
Aggregate intangible asset amortization expense was $10.6 million and $7.7 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, respectively.
Incremental shares from assumed conversion of the convertible notes was calculated using the difference between the average Teradyne stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.70, multiplied by 14.5 million shares.
The result of this calculation, representing the total intrinsic value of the convertible debt, was divided by the average Teradyne stock price for the period.
Convertible notes hedge warrant shares were calculated using the difference between the average Teradyne stock price for the period and the warrant price of $39.78, multiplied by 14.5 million shares.
The result of this calculation, representing the total intrinsic value of the warrant, was divided by the average Teradyne stock price for the period.
The computation of diluted net income per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2019 excludes the effect of the potential vesting of 0.6 million of restricted stock units because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
The pension asset or liability represents a difference between the fair value of the pension plans assets and the projected benefit obligation.
Benefits under these plans are based on employees years of service and compensation.
The assets of the U.S. qualified pension plan consist primarily of fixed income and equity securities.
In the three months ended March 31, 2019, Teradyne contributed $0.7 million to the U.S. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and $0.2 million to certain qualified pension plans for non-U.S. subsidiaries.
In addition to receiving pension benefits, Teradyne employees in the United States who meet early retirement eligibility requirements as of their termination dates may participate in Teradynes Welfare Plan, which includes medical and dental benefits up to age 65.
Substantially all of Teradynes current U.S. employees could become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was also reduced by discrete tax benefits from the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions.
The effective rate for the three months ended April 1, 2018 was also increased by additions to the uncertain tax positions for transfer pricing.
Discrete tax items recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2019 amounted to $30.2 million of net benefit.
As of March 31, 2019, Teradyne believes that it will ultimately realize the deferred tax assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Teradyne had $13.5 million and $43.4 million, respectively, of reserves for uncertain tax positions.
The $29.9 million net decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions is composed of reductions in uncertain tax positions amounting to $22.4 million related to transfer pricing and $7.4 million associated with U.S. research and development tax credits.
The estimated decrease is composed of reserves relating to local tax incentives.
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of interest and penalties were accrued for uncertain tax positions.
