right-of-use  (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for operating leases with terms longer than twelve months.
Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when we have the right to control the use of an identified asset.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations.
As of June 30, 2019, we do not have material leases that have not yet commenced.
We determine if the lease is operating or finance at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset.
As we are typically unable to determine the implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment at commencement date.
We initially measure payments based on an index by using the applicable rate at lease commencement.
Variable payments that do not depend on an index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred.
non-lease components as a single lease component.
For leases with a term of one year or less we elected not to record the lease asset or liability.
The lease payments are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
