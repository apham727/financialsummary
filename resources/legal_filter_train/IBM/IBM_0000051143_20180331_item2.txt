Item 2.
As a result, the company aligned its presentation of operating (non-GAAP) earnings to conform to the FASB presentation of these costs in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis.
The company filed a Form 8-K on March 29, 2018 to recast its historical consolidated and segment information to reflect the change.
Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year periods currency conversion rate.
Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.
The following table provides the companys (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017.
In the first quarter of 2018, the company reported $19.1 billion in revenue, $1.7 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $2.3 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.81 as reported and $2.45 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
The company also generated $4.6 billion in cash from operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter of 2018 and delivered shareholder returns of $2.2 billion through gross common stock repurchases and dividends.
Strategic imperatives revenue of $9.0 billion increased 15 percent as reported and 10 percent adjusted for currency in the first quarter, with double-digit growth in cloud, security and mobile, as the company continues to build new platforms and solutions and embeds cloud and AI capabilities across the business.
Strategic imperatives revenue over the last 12 months was $37.7 billion, an increase of 12 percent as reported and 10 percent adjusted for currency, representing 47 percent of the companys total revenue.
Total Cloud revenue in the first quarter of 2018 of $4.2 billion increased 20 percent as reported and 14 percent adjusted for currency, with as-a-Service revenue up 25 percent as reported and 20 percent adjusted for currency.
The annual exit run rate for as-a-Service revenue increased to $10.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $8.6 billion in the first quarter of 2017.
Analytics revenue of $4.8 billion increased 9 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency.
Mobile revenue increased 19 percent as reported and 14 percent adjusted for currency and Security revenue increased 65 percent (60 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting strong demand for the companys highly-integrated security software, security managed services and the pervasive encryption capabilities in the z14 mainframe, and growth in security software solutions.
The consolidated gross margin of 43.2 percent decreased 0.5 points year to year.
The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 43.7 percent decreased 0.7 points.
The consolidated gross margin and the operating (non-GAAP) gross margin performance improved sequentially 80 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, compared to the fourth-quarter 2017 year-to-year performance driven by an improved mix and productivity led by services.
Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion decreased 20.2 percent and the pre-tax margin was 6.0 percent, a decrease of 1.9 points year to year.
The continuing operations effective tax rate was (47.5) percent compared to (23.1) percent in the first quarter of 2017.
The prior year negative tax rate was primarily driven by discrete tax items ($0.5 billion), including the first-quarter 2017 intra-entity transfer of assets ($0.6 billion).
Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1.7 billion decreased 14.4 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 2.1 points to 9.1 percent.
Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $2.3 billion increased 2.1 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 11.9 percent, a decline of 0.3 points year to year.
The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2018 was (30.5) percent.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.81 decreased 2.2 percent year to year.
Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $2.45 increased 4.3 percent versus the first quarter of 2017.
· Decreases in total receivables ($3.1 billion); partially offset by
· Increases in deferred costs ($1.0 billion) driven by capitalized sales commissions ($0.7 billion) related to the adoption of the new revenue standard, prepaid expenses and other current assets ($0.7 billion) driven by contract assets, prepaid pension assets ($0.5 billion), marketable securities ($0.3 billion) and deferred taxes ($0.2 billion).
· Decreases in taxes ($0.8 billion), accounts payable ($0.7 billion) and total debt ($0.4 billion); partially offset by
· Increases in deferred income ($1.6 billion).
· Increases from net income ($1.7 billion), adoption of the new revenue standard ($0.5 billion) and retirement-related benefit plans ($0.5 billion); partially offset by
· Decreases from dividends ($1.4 billion) and share repurchases ($0.8 billion).
The company generated $4.6 billion in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of $0.6 billion compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven primarily by an increase in cash provided by working capital performance and financing receivables, partially offset by an increase in cash income tax payments.
Net cash used in investing activities of $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2018 was $2.1 billion higher than the prior year, primarily driven by net non-operating financing receivables ($1.7 billion).
The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018.
Free cash flow realization is expected to be in excess of 100 percent of GAAP net income.
Refer to page 70 in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information on this non-GAAP measure.
The following is an analysis of the first quarter of 2018 versus the first quarter of 2017 reportable segment external revenue and gross margin results.
Segment pre-tax income includes transactions between segments that are intended to reflect an arms-length transfer price and excludes certain unallocated corporate items.
Cognitive Solutions revenue of $4,299 million grew 5.8 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year as the company continued to scale new platforms and solutions and increase its SaaS offerings.
There was year-to-year growth in both Solutions Software and Transaction Processing Software on an as-reported and constant currency basis.
Solutions Software revenue of $2,957 million grew 5.9 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, led by offerings in analytics and security.
Within analytics, year-to-year growth, as reported and adjusted for currency, was driven by strong transactional performance.
The company remains well positioned in this market and continues to increase its AI capabilities across its extensive security portfolio.
Transaction Processing Software revenue of $1,341 million grew 5.7 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year.
Growth was driven by Z middleware, as clients continue to invest and grow their high-value, mission-critical workloads on the Z platform.
Cognitive Solutions total strategic imperatives revenue of $2.8 billion grew 6 percent year to year as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency).
Pre-tax income of $1,333 million increased 5.1 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year.
While the pre-tax margin declined 0.3 points to 26.2 percent, this included an impact of 1.8 points from higher workforce rebalancing charges in the current year.
Global Business Services revenue of $4,174 million grew 4.2 percent as reported (decreased 1 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year.
These results reflect modest improvement in the year-to-year performance compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
As the company continues to transform this business, GBS signings grew again in the quarter, both as reported and adjusted for currency.
There was growth year to year in strategic imperatives revenue reflecting the ongoing shift to areas of higher client value, such as cloud and analytics.
This performance was led by the Digital Strategy and iX business, which implements end-to-end digital transformation strategies for clients.
Global Process Services revenue of $305 million decreased 2.9 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the first quarter of the prior year.
Application Management revenue of $2,002 million grew 4.1 percent as reported (decreased 2 percent adjusted for currency) and reflected sequential improvement from the year-to-year performance in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Within GBS, total strategic imperatives revenue of $2.5 billion grew 12 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) year to year.
Cloud revenue of $1.0 billion grew 19 percent as reported (12 percent adjusted for currency), with an as-a-Service exit run rate of $1.2 billion.
GBS gross profit margin stabilized in the first quarter, decreasing 0.1 points year to year to 23.3 percent with a 1.9 point improvement in trajectory from the fourth quarter of 2017.
This stabilization was driven by productivity, revenue mix and pricing improvements.
Pre-tax income of $145 million decreased 48.6 percent year to year.
The pre-tax margin declined 3.5 points to 3.4 percent which included an impact of 1.9 points from a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges in the current year.
Overall, this performance reflects the companys ongoing investments in the next generation of offerings, skills and enablement, and reshaping of its pyramids for each of the core service lines which will drive operating leverage in the long term.
Technical Support Services revenue of $1,782 million grew 1.2 percent as reported (decreased 4 percent adjusted for currency) year to year due in part to the hardware cycle dynamics, offset by growth in core multi-vendor support services.
Integration Software first-quarter revenue of $1,019 million grew 5.1 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, with continued strong growth in SaaS offerings across the portfolio and the companys new IBM Cloud Private offering.
This portfolio remains essential to clients as they connect multiple environments through a single architecture.
The estimated total services backlog at March 31, 2018 was $121 billion, an increase of 4.2 percent as reported (decrease of 2 percent adjusted for currency).
There was growth in Global Technology Services backlog as reported, but a decrease year to year adjusted for currency.
Services signings are managements initial estimate of the value of a clients commitment under a services contract.
There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings.
The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.
Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value.
Contract portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for initial signings.
The company has modernized its systems for the most contemporary workloads and, within Systems Hardware, revenue of $1,093 million grew 9.2 percent year to year as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency).
Operating Systems Software revenue of $407 million grew 3.2 percent as reported (decreased 1 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year.
The adoption of the z14 was again broad based with new clients added to the platform across several countries during the quarter.
The company continues to address emerging workloads across the Z platform including blockchain, machine learning, dev ops and payments.
The new z14 model, designed specifically for cloud environments, was recently announced bringing the power of IBM Z to a broader set of clients.
Power Systems grew for the second consecutive quarter with revenue up 6.1 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, driven by the entry-level portfolio and cloud-enabled offerings.
Power Systems remain vital to many workloads and during the first quarter, the company began shipping POWER 9 entry systems which are designed for AIX, IBM i and Linux workloads.
These cloud-ready systems provide leadership capabilities in advanced analytics, cloud environments and data intensive AI workloads.
There were also sales execution challenges that impacted performance in the first quarter of 2018.
Within Systems, total strategic imperatives revenue of $0.7 billion grew 28 percent as reported (24 percent adjusted for currency) year to year in the first quarter of 2018.
The Systems gross profit margin decreased 3.8 points to 43.7 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year.
The year-to-year decrease was driven by actions taken in the quarter to better position the systems cost structure over the longer term which impacted margin by 4.9 points.
This was partially offset by a benefit from product mix, primarily toward the higher margin IBM Z.
The pre-tax loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $203 million compared with $188 million in the prior year.
Global Financing facilitates IBM clients acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating strong returns on equity.
Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients.
Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.
The gross profit margin on used sales was 59.0 percent and 51.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Global Financing pre-tax income increased 21.3 percent to $377 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to higher gross profit of $59 million and a decrease in total expenses of $7 million.
Global Financing return on equity was 32.5 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 25.2 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in return on equity in the first quarter was due to an increase in annualized after-tax income.
Refer to page 72 for the details of the after-tax income and return on equity calculation.
Total unguaranteed residual value of leases was $671 million as of March 31, 2018.
In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
Third-party residual value guarantees increase the minimum lease payments as provided for by accounting standards that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease.
The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were $21 million and $43 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of direct financing leases were $48 million and $34 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The associated aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease were $3 million for the financing transactions originated during each of the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
Americas revenue of $8,707 million was flat as reported and adjusted for currency.
EMEA revenue of $6,176 million increased 13.6 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency.
Within Americas, the U.S. decreased 2.0 percent compared to the prior year.
Latin America increased 5.4 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency.
Within Latin America, Brazil increased 4.9 percent as reported and 8 percent adjusted for currency.
Mexico increased 3.9 percent as reported, but declined 1 percent adjusted for currency.
In EMEA, France increased 24.6 percent and 8 percent adjusted for currency and Spain increased 28.9 percent and 12 percent adjusted for currency, compared to the same period in the prior year.
Germany increased 11.5 percent as reported, but declined 3 percent adjusted for currency and the UK increased 10.2 percent as reported, but decreased 2 percent adjusted for currency.
The Middle East and Africa region increased 9.3 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency.
Within Asia Pacific, Japan increased 4.3 percent as reported, but declined 1 percent adjusted for currency, while China increased 8.8 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency.
· Lower spending (2 points).
Bad debt expense decreased $2 million year to year.
The receivables provision coverage was 1.7 percent at March 31, 2018, an increase of 10 basis points from December 31, 2017 and a decrease of 50 basis points from March 31, 2017.
· The effects of currency (2 points).
The company entered into new partnership agreements in the first three months of 2018, which included one transaction with period income greater than $100 million.
There was also one transaction greater than $100 million in the first quarter of 2017.
The company licenses IP to partners who allocate their skills to extend the value of assets that are high value, but may be in mature markets.
· Higher interest income ($40 million).
The year-to-year change was driven primarily by the same factors above, excluding the higher non-operating retirement-related costs.
Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business.
Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) for the first quarter of 2018 was $347 million, an increase of $54 million year to year, primarily driven by a higher average debt balance and higher average interest rates.
Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $63 million compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by lower expected return on plan assets ($48 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($42 million); partially offset by lower interest costs ($40 million).
As discussed in the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section on page 50, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating.
Non-operating costs of $402 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased $55 million year to year, driven primarily by lower expected return on plan assets ($48 million), an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($42 million), partially offset by lower interest costs ($40 million).
Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
Actual shares outstanding at March 31, 2018 were 918.0 million.
The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during the first quarter of 2018 were 22.4 million shares lower than the first quarter of 2017.
Cash, marketable securities and restricted cash at quarter end were $13,155 million.
The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives.
Total debt of $46,387 million decreased $437 million from December 31, 2017, driven by debt maturities of $3,298 million, partially offset by new debt issuances of $2,198 million.
Within total debt, $31,667 million, or approximately 68 percent, is in support of the Global Financing business.
The company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its credit facilities.
The assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of the companys financial position.
At March 31, 2018, substantially all client and commercial financing assets were IT related assets, and approximately 53 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers.
investment grade year to year (1 point) was driven primarily by rating changes within the existing portfolio, not by changing the companys approach to the market.
This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio.
The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigating actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees, non-recourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease.
Adjusting for the mitigation actions, the investment grade content would increase by 17 points to 70 percent, an increase of 4 points year to year.
· An increase of $713 million ($653 million adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the reclassification from receivables.
· An increase in deferred income of $1,507 million ($1,346 adjusted for currency) primarily due to the cyclical increase in annual billings.
The total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.7 percent at March 31, 2018, an increase of 10 basis points compared to December 31, 2017.
The majority of the write-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2018 related to Global Financing receivables, which had been previously reserved.
The following table presents external Global Financing receivables excluding residual values, and the allowance for credit losses, and including miscellaneous receivables.
The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved increased from 1.1 percent at December 31, 2017, to 1.2 percent at March 31, 2018.
The increase was driven by additional provisions of $4 million and by the overall decline in gross receivables, partially offset by write-offs of $6 million of receivables previously reserved.
Specific reserves decreased 1 percent from $258 million at December 31, 2017, to $255 million at March 31, 2018.
Unallocated reserves increased 10 percent from $78 million at December 31, 2017, to $86 million at March 31, 2018.
Global Financings bad debt expense was $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $10 million for the same period in 2017.
· A decrease of $694 million in long-term financing receivables ($810 million adjusted for currency) reflecting seasonal reductions from higher year-end balances.
· Current upcoming maturities of long-term debt of $1,742 million.
The companys funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to manage the overall asset and liability profile.
Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed.
Total debt of $46,387 million decreased $437 million from December 31, 2017.
Non-Global Financing debt of $14,709 million was down $681 million from December 31, 2017 and up $403 million from March 31, 2017.
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt.
The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing.
Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units.
As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 58 and in note 7, Segments, on page 35.
In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
Total equity increased by $565 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases from net income ($1,679 million), adoption of the new revenue standard ($524 million) and retirement-related plans ($537 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends ($1,382 million) and gross common share repurchases ($827 million).
These amounts include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business.
· An increase in net non-operating financing receivables of $1,659 million, primarily due to an increase in commercial financing volumes and changing business dynamics within OEM payables.
· A decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases of $516 million.
The companys strategies, investments and actions are all made with an objective of optimizing long-term performance.
A long-term perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the major shifts in technology, business and the global economy.
Over the long term, in consideration of the opportunities it will continue to develop, the company expects to have the ability to generate low single-digit revenue growth, and with a higher-value business mix, high single-digit operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share growth, with free cash flow realization of GAAP net income over 90 percent.
Over the last several years, the company has been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into its offerings while building new solutions and modernizing its existing platforms.
These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend the companys innovation leadership into the future.
The companys key differentiators are built around three pillars - innovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model.
A high level of investment is important as the company continues to build its capabilities in AI, cloud, security and blockchain, among others.
The actions taken in the first-quarter 2018 to reposition the business are aligned with this strategy.
The company expects the annualized gross savings from the first-quarter workforce rebalancing actions to deliver two times the investment, with approximately 50 percent of that savings in the second-half 2018.
There is a mix headwind from the mainframe cycle expected in the second half.
This is all taken into account in the full-year expectations.
Overall, the company expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for 2018 to be at least $11.58; excluding acquisition-related charges of $0.78 per share, non-operating retirement-related items of $1.32 per share and U.S. tax reform related-charges of $0.12 per share, operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share is expected to be at least $13.80.
For the first half of 2018, the company expects operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share to be approximately 40 percent of the full-year expectation, which is a point better than the first-half skew in 2017.
Free cash flow realization, which is defined as free cash flow to income from continuing operations (GAAP), is expected to be over 100%.
The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018.
Free cash flow expectations include a year-to-year headwind from strong receivables collections in 2017, an approximate $600 million year-to-year headwind from cash tax payments and an expected increase in capital expenditures.
The company expects its operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2018 to be 16 percent, plus or minus 2 points (excluding discrete items), which is a 4-point headwind year to year.
The company expects 2018 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $3.2 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million compared to 2017.
This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2017.
Consistent with the newly adopted FASB guidance for the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2017.
Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million compared to 2017, driven by lower income from expected return on assets and a year-to-year impact due to the pension obligation adjustment resulting from the successful resolution of the UK pension litigation matter in 2017.
Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2018, approximately flat compared to 2017.
At March 31, 2018, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars than at year-end 2017.
The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions.
References to adjusted for currency or constant currency reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula.
However, this constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates.
Based on the currency rate movements in the first three months of 2018, total revenue increased 5.1 percent as reported and was flat at constant currency versus the first three months of 2017.
The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $10 million in the first three months of 2017 on both an as-reported basis and an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars.
In the companys 2017 Annual Report, on pages 67 to 70, there is a discussion of the companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of data.
For the three months ended, or as of, as applicable, March 31, 2018, those amounts are $4.6 billion for net cash from operating activities, $13.2 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $15.3 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
The major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at March 31, 2018 appear in the table below.
The ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2017.
The companys contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade.
At March 31, 2018, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $352 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the companys outstanding instruments and market conditions.
For the purpose of running its business, the company manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different manner.
The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures.
The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software.
A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth.
Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency.
from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.
Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows.
As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow.
The increase was driven by performance in working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes and higher capital expenditures.
Net capital investments of $0.9 billion increased $0.1 billion year to year.
In the first three months of 2018, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $1.4 billion in dividends and $0.8 billion in gross common stock repurchases (5.0 million shares).
With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of approximately $400 million in 2018.
Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2018.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status.
In 2018, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit plans.
The companys U.S. operations generate substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity options available.
These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany loans with certain foreign subsidiaries.
Refer to the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section on page 50 for the companys rationale for presenting operating earnings information.
The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
The companys management evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
