Item 2. 
The following table provides the companys (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the third quarter of 2018 and 2017. 
In the third quarter of 2018, the company reported $18.8 billion in revenue, $2.7 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $3.1 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.94 as reported and $3.42 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The consolidated gross margin of 46.9 percent and operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 47.4 percent were each flat compared to the prior year, representing the companys strongest year-to-year gross margin performance in three years. The company generated $4.2 billion in cash from operations and $2.2 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter of 2018, and delivered shareholder returns of $2.1 billion through gross common stock repurchases and dividends. These results reflect the companys ability to deliver differentiated value through innovative technologies with the skills and expertise to implement these technologies. 
Total consolidated revenue decreased 2.1 percent as reported but was flat adjusted for currency in the third quarter, with continued growth in offerings in hybrid cloud, security, digital, analytics and AI. 
Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $3.0 billion decreased 2.2 percent and the pre-tax margin was 16.0 percent, flat year to year. The continuing operations effective tax rate was 10.2 percent compared to 11.0 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Income from continuing operations of $2.7 billion decreased 1.3 percent and the net income margin was 14.4 percent, an increase from 14.2 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Net income of $2.7 billion decreased 1.2 percent year to year. 
Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $3.6 billion increased 0.5 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations increased 0.5 points to 19.2 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $3.1 billion increased 2.9 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 16.7 percent, an increase of 0.8 points year to year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2018 was 12.8 percent, a decline of 2.0 points. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.94 increased 0.7 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $3.42 increased 4.9 percent versus the third quarter of 2017. In the third quarter of 2018, the company 
repurchased 4.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $0.6 billion and had $1.4 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization at September 30, 2018. 
The company continues to expect GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of at least $11.60 and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $13.80 per diluted share for 2018. The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018. Free cash flow realization is expected to be in excess of 100 percent of GAAP net income. Refer to page 89 in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information on this non-GAAP measure. Refer to the Looking Forward section on pages 86 and 87 for additional information on the companys expectations. 
In the first nine months of 2018, the company reported $57.8 billion in revenue, and delivered $6.8 billion in income from continuing operations, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.36 as reported and $8.96 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company generated $11.1 billion in cash from operations and $5.4 billion in free cash flow in the first nine months of 2018 and delivered shareholder returns of $6.6 billion through gross common stock repurchases and dividends. 
Total consolidated revenue increased 2.2 percent year to year as reported and 0.4 percent adjusted for currency in the first nine months of 2018. The company continued to have solid revenue growth in its strategic imperatives, led by cloud and security. 
In the first nine months of 2018, the companys strategic imperatives revenue increased 12 percent year to year as reported and 10 percent adjusted for currency. Total cloud revenue in the first nine months of 2018 of $13.5 billion increased 17 percent year to year as reported and 15 percent adjusted for currency, with as-a-Service revenue up 24 percent (22 percent adjusted for currency). Analytics revenue of $15.3 billion increased 5 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency. Mobile revenue increased 9 percent year to year (7 percent adjusted for currency) and Security revenue increased 57 percent as reported (56 percent adjusted for currency). 
From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue declined 0.3 percent year to year as reported and was flat adjusted for currency with a modest decline in the U.S. There was growth in Canada as reported and adjusted for currency, while Latin America declined as reported but grew year to year adjusted for currency. EMEA increased 6.9 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency with growth as reported and adjusted for currency in Germany, France, the UK and Spain. Asia Pacific increased 1.0 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency, with Japan up 2.1 percent as reported and flat adjusted for currency. China was flat as reported (declined 2 percent adjusted for currency) and India declined as reported and adjusted for currency. 
Total expense and other (income) increased $0.4 billion or 2.0 percent in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year increase included a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges (2 points), an impact from currency (2 points) and a lower level of IP income (1 points), partially offset by lower spending (3 points) driven by operating efficiencies, including acquisition synergies. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 1.3 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors. 
Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $6.9 billion decreased 0.3 percent and the pre-tax margin was 11.9 percent, a decrease of 0.3 points versus the first nine months of 2017. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 was 2.0 percent compared to 1.7 percent in the prior year. The tax rate in the first nine months of 2018 was primarily driven by the first-quarter resolution of certain U.S. tax audit matters and a net discrete tax benefit in the third quarter. The prior year tax rate was primarily driven by discrete tax items in the first half of the year. Income from continuing operations of $6.8 billion decreased 0.6 percent and the net income margin was 11.7 percent, a decrease of 0.3 points compared to the first nine months of 2017. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $7 million in the first nine months of 2018 versus a loss of $3 million in the prior-year period. Net income of $6.8 billion decreased 0.5 percent year to year. 
Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $8.7 billion increased 0.7 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 0.2 points to 15.1 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $8.2 billion increased 2.6 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 14.2 percent increased 0.1 points. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the first nine months of 2018 was 5.4 percent versus 7.2 percent in the first nine months of 2017. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.36 increased 1.7 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $8.96 increased 4.9 percent versus the prior year. In the first nine months of 2018, the company repurchased 16.0 million shares of its common stock and had $1.4 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization at September 30, 2018. 
· Decreases in total receivables ($6.1 billion), and net intangible assets ($0.6 billion); partially offset by 
· Increases in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities ($1.8 billion), and retirement plan assets ($1.0 billion). 
· Increases from net income ($6.8 billion), retirement-related benefit plans ($1.6 billion) and adoption of the new revenue standard ($0.5 billion); partially offset by 
· Decreases from dividends ($4.2 billion) and share repurchases ($2.4 billion). 
related to acquisitions ($0.3 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $5.9 billion increased $0.4 billion compared to the first nine months of 2017, driven by a decrease in net cash sourced from debt transactions ($1.5 billion); partially offset by a decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases ($1.3 billion). 
Cognitive Solutions revenue of $4,148 million decreased 5.7 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year, with declines in Solutions Software and Transaction Processing Software. For the first nine months of the year, Cognitive Solutions revenue of $13,027 million was flat as reported, but declined 1 percent adjusted for currency, with growth in Solutions Software as reported, but declined adjusted for currency. Transaction Processing Software revenue declined both as reported and adjusted for currency. 
In the third quarter, Solutions Software revenue of $2,910 million decreased 4.0 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency. There was good performance in the quarter in strategic verticals such as health, domain-specific capabilities including security solutions and key strategic areas of analytics, and in the emerging technologies of AI and blockchain. The performance in these key areas was more than offset by transition in other areas, including collaboration, 
commerce and talent, as the company continues to respond to secular shifts in the market by modernizing offerings, infusing AI and enhancing the digital experience. Transaction Processing Software revenue of $1,238 million decreased 9.7 percent as reported and 8 percent adjusted for currency. The year-to-year performance was impacted by strong results in third quarter 2017. This software runs mission-critical workloads, leveraging IBM hardware platforms, and performance is often tied to client buying cycles. Across the platforms, declines in Storage and IBM Z middleware software were partially offset by growth in Power Systems middleware. 
In the third quarter, pre-tax income of $1,629 million decreased 0.9 percent compared to the prior year with a pre-tax margin improvement of 1.3 points to 34.0 percent. For the first nine months of the year, pre-tax income of $4,718 million increased 4.3 percent compared to the prior year with a pre-tax margin improvement of 1.0 points to 31.1 percent. Pre-tax margins improved, driven by operational efficiencies, including acquisition synergies, even as the company continues to invest at high levels in key strategic areas, including AI, security and blockchain. 
Global Business Services revenue of $4,130 million increased 0.9 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. The company has realigned its practice model around key growth platforms including digital transformation, cloud applications and cognitive processes. For the first nine months of the year, Global Business Services revenue of $12,495 million increased 2.4 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency. 
In the third quarter, Consulting revenue of $1,900 million increased 5.4 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency, led by growth in offerings within Digital Strategy, iX and Cognitive Process Transformation. Clients are leveraging IBMs leading-edge technology portfolio and industry expertise to enable their digital transformation. Global Process Services (GPS) revenue of $314 million was flat as reported and increased 2 percent adjusted for currency. Application Management revenue of $1,915 million decreased 3.1 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency with decline in traditional enterprise application managed services partially offset by growth in strategic offerings, such as Cloud Migration Factory. 
Technical Support Services (TSS) third-quarter revenue of $1,707 million decreased 5.2 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency. TSS revenue continues to be impacted by the dynamics of the IBM Z product cycle as clients move from maintenance to warranty for the first year, partially offset by continued growth in core multi-vendor support services. 
In the third-quarter 2018, Integration Software revenue of $990 million was flat as reported and grew 1 percent adjusted for currency driven by offerings that assist clients with the modernization, automation and integration of their applications within a hybrid cloud environment, including strong adoption of IBM Cloud Private. 
percent and pre-tax margin decreased 1.9 points to 9.2 percent. The pre-tax margin in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the prior year included an impact of 0.9 points from a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges in the first quarter of 2018. 
The estimated total services backlog at September 30, 2018 was $113 billion, a decrease of 5.4 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency). Global Technology Services (GTS) backlog and GBS backlog declined year to year as reported and adjusted for currency. 
Total services backlog includes Infrastructure Services, Consulting, Global Process Services, Application Management and Technical Support Services. Total backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract which is either non-cancellable, or which historically has very low likelihood of termination, given the criticality of certain services to the companys clients. Total backlog does not include as-a-Service arrangements that allow for termination under contractual commitment terms. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency. 
Signings include Infrastructure Services, Consulting, Global Process Services and Application Management contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Technical Support Services (TSS) are generally not included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal renewals. Certain longer-term TSS contracts that have characteristics similar to outsourcing contracts are included in signings. 
Systems revenue of $1,736 million increased 0.9 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. Systems Hardware revenue of $1,339 million grew 3.0 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) driven by continued adoption of z14 and double-digit growth in Power Systems, offset by a decline in Storage Systems, as reported and adjusted for currency. Operating Systems Software revenue of $397 million decreased 5.6 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. For the first nine months of 2018, Systems revenue of $5,412 million increased 11.3 percent as reported (10 percent adjusted for currency) with strong growth in Systems Hardware, driven by z14 which continues to track ahead of prior cycles and Power Systems, partially offset by declines in Storage Systems and Operating Systems Software. 
Within Systems Hardware, third quarter IBM Z revenue grew 5.2 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency), driven by new workload MIPS. The z14 adoption remained broad based, across many countries and industries, and revenue increased year to year despite the strong growth in the prior year. The pervasive encryption capabilities of the z14 continues to be a key differentiator, as new clients were again added to the platform during the third quarter. 
Power Systems revenue grew 15.9 percent as reported (17 percent adjusted for currency), driven by strong growth in Linux and good performance across the new POWER9-based architecture. New POWER9 processors for mid-range and high-end systems were launched in the third quarter which are designed for handling advanced analytics, cloud environments and data intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX markets. During the third quarter, the company continued to deliver the most powerful commercially available supercomputers built with POWER9 technology to U.S. Department of Energy labs. 
Third-quarter Systems strategic imperatives revenue of $0.9 billion grew 5 percent year to year both as reported and adjusted for currency. Cloud revenue of $0.6 billion declined 9 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency). For the first nine months of the year, Systems strategic imperatives revenue of $2.9 billion increased 29 percent as reported (28 percent adjusted for currency), primarily due to the strong acceptance of the z14. Cloud revenue of $1.9 billion increased 12 percent as reported and 10 percent adjusted for currency. 
In the third quarter of 2018, pre-tax income of $209 million declined 37.9 percent and pre-tax margin decreased 6.4 points year to year to 10.9 percent, driven primarily by a lower level of IP income and continuing investment to drive innovation across the portfolio. For the first nine months of the year, pre-tax income of $352 million increased $131 million and pre-tax margin increased 1.8 points year to year to 5.9 percent, primarily due to the IBM Z product cycle, partially offset by the first-quarter actions taken to improve the systems cost structure over the longer term. 
Global Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity. Global Financing facilitates IBM clients acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a lease, surplus internal equipment and used equipment purchased externally. Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio. 
In the third quarter of 2018, Global Financing total revenue of $726 million increased 4.0 percent compared to the prior year. External revenue decreased 9.0 percent as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency), due to a decrease in used equipment sales (down 41.5 percent to $82 million), partially offset by an increase in financing (up 7.0 percent to $306 million). Internal revenue increased 24.5 percent, driven by an increase in used equipment sales (up 23.9 percent to $228 million), and an increase in financing (up 25.7 percent to $110 million). 
The year-to-year increases in internal financing revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were due to higher asset yields and higher average asset balances. The increases in external financing revenue in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, compared to the same periods in 2017, respectively, were due to higher average asset balances, partially offset by lower asset yields. 
Global Financing pre-tax income increased 26.9 percent to $308 million in the third quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to higher gross profit of $58 million and a decrease in expense of $7 million. Pre-tax income increased 24.8 percent to $1,042 million in the first nine months of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to higher gross profit of $212 million, partially offset by an increase in expense of $5 million. 
Global Financing return on equity was 27.5 percent and 30.5 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to 23.8 percent and 24.5 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. The increase in return on equity in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, compared to the same periods of 2017, was due to the increase in net income. Refer to page 90 for the details of the after-tax income and return on equity calculation. 
Total unguaranteed residual value of leases, including operating leases, was $663 million as of September 30, 2018. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease. Third-party residual value guarantees increase the minimum lease payments as provided for by accounting standards that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were $57 million and $79 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $212 million and $186 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
In the third quarter, total revenue of $18,756 million decreased 2.1 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. Americas revenue of $8,853 million decreased 0.9 percent as reported, but grew 1 percent adjusted for currency. EMEA revenue of $5,827 million decreased 3.0 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency. Asia Pacific revenue of $4,076 million decreased 3.3 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency. 
Within Americas, U.S. revenue increased 0.2 percent compared to the prior year. Canada increased 0.7 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency. Latin America decreased 8.6 percent as reported, but grew 3 percent adjusted for currency. Within Latin America, Brazil decreased 14.5 percent as reported, but was flat adjusted for currency. 
Within Asia Pacific, Japan was flat as reported and adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. Australia was flat as reported, but grew 8 percent adjusted for currency. India decreased 21.4 percent (14 percent adjusted for currency) and China decreased 4.2 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency). 
· The effects of currency (2 points). 
Operating (non-GAAP) expense decreased 5.1 percent year to year driven primarily by the same factors. 
· Lower spending (4 points). 
Operating (non-GAAP) expense was flat year to year driven primarily by the same factors. 
Bad debt expense increased $16 million year to year in the first nine months of 2018. The receivables provision coverage was 1.9 percent at September 30, 2018, an increase of 30 basis points compared to December 31, 2017 and flat compared to September 30, 2017. 
· Higher net exchange gains ($21 million). 
Operating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense was income of $115 million in the third quarter of 2018 and was flat year to year driven by the same factors as above, excluding the higher non-operating retirement-related costs. 
Operating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense was income of $219 million in the first nine months of 2018, a decrease of 2.8 percent year to year. The year-to-year change was driven primarily by the same factors as above, excluding the higher non-operating retirement-related costs. 
In the third quarter of 2018, total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $101 million compared to the third quarter of 2017, primarily driven by lower expected return on plan assets ($89 million) and an increase in other costs ($90 million) driven by a pension obligation adjustment recorded in the prior year related to the UK pension litigation; partially offset by lower interest costs ($69 million). Total cost for the first nine months of 2018 increased by $203 million versus the first nine months of 2017, primarily driven by lower expected return on plan assets ($203 million), an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($70 million) and an increase in other costs ($92 million) driven by the prior year pension obligation adjustment; partially offset by lower interest costs ($162 million). 
As discussed in the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section on page 58, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the third quarter of 2018 were $365 million, a decrease of $15 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 and non-operating costs were $389 million increasing $116 million year to year. For the first nine months of 2018, operating retirement-related costs were $1,115 million, a decrease of $13 million compared to the prior year and non-operating costs were $1,185 million increasing $216 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the prior year driven primarily by the same factors as above. 
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 10.2 percent, a decrease of 0.9 points compared to the third quarter of 2017. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 was 2.0 percent, an increase of 0.3 points compared to the first nine months of 2017. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the third quarter was 12.8 percent, a decrease of 2.0 points compared to the third quarter of 2017. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 was 5.4 percent, a decrease of 1.8 points compared to the first nine months of 2017. 
The decrease in the continuing operations effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a net discrete tax benefit primarily attributable to a tax incentive claim approved by the IRS in the quarter (4.8 points) and a more favorable mix of geographic income year to year (1.7 points). These benefits were partially offset by a decrease in foreign tax credits (4.6 points) as well as the net impact of audit activity in the third quarter (1.0 points). The decrease in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was driven by the same factors. 
At September 30, 2018, the balance sheet remained strong and the company continues to have the financial flexibility to support the business for the long term. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $14,662 million. The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives. Total debt of $46,921 million increased $97 million from December 31, 2017, driven by new debt issuances of $2,756 million and an increase in commercial paper of $2,490 million; partially offset by debt maturities of $4,243 million. Within total debt, $30,367 million, or approximately 65 percent, is in support of the Global Financing business. In the first nine months of 2018, the company generated $11,128 million in cash from operations, compared to $10,991 million in the first nine months of 2017. The company has consistently generated strong cash flows from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its credit facilities. 
The assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of the companys financial position. The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are the consolidated amounts including Global Financing. 
At September 30, 2018, substantially all client and commercial financing assets were IT related assets, and approximately 55 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers. This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio. 
The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigating actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees, non-recourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. Adjusting for the mitigation actions, the investment grade content would increase by 15 points to 69 percent, an increase of 2 points year to year. 
· An increase of $528 million ($611 million adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the reclassification of certain trade receivables upon adoption of the new revenue standard. 
· An increase in short-term debt of $3,945 million ($4,019 million adjusted for currency) primarily as a result of reclassifications of $5,264 million from long-term debt to reflect upcoming maturities and an increase in commercial paper of $2,490 million partially offset by maturities of $3,808 million. 
The total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.9 percent at September 30, 2018, an increase of 30 basis points compared to December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by the overall decline in gross receivables. 
The following table presents external Global Financing receivables excluding residual values, the allowance for credit losses and immaterial miscellaneous receivables. 
The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved increased from 1.1 percent at December 31, 2017, to 1.2 percent at September 30, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the overall decline in gross receivables. Specific reserves decreased 2 percent from $258 million at December 31, 2017, to $252 million at September 30, 2018. Unallocated reserves decreased 6 percent from $78 million at December 31, 2017, to $73 million at September 30, 2018. 
Global Financings bad debt expense was a release of $6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to a $1 million release for the same period in 2017 due to lower unallocated allowance requirements. 
Global Financings bad debt expense was $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $14 million in the prior year, due to higher specific allowance requirements in 2018. 
· An increase in retirement plan assets of $1,012 million ($1,111 million adjusted for currency) driven by the expected returns on plan assets, partially offset by interest costs. 
· A decrease in retirement and nonpension postretirement liabilities of $946 million driven by a currency impact of $405 million. 
The companys funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to manage the overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed. 
Total debt of $46,921 million increased $97 million from December 31, 2017, driven by new debt issuances of $2,756 million and an increase in commercial paper of $2,490 million; partially offset by debt maturities of $4,243 million. 
Non-Global Financing debt of $16,554 million was up $1,164 million from December 31, 2017 and up $319 million from September 30, 2017. 
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. 
Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 72 and in note 7, Segments, on pages 37 and 38. In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense. 
Total equity increased by $2,194 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases from net income ($6,777 million), an increase in retirement-related amounts ($1,648 million) and transition adjustments related to the adoption of the new revenue standard ($524 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends ($4,250 million) and an increase in treasury stock ($2,489 million) primarily due to share repurchases. 
The companys cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 7, are summarized in the following table. These amounts include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business.

The companys strategies, investments and actions are all made with an objective of optimizing long-term performance. A long-term perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the major shifts in technology, business and the global economy. 
Over the last several years, the company has been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into its offerings while building new solutions and modernizing its existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend the companys innovation leadership into the future. The companys key differentiators are built around three pillars - innovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model. 
The companys performance in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 reflects the investments that have been made and actions taken to reposition the business, further align the companys skills base to opportunity and drive operating efficiencies. The company has been rebuilding its innovation pipeline in order to address the areas enterprise clients value in an IT industry that has been rapidly reordering; technologies such as AI, blockchain and cybersecurity; delivered in hybrid cloud environments. In the first nine months of 2018, the company delivered revenue growth, as reported and adjusted for currency, an improving gross margin trajectory which was flat in the third quarter compared to the prior year (GAAP and 
operating (non-GAAP)) and returned significant value to shareholders. This is consistent with the long-term model and reinforces the companys position as high-value. 
At mid-October spot rates, the company expects a 0 to 1 point currency benefit to full-year 2018 revenue growth, including a 2 point currency headwind in the fourth quarter and continues to expect full-year revenue growth. The company expects average seasonality (of the last three to five years) for revenue performance from the third to fourth quarter. With enterprise productivity, the company expects both GAAP and operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin expansion in the fourth quarter. 
The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018. Free cash flow expectations for the year include a year-to-year headwind from strong receivables performance in 2017, a year-to-year headwind from cash tax payments, which was fully realized by the end of the second quarter, and a full year expected increase in capital expenditures. Free cash flow realization, which is defined as free cash flow to income from continuing operations (GAAP), is expected to be over 100% for the year, driven by sales cycle working capital, pension and capital expenditures (net of depreciation and amortization), mitigated by income taxes. 
The company expects 2018 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $3.1 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million compared to 2017. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2017. Consistent with the new FASB guidance for the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2017. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million compared to 2017, driven by lower income from expected return on assets and a year-to-year impact due to the pension obligation adjustment resulting from the successful resolution of the UK pension litigation matter in 2017. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2018, a decrease of approximately $100 million compared to 2017. 
In recent months there have been reported economic events impacting the Argentinean economy, such as significant depreciation of the Argentine peso, increases in interest rates and the Argentine government requesting financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The three-year cumulative inflation rates, using a combination of monthly indices, exceeded the 100% threshold for hyperinflation. As a result, effective July 1, 2018, the company changed the functional currency from local currency to U.S. dollar functional for Argentina with no material impact. The ongoing impact from the change is not expected to be material given the size of the companys operations in the country (less than 1 percent of total 2017 revenue). 
In the companys 2017 Annual Report, on pages 67 to 70, there is a discussion of the companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of data. The table presented on page 67 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of the companys global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the nine months ended, or as of, as applicable, September 30, 2018, those amounts are $11.1 billion of net cash from operating activities, $14.7 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $15.3 billion in global credit facilities, respectively. 
The major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at September 30, 2018 appear in the following table. The ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2017. The company does not have ratings trigger provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The companys contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At September 30, 2018, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $415 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the companys outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity. 
Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows. As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric. 
In the first nine months of 2018, the company generated free cash flow of $5.4 billion, a decrease of $0.8 billion versus the prior year driven by higher capital expenditures and higher cash taxes. Net capital expenditures of $2.8 billion increased $0.5 billion year to year reflecting increased investments to build out global cloud datacenters. In the first nine months of 2018, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $4.2 billion in dividends and $2.4 billion in gross common stock repurchases (16.0 million shares). 
funding, the company expects to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately $400 million in 2018. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2018. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. The company is not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations. 
In 2018, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit plans. 
The companys U.S. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund its current domestic operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. The companys U.S. operations generate substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany loans with certain foreign subsidiaries.
