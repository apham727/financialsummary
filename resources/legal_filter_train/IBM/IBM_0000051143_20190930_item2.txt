used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. Refer to “Currency Rate Fluctuations” for additional information.
 Total cloud revenue of $5.0 billion in the third quarter of 2019 grew 11 percent as reported and 12 percent adjusted for currency. Over the trailing 12 months, total cloud revenue was $20.0 billion, up 5 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) year to year.
 Total expense and other (income) increased 17.3 percent in the third quarter of 2019 versus the prior year primarily driven by higher spending including Red Hat, investments in software and systems innovation, and lower intellectual income (IP) income, partially offset by lower non-operating retirement-related costs and divested businesses. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 15.9 percent year to year, driven primarily by the higher spending described above. 
 Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion decreased 49.2 percent and the pre-tax margin was 8.4 percent, a decrease of 7.5 points versus the prior-year period. This decline was primarily driven by the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment (lower revenue without an equivalent adjustment to cost and expense) and the acquisition-related activity. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was (9.9) percent, a decrease of 20.1 points compared to the third quarter of 2018. The year-to-year decrease was primarily driven by a benefit from the realization of a tax only capital loss in a subsidiary (10.7 points), an increase in tax benefits attributable to audit activity (4.3 points), as well as a benefit due to the mix of geographic income year to year (5.0 points), primarily driven by Red Hat. Net income of $1.7 billion decreased 37.9 percent and the net income margin was 9.3 percent, a decrease of 5.1 points year to year.
 Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion decreased 33.4 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 5.9 points to 13.3 percent. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 0.1 percent, a decrease of 12.7 points compared to the third quarter of 2018. The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factors mentioned above. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion decreased 23.6 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 13.3 percent, down 3.4 points year to year.
 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.87 in the third quarter of 2019 decreased 36.4 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $2.68 decreased 21.6 percent versus the third quarter of 2018. In the third quarter of 2019, the company repurchased 0.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $0.1 billion and had $2.0 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization at September 30, 2019. The company suspended its share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat closing.
 2019 results were impacted by Red Hat purchase accounting and acquisition-related activity.
 2019 results were impacted by Red Hat purchase accounting and acquisition-related activity. 
 In the first nine months of 2019, the company reported $55.4 billion in revenue, $5.8 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $7.2 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.46 as reported and $8.10 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company also generated $11.3 billion in cash from operations, $5.9 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $5.6 billion in dividends and gross common stock repurchases.
 Total expense and other (income) decreased 0.7 percent in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year performance was driven by lower non-operating retirement-related costs (4 points), the impact of currency (4 points) and gains from divestitures (3 points), partially offset by higher spending including Red Hat (6 points), amortization of acquired intangible assets and other non-operating activity related to the Red Hat acquisition (3 points) and a decrease in IP income (2 points). Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 0.7 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors excluding the non-operating retirement-related costs and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and other non-operating activity related to the Red Hat acquisition.
 Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $6.2 billion decreased 10.6 percent and the pre-tax margin was 11.1 percent, a decrease of 0.8 points versus 2018. Similar to the three months ended September 30, 2019, the nine month period was also impacted by the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment and Red Hat acquisition-related activity. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was 6.6 percent, an increase of 4.6 points compared to the first nine months of 2018. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by a reduced benefit related to audit activity compared to the prior year. Net income of $5.8 billion decreased 15.0 percent and the net income margin was 10.4 percent, down 1.3 points year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $7.8 billion decreased 10.4 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 1.0 point to 14.1 percent. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was 7.4 percent, an increase of 2.0 points compared to the first nine months of 2018. The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factors mentioned above. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $7.2 billion decreased 12.3 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 13.1 percent, down 1.2 points year to year.
 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.46 in the first nine months of 2019 decreased 12.2 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $8.10 decreased 9.6 percent versus the first nine months of 2018. In the first nine months of 2019, the company repurchased 10.0 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.3 billion. 
 At September 30, 2019, the balance sheet remained strong with the flexibility to support the business. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $11.0 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion from December 31, 
2018. Although debt balances have increased since year-end 2018 driven by new issuances to finance the acquisition of Red Hat, the company reduced debt by $6.7 billion since June 30, 2019. 
●Increases in goodwill of $21.7 billion and intangible assets of $12.5 billion primarily associated with the acquisition of Red Hat; and
●An increase in operating right-of-use assets of $4.9 billion resulting from the adoption of the new leasing standard on January 1, 2019; partially offset by
●A decrease in financing receivables of $11.5 billion primarily due to the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations.
●An increase in operating lease liabilities of $5.2 billion resulting from the adoption of the new leasing standard.
●Increases from net income of $5.8 billion and retirement related plans of $1.1 billion; partially offset by

The following is an analysis of the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 reportable segment external revenue and gross margin results. Segment pre-tax income includes 
2019 results were impacted by Red Hat purchase accounting and acquisition-related activity.
Cognitive Applications includes software that addresses vertical and domain-specific solutions, increasingly infused with AI. This includes areas such as health, financial services, Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, The Weather Company and security software and services. In the third quarter, Cognitive Applications revenue of $1,383 million grew 4.5 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven by double-digit growth in Security software and services, and in industry verticals such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The Security performance included continued strong results in threat management software and services offerings. Within IoT, there was good performance across the portfolio as the business continued to invest in new offerings and industry-specifc solutions.
Transaction Processing Platforms includes software that supports client mission critical on-premise workloads, including transaction processing software as well as analytics and integration software running on IBM operating systems. In the third quarter, Transaction Processing Platforms revenue of $1,589 million decreased 4.8 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. Although much of this business is annuity-based, the year-to-year decline in the third quarter revenue reflects the timing of larger transactions that are tied to client buying cycles.
Global Business Services revenue of $4,117 million increased 1.0 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by strong performance in Consulting. For the first nine months of the year, Global Business Services revenue of $12,391 million increased 0.5 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency. This growth demonstrates GBS’ ability to bring together deep industry 
expertise and technology to provide clients a holistic approach to de-risk and orchestrate their digital transformation journey.
Application Management revenue of $1,897 million declined 1.0 percent as reported, but was flat adjusted for currency compared to the third-quarter 2018, driven primarily by growth in application modernization offerings. Cloud application offerings help clients to implement cloud-centric architectures to modernize and automate their application portfolio. As the company has been standardizing on Red Hat OpenShift as the preferred development platform, there was early progress in synergies in the quarter.
Global Process Services third-quarter revenue of $247 million decreased 5.1 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency.
GBS third-quarter gross profit margin of 31.1 percent grew 1.1 points on a year-to-year basis, driven by the continued mix shift to higher-value offerings, the yield from delivery improvement, productivity, and utilization initiatives and a currency benefit from leveraging the global delivery resource model. Pre-tax income increased to $573 million and pre-tax margin of 13.7 percent was flat year to year in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year. For the first nine months of the year, pre-tax income of $1,188 million increased 11.7 percent and the pre-tax margin increased 1.0 points to 9.4 percent. The pre-tax margin for the first nine months of 2019 included a lower level of workforce rebalancing charges year to year.
 Global Technology Services revenue of $6,700 million declined 5.6 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year. There was continued growth in services that help clients move and manage workloads. However, performance in the segment reflects lower in-period revenue from client business volumes in certain markets and some multi-national clients. Although these lower volumes impact near-term revenue and profit, the business had good long-term signings and a solid pipeline of future deals that will deliver productivity to clients. For the first nine months of the year, Global Technology Services revenue of $20,412 million declined 6.6 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency).
The estimated total services backlog at September 30, 2019 was $107.6 billion, a decrease of 4.7 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency). 
Systems revenue of $1,481 million decreased 14.7 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year. Systems Hardware revenue of $1,117 million decreased 16.6 percent as reported (16 percent adjusted for currency). The decline was across the product portfolio, but primarily reflects the back end of the z14 mainframe product cycle. The business continues to invest to bring new innovation across the platforms, and introduced the next generation of IBM Z and high-end storage in mid-September. Operating Systems Software revenue of $364 million decreased 8.1 percent as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. For the first nine months of 2019, Systems revenue of $4,562 million decreased 15.7 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the first nine months of 2018, driven primarily by IBM Z and Storage Systems. Operating Systems Software revenue decreased 1.7 percent as reported, but increased 1 percent adjusted for currency.
IBM Z revenue declined 20.6 percent as reported (20 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, reflecting the end of the z14 product cycle in the current period compared to solid growth in the third-quarter 2018. The new z15 mainframe began to ship in the last week of the quarter with a good start to the cycle. The z15 mainframe’s capabilities extend the platform’s differentiation with encryption everywhere, cloud native (with the introduction of Red Hat OpenShift) and instant recovery. The z15 will offer clients improved productivity, security and efficiency.
Storage Systems revenue decreased 5.5 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting improvement in year-to-year performance compared to recent quarters, driven by the high-end products and growth in All Flash Array. In mid-September 2019, the company introduced the next generation, high-end storage system DS8900 which delivers comprehensive next-level cyber security, data availability and system resiliency, specifically designed for mission-critical hybrid multicloud environments.
In the third quarter of 2019, pre-tax income of $39 million declined 81.3 percent and pre-tax margin decreased 8.6 points year to year to 2.3 percent. The pre-tax margin was impacted by portfolio mix, the z14 product cycle and investments made to bring new hardware innovation to market. For the first nine months of 2019, Systems had a pre-tax loss of $101 million compared to pre-tax income of $352 million in the first nine months of the prior year. Pre-tax margin decreased 7.9 points year to year to (2.0) percent, primarily due to the same factors as the third quarter.
Global Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity. Global Financing facilitates IBM clients’ acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a lease, 
Total sales of used equipment represented 46.1 percent of Global Financing’s revenue in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 42.7 percent in the third quarter of 2018. The increase was due to declines in internal and external financing revenue. Total sales of used equipment represented 40.8 percent of Global Financing’s revenue in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 49.2 percent in the first nine months of 2018. The decrease was due to lower volumes of both internal and external used equipment sales. The gross profit margin on used sales was 56.6 percent and 50.9 percent in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 54.4 percent and 56.6 percent in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Global Financing pre-tax income decreased 10.8 percent to $275 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower gross profit of $45 million, partially offset by a decrease in expense of $12 
Global Financing return on equity was 32.4 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to 27.5 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase was due to a lower average equity balance. Return on equity was 23.0 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to 30.5 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease was driven by a decline in net income, which included higher tax expense in the first quarter of 2019 due to additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury regarding the U.S. tax reform repatriation tax. Refer to page 101 for the details of the after-tax income and return on equity calculation.

Americas revenue of $25,813 million decreased 3.6 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency. EMEA revenue of $17,354 million decreased 5.7 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency. Asia Pacific revenue of $12,203 million decreased 3.5 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency.
 Total expense and other (income) increased 17.3 percent in the third quarter of 2019 versus the prior year primarily driven by higher spending including Red Hat, investments in software and systems innovation, and lower IP income, partially offset by lower non-operating retirement-related costs and divested businesses. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 15.9 percent year to year, driven primarily by the higher spending described above. 
●The effects of currency (2 points).
Operating (non-GAAP) expense increased 7.6 percent year to year primarily driven by the same factors excluding the acquisition-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the Red Hat transaction.
●The effects of currency (2 points).
Operating (non-GAAP) expense increased 0.8 percent year to year, primarily driven by the same factors excluding the acquisition-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the Red Hat transaction. 
Bad debt expense decreased $6 million year to year in the first nine months of 2019. The receivables provision coverage was 1.9 percent at September 30, 2019, an increase of 30 basis points from December 31, 2018 and unchanged from September 30, 2018.

●Lower non-operating retirement-related costs ($244 million). Refer to “Retirement-Related Plans” for additional information; and
●Higher gains reflected in other from divestitures ($72 million). 
Operating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense was $166 million of income in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $51 million compared to the prior-year period. The year-to-year change was driven primarily by the higher gains from divestitures described above. 
●Lower non-operating retirement-related costs ($766 million). Refer to “Retirement-Related Plans” for additional information; 
●Net exchange gains (including derivative instruments) in the current year versus net exchange losses (including derivative instruments) in the prior year ($340 million). The company’s hedging programs help mitigate currency impacts in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
 Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost decreased by $242 million compared to the third quarter of 2018, driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($276 million), primarily due to the change in the amortization period in the U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan and higher expected return on plan assets ($35 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($44 million). Total cost for the first nine months of 2019 decreased $803 million versus the first nine months of 2018, driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($846 million) primarily due to the amortization period change and higher expected return on plan assets ($92 million); partially offset by higher interest costs ($120 million). 
third quarter of 2019 were $367 million, an increase of $2 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. Non-operating costs of $145 million in the third quarter of 2019 decreased $244 million year to year, driven primarily by lower recognized actuarial losses ($276 million) and a higher expected return on plan assets ($35 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($44 million). For the first nine months of 2019, operating retirement-related costs were $1,078 million, a decrease of $38 million and non-operating costs were $419 million, a decrease of $766 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the same factors as above. 
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was (9.9) percent, a decrease of 20.1 points compared to the third quarter of 2018. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was 6.6 percent, an increase of 4.6 points compared to the first nine months of 2018. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 0.1 percent, a decrease of 12.7 points compared to the third quarter of 2018. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was 7.4 percent, an increase of 2.0 points compared to the first nine months of 2018.
The decrease in the continuing operations effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by a benefit from the realization of a tax only capital loss in a subsidiary (10.7 points), an increase in tax benefits attributable to audit activity (4.3 points), as well as a benefit due to the mix of geographic income year to year (5.0 points), primarily driven by Red Hat. The change in the continuing operations tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by reduced benefit related to audit activity (4.6 points). The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factors.
Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.
Actual shares outstanding at September 30, 2019 were 885.6 million. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were 22.4 million (2.4 percent) and 27.5 million (3.0 percent) shares lower than the same periods of 2018. The decreases were primarily the result of the common stock repurchase program. 
At September 30, 2019, the balance sheet remained strong with flexibility to support the business. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $10,957 million. The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives. Total debt of $66,327 million at September 30, 2019 increased $20,515 million from December 31, 2018, driven by new debt issuances of $26,263 million to primarily fund the Red Hat acquisition; partially offset by debt maturities of $5,376 million. Within total debt, $23,078 million is in support of the Global Financing business. In the first nine months of 2019, the company generated $11,319 million in net cash from operations, compared to $11,128 million in the first nine months of 2018. The company has consistently generated strong cash flows from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its credit facilities. The strong free cash flow generated by the company, portfolio actions taken and the suspension of share repurchases position IBM to return to its target leverage ratios within a couple of years. Through disciplined financial management, the company reduced debt by $6,712 million since June 30, 2019.
The assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of the company’s financial position. At September 30, 2019 those balances reflect the wind down of its OEM IT commercial financing operations. The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are the consolidated amounts including Global Financing.
At September 30, 2019, substantially all client and commercial financing assets were IT related assets, and approximately 60 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers, an increase of 6 points year to year. This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio.
The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigating actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees, non-recourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. Adjusting for the mitigation actions, the investment grade content would increase to 67 percent, a decrease of 3 points year to year.
●A decrease of $1,265 million ($917 million adjusted for currency) in cash, restricted cash, and marketable securities.
●An increase in operating lease liabilities of $1,377 million ($1,399 million adjusted for currency) as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard on January 1, 2019.
The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved increased from 0.9 percent at December 31, 2018, to 1.3 percent at September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the overall decline in gross receivables. Unallocated reserves decreased 30 percent from $72 million at December 31, 2018, to $50 million at September 30, 2019. Specific reserves decreased 6 percent from $220 million at December 31, 2018, to $207 million at September 30, 2019.
Global Financing’s bad debt expense was a release of $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to a release of $6 million for the same period in 2018.
Global Financing’s bad debt expense was a release of $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to an addition of $18 million for the same period in 2018, due to lower specific reserves and a higher unallocated reserve release in 2019.
●A decrease in long-term financing receivables of $1,408 million ($1,337 million adjusted for currency) as a result of reductions from seasonally higher year-end balances.
●Reclassifications to short-term debt of $3,319 million to reflect upcoming maturities.
●A decrease in retirement and postretirement plans of $1,076 million ($667 million adjusted for currency).
Global Financing debt of $23,078 million decreased $8,148 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations.
 Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the company’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global Technology Services, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset portfolio. Based on their attributes, these Global Technology Services assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base.
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arm’s-length pricing. The Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9.0 to 1 at September 30, 2019.
As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing Results of Operations” and in note 8, “Segments.” In the company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
Total equity increased $1,166 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases from net income ($5,761 million) and retirement-related plans ($1,095 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends paid ($4,269 million) and an increase in treasury stock ($1,404 million) primarily due to share repurchases.
●Performance-related declines within net income and Red Hat acquisition-related impacts.
●An increase in cash provided by divestitures of $927 million.
The company is focused on chapter 2 of cloud, which will shift mission-critical work to the cloud and optimize everything from supply chains to core banking systems. To address this opportunity, enterprises need to be able to move and manage data, services, and workflows across multiple clouds and on-premises. They also need to be able to address security concerns, data protection and protocols, availability, and cloud management. This requires a hybrid, multi-cloud, open approach. On July 9, 2019, IBM closed the acquisition of Red Hat, which will significantly change the cloud 
landscape and accelerate the company’s high value business model. Together, IBM and Red Hat will drive innovation and shift clients’ mission-critical workloads to the cloud by offering a next-generation hybrid, multi-cloud platform built on open source technologies. The acquisition of Red Hat positions IBM to be the leading hybrid cloud provider. 
Red Hat is expected to be free cash flow accretive to IBM in the first twelve months, with nominal dilution in second-half 2019. The company also remains on track to achieve free cash flow of approximately $12 billion in 2019. Combined with the additional software and services profits, and net of incremental interest to finance the transaction and other acquisition-related charges, Red Hat is expected to add $0.5 billion and $1 billion to IBM’s free cash flow in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The Red Hat acquisition was funded through a combination of cash and debt, with the incremental debt issued in the first half of 2019. The company will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings. The company is targeting a leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple years, while maintaining its solid and growing dividend. IBM suspended its share repurchase 
program at the close of the acquisition to direct its free cash flow towards reducing debt levels. The combination of these actions provides the company with the flexibility to invest in the business going forward.
Beginning in 2019, within the IBM U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan, substantially all the plan participants are now considered inactive, which, as required by U.S. GAAP, resulted in a change in the amortization period of unrecognized actuarial losses, from the average remaining service period of active plan participants to the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants. These periods are approximately 6 years and 18 years, respectively. As a result of this change, there will be a reduction to 2019 amortization expense of approximately $900 million. Actuarial loss amortization is reported within non-operating pension costs. There will be no impact to 2019 operating (non-GAAP) retirement-related costs, funded status, retiree benefit payments or funding requirements of the U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan. However, there will be an impact to free cash flow realization.
The company expects 2019 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.0 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to 2018. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2018. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2018. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $0.6 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower actuarial loss amortization resulting from the change in amortization period for the U.S. plan. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.2 billion in 2019, a decrease of approximately $100 million compared to 2018.
The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to “adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted the company’s year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first nine months of 2019. Based on the currency rate movements in the first nine months of 2019, total revenue decreased 4.3 percent as reported and 1.7 percent at constant currency versus the first nine months of 2018. On an income from continuing operations before income tax basis, these translation impacts mitigated by the net impact of hedging activities 
In the company’s 2018 Annual Report, on pages 60 to 62, there is a discussion of the company’s liquidity including two tables that present three years of data. The table presented on page 60 includes net cash from operating activities, cash, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities, and the size of the company’s global credit facilities for each of the past three years. For the nine months ended, or as of, as applicable, September 30, 2019, those amounts are $11.3 billion of net cash from operating activities, $11.0 billion of cash, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities and $15.3 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
On July 9, 2019, the company closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, the company suspended its share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. Refer to note 13, “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction. In the third-quarter 2019, the company reduced debt by $6.7 billion.
IBM will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings. The company does not have “ratings trigger” provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The company’s contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At September 30, 2019, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $1,074 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no other contractual arrangements 
In July 2017, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. The company is evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate.
Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows. As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.
In 2019, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
The company’s cash flows are sufficient to fund its current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. When additional requirements arise, the company has several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates and utilizing its committed global credit facilities.

The company’s acquisition of Red Hat on July 9, 2019 was funded through a combination of debt and cash, with incremental debt issued earlier this year. The company suspended its share repurchase program at the time of closing. At September 30, 2019 there was approximately $2.0 billion in authorized funds remaining for purchases under this program.
 On September 24, 2019, the company announced that F. William McNabb III had been elected to the IBM Board of Directors, effective October 29, 2019. As a result, Article III, Section 2 of the company’s By-Laws was amended to increase the number of directors to thirteen, effective October 29, 2019. The full text of IBM’s By-Laws, as amended effective October 29, 2019, is included as Exhibit 3.2 to this report.
