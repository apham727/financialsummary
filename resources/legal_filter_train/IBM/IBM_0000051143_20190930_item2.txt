 Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the company’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units.
Based on their attributes, these Global Technology Services assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base.
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt.
The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arm’s-length pricing.
As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing Results of Operations” and in note 8, “Segments.” In the company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
Total equity increased $1,166 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases from net income ($5,761 million) and retirement-related plans ($1,095 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends paid ($4,269 million) and an increase in treasury stock ($1,404 million) primarily due to share repurchases.

landscape and accelerate the company’s high value business model.
The acquisition of Red Hat positions IBM to be the leading hybrid cloud provider.
Consistent with the acquisition of a highly profitable software business, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments will result in the Red Hat acquisition being dilutive to full-year 2019 earnings per share expectations.
This includes the acquired deferred revenue balance.
The level of adjustment reflects the high margin profile of Red Hat’s business, and deferred revenue is expected to be replenished over the subsequent two to three years, given Red Hat’s high renewal rates and a stable and growing client base.
Red Hat is expected to be free cash flow accretive to IBM in the first twelve months, with nominal dilution in second-half 2019.
The company also remains on track to achieve free cash flow of approximately $12 billion in 2019.
The company expects its operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 9 to 10 percent, including an estimate of potential discretes.
Discretes by their nature are difficult to estimate and the actual impacts will be recorded as the discrete events occur.
The Red Hat acquisition was funded through a combination of cash and debt, with the incremental debt issued in the first half of 2019.
The company will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings.
The company is targeting a leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple years, while maintaining its solid and growing dividend.

The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures.
The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software.
A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth.

Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows.
As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow.
