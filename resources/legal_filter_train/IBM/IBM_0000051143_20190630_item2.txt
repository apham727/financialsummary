Item 2.
Effective with the first quarter of 2019, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system.
As a result of these changes, the company revised its reportable segments.
There is no change to the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Refer to note 8, “Segments” for additional information on the changes in reportable segments.
The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis.
The company provided recast historical segment information reflecting these changes in a Form 8-K dated April 4, 2019.
Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period’s currency conversion rate.
Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.
Refer to “Currency Rate Fluctuations” for additional information.
The company’s reportable segment financial results reflect pre-tax operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with the company’s management and measurement system.
 In the second quarter of 2019, the company reported $19.2 billion in revenue, $2.5 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $2.8 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.81 as reported and $3.17 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.

This performance reflects improving fundamentals as the company continues to focus on investment prioritization shifting to higher value areas and the value the company provides to clients in their digital transformations and journey to the cloud.
The company has taken significant actions to improve its position over time including the completion of the two software asset divestitures and workforce actions in the second quarter as well as the acquisition of Red Hat on July 9, 2019.
This acquisition is an important milestone for the company, and one that will significantly impact the cloud landscape.
It is clear that the next chapter of cloud will be about shifting mission-critical work to the cloud and optimizing everything from supply chains to core banking systems.
This requires a hybrid, multicloud, open approach, to provide portability, management consistency and security for enterprise workloads.

At June 30, 2019, the balance sheet remained strong with flexibility to support the business.
Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $46,408 million compared to $12,222 million at December 31, 2018, primarily due to incremental debt issuances to fund the Red Hat acquisition.
On July 9, 2019, approximately $34,000 million of cash was used to close the Red Hat acquisition.
$27,227 million from December 31, 2018, driven by new debt issuances of $31,064 million to primarily be used to fund the Red Hat acquisition; partially offset by debt maturities of $3,778 million.
Within total debt, $24,983 million is in support of the Global Financing business.
The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives.
In the first six months of 2019, the company generated $7,700 million in net cash from operations, compared to $6,896 million in the first six months of 2018.
The company has consistently generated strong cash flows from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its credit facilities.
The strong free cash flow generated by the company, portfolio actions taken and the suspension of share repurchases position IBM to return to its target leverage ratios within a couple of years.
At June 30, 2019, substantially all client and commercial financing assets were IT related assets, and approximately 57 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers, an increase of 3 points year to year.

The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigating actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees, non-recourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease.
Adjusting for the mitigation actions, the investment grade content would increase to 69 percent, a decrease of 1 point year to year.

Global Financing’s bad debt expense was a release of $9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to an addition of $20 million for the same period in 2018, due to lower specific reserves and a higher unallocated reserve release in 2019.
Global Financing’s bad debt expense was a release of $5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared to an addition of $24 million for the same period in 2018, also due to lower specific reserves and a higher unallocated reserve release in 2019.
●A decrease in long-term financing receivables of $707 million ($751 million adjusted for currency) as a result of seasonal reductions from higher year-end balances.
●Reclassifications to short-term debt of $3,149 million to reflect upcoming maturities.
●An increase in long-term operating lease liabilities of $3,946 million ($3,942 million adjusted for currency) as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard on January 1, 2019.
Global Financing debt of $24,983 million decreased $6,244 million from December 31, 2018, partially due to the company’s wind down of its OEM IT commercial financing operations.
 Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the company’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units.
Based on their attributes, these Global Technology Services assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base.
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt.
The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arm’s-length pricing.
The Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9.0 to 1 at June 30, 2019.
As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing Results of Operations” and in note 8, “Segments.” In the company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
Total equity increased $847 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases from net income ($4,089 million) and retirement-related plans ($760 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends paid ($2,833 million) and an increase in treasury stock ($1,315 million) primarily due to share repurchases.
●An increase of $799 million in cash provided by financing receivables.
●A decrease in cash used for net capital expenditures of $852 million.
●An increase in net cash sourced from debt transactions of $27,824 million primarily driven by a higher level of issuances as the company prepared to close the Red Hat acquisition.
The company’s strategies, investments and actions are all made with an objective of optimizing long-term performance.
A long-term perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the major shifts in technology, business and the global economy.
Over the last several years, the company has been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into its offerings while building new solutions and modernizing its existing platforms.
The company’s key differentiators are built around three pillars — innovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model.
The company is focused on the next chapter of cloud, which will shift mission-critical work to the cloud and optimize everything from supply chains to core banking systems.
To address this opportunity, enterprises need to be able to move and manage data, services, and workflows across multiple clouds and on-premises.
This requires a hybrid, multi-cloud, open approach.
On July 9, 2019, the company closed the Red Hat acquisition.
Due to the timing of the closing, the company has not updated full year expectations to include Red Hat or Red Hat related activity.
Through the second quarter, the company remains on track to achieve GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for 2019 of at least $12.45.
Excluding acquisition-related charges of $0.76 per share, non-operating retirement-related items of $0.45 per share and tax reform enactment impacts of $0.24 per share, operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share is on track to be at least $13.90.
Earnings per share expectations do not include Red Hat or Red Hat related activity, other than pre-closing financing costs, which are included in GAAP results.
The company remains on track to achieve free cash flow of approximately $12 billion in 2019.
The free cash flow expectation also does not include estimated impacts from Red Hat.
At closing, Red Hat shareholders were entitled to receive $190 per share in cash, which represented a total equity value of approximately $34 billion and was remitted to the paying agent.
The company funded the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances.
The company previously announced its intent to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021.
Upon closing of the Red Hat acquisition, the company suspended its share repurchase program, which was earlier than previously stated.
With the strong free cash flow generated by the company, portfolio actions taken and the suspension of share repurchases, this positions IBM to return to its target leverage ratios within a couple of years.
The company will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings and supporting a solid and growing dividend.
IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat brings together the best-in-class hybrid cloud providers and will enable companies to securely unlock the full value of cloud for their businesses.
The company has been building hybrid cloud capabilities across the business to address the next chapter of cloud and to prepare for this important milestone.
The acquisition of Red Hat reinforces IBM’s high-value model, combining the power and flexibility of Red Hat’s open hybrid cloud technologies with the scale and depth of IBM’s innovation and industry expertise, which is expected to elevate all of IBM as Red Hat grows and the company sells more software and services.
 As previously stated, the company continues to expect the acquisition of Red Hat, including related activity to be accretive to free cash flow in the first year, and accretive to operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share by the end of the second year after closing.

At June 30, 2019, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars than at year-end 2018.
References to “adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula.
However, this constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates.
Currency movements impacted the company’s year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first six months of 2019.
On an income from continuing operations before income tax basis, these translation impacts mitigated by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately $160 million in the first six months of 2019 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $140 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $175 million in the first six months of 2018 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $200 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.

For the purpose of running its business, the company manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different manner.
The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures.
The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software.
A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth.
Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency.
Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows.
As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow.
In the first six months of 2019, the company generated free cash flow of $4.1 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion versus the prior year.
In the first six months of 2019, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $2.8 billion in dividends and $1.2 billion in gross common stock repurchases (9.2 million shares).

Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2019.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status.
In 2019, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
The company’s cash flows are sufficient to fund its current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service.
