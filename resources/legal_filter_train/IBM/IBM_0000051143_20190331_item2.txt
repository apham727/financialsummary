Item 2.
Effective with the first quarter of 2019, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system.
As a result of these changes, the company revised its reportable segments.
There is no change to the companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
Refer to note 8, Segments on pages 35 to 36 for additional information on the changes in reportable segments.
The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis.
The company provided recast historical segment information reflecting these changes in a Form 8-K dated April 4, 2019.
Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year periods currency conversion rate.
Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.
The following table provides the companys operating (non-GAAP) earnings for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018.
In the first quarter of 2019, the company reported $18.2 billion in revenue, $1.6 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $2.0 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.78 as reported and $2.25 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
The company also generated $4.8 billion in cash from operations, $1.7 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $2.3 billion in gross common stock repurchases and dividends.

The company generated $4.8 billion in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of $0.2 billion compared to the first quarter of 2018, driven primarily by an increase in cash provided by financing receivables ($0.1 billion).
Net cash used in investing activities of $0.9 billion was $0.9 billion lower than the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in cash provided by non-operating finance receivables ($0.3 billion), a decrease in net capital expenditures ($0.3 billion), and lower net purchases of marketable securities and other investments ($0.2 billion).
In the first quarter of 2019, financing activities were a source of cash of $1.9 billion compared to a $2.9 billion use of cash in the first quarter of 2018.
The $4.8 billion increase in cash flow year to year was driven by an increase in net cash sourced from debt transactions ($4.9 billion), with a higher level of issuances and a lower level of maturities in the current year.
The company continues to expect GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of at least $12.45 and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $13.90 per diluted share for 2019.

under contract which is either non-cancellable, or which historically has very low likelihood of termination, given the criticality of certain services to the companys clients.
Services signings are managements initial estimate of the value of a clients commitment under a services contract.
There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings.
The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.
Contract portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for initial signings.
Systems Hardware revenue of $914 million declined 16.4 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency).
These declines were driven by IBM Z and Storage Systems, partially offset by growth in Power Systems.

The Systems gross profit margin increased 2.5 points to 46.2 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year.
The year-to-year increase was driven by actions taken in the prior year to better position the systems cost structure over the longer term, and a current year benefit from mix to operating systems software.
The pre-tax margin decreased 1.3 points year to year, driven by mix due to the z14 product cycle.
Global Financing facilitates IBM clients acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating strong returns on equity.

Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost decreased by $297 million compared to the first quarter of 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($289 million), primarily due to the change in the amortization period in the U.S.
Qualified Personal Pension Plan, higher expected return on plan assets ($26 million) and a decrease in defined contribution plans cost ($20 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($36 million).
As discussed in the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section on page 51, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating.
Non-operating costs of $138 million in the first quarter of 2019 decreased $264 million year to year, driven primarily by lower recognized actuarial losses ($289 million) and a higher expected return on plan assets ($26 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($36 million).
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was 15.4 percent, an increase of 62.9 points compared to the first quarter of 2018.

In the first three months of 2019, the company generated $4,759 million in cash from operations, compared to $4,602 million in the first three months of 2018.
The company has consistently generated strong cash flows from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its credit facilities.
The assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of the companys financial position.
Debt for Global Financing is expected to decline during 2019 as the company winds down its OEM Commercial Financing content.
At March 31, 2019, substantially all client and commercial financing assets were IT related assets, and approximately 55 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers.
This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio.
The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigating actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees, non-recourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease.

Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed.
Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units.
Based on their attributes, these Global Technology Services assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base.
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt.
The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing.
The Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9.0 to 1 at March 31, 2019.
Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units.
As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 59 and in note 8, Segments, on pages 35 and 36.
In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.

These amounts include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business.
· An increase of $98 million in cash provided by financing receivables.
· An increase in net cash sourced from debt transactions of $4,945 million primarily driven by a higher level of issuances and a lower level of maturities in the current year.
The companys strategies, investments and actions are all made with an objective of optimizing long-term performance.
A long-term perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the major shifts in technology, business and the global economy.
Over the long term, in consideration of the opportunities it will continue to develop, the company continues to expect to have the ability to generate low single-digit revenue growth, and with a higher-value business mix, mid single-digit profit growth, high single-digit operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share growth, with free cash flow realization of GAAP net income over 90 percent.
Over the last several years, the company has been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into its offerings while building new solutions and modernizing its existing platforms.
These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend the companys innovation leadership into the future.
The companys key differentiators are built around three pillars  innovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model.
The company is focused on the next chapter of cloud, which will shift mission-critical work to the cloud and optimize everything from supply chains to core banking systems.
To address this opportunity, enterprises need to be able to move and manage data, services, and workflows across multiple clouds and on-premises.
This requires a hybrid, multi-cloud, open approach.
Going forward, the company will continue providing growth rates for cloud and as-a service  the signposts of key emerging high value areas of the IT industry.
The company eliminated its strategic imperatives reporting, established in 2015, with a goal of achieving approximately $40B of revenue across its strategic imperatives, which was achieved in 2018.
IBMs pending acquisition of Red Hat will bring together the best-in-class hybrid cloud providers and will enable companies to securely unlock the full value of cloud for their businesses.
IBM and Red Hat will be strongly positioned to address this opportunity and accelerate hybrid cloud adoption.
The company will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings and supporting a solid and growing dividend.
The company will target a leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating.
During the first quarter of 2019, the company began the issuance of additional debt in preparation of the pending acquisition.
In order to reduce debt, the company intends to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021.
At mid-April 2019 spot rates, the company expects a currency headwind of approximately 2.5 points to second quarter 2019 revenue growth and a headwind of approximately 2.0 points to full year 2019 revenue growth.
The company expects revenue dynamics from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2019 to be similar to the last two years, which is a sequential increase of approximately $900 million to $1 billion.
For full-year 2019, the company expects to expand gross and pre-tax margins.
Excluding acquisition-related charges of $0.76 per share, non-operating retirement-related items of $0.45 per share and tax reform enactment impacts of $0.24 per share, operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share is expected to be at least $13.90.
The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2019.
Free cash flow realization, which is defined as free cash flow to income from continuing operations (GAAP), is expected to be approximately 100 percent for the year.
Discretes by their nature are difficult to estimate and the actual impacts will be recorded as the discrete events occur.
The company expects its operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 11 to 12 percent (which is a 3 to 4 points headwind year to year), including an estimate of potential discretes.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the year, IBMs Global Financing business will wind down the portion of its commercial financing operations, which provides short-term working capital solutions for OEM information technology suppliers, distributors and resellers.
IBM Global Financing will continue to provide differentiated end-to-end financing solutions, including commercial financing in support of IBM partner relationships.
Beginning in 2019, within the IBM U.S.
As a result of this change, there will be a reduction to 2019 amortization expense of approximately $900 million.
Actuarial loss amortization is reported within non-operating pension costs.
Qualified Personal Pension Plan.
However, there will be an impact to free cash flow realization.
The company expects 2019 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.0 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to 2018.
This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2018.
Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $0.6 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower actuarial loss amortization resulting from the change in amortization period for the U.S. plan.
Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2019, an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2018.
At March 31, 2019, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2018.
The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions.
References to adjusted for currency or constant currency reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula.
However, this constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates.
Based on the currency rate movements in the first three months of 2019, total revenue decreased 4.7 percent as reported and 0.9 percent at constant currency versus the first three months of 2018.
The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $70 million in the first three months of 2018 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $90 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars.
In the companys 2018 Annual Report, on pages 60 to 62, there is a discussion of the companys liquidity including two tables that present three years of data.
For the three months ended, or as of, as applicable, March 31, 2019, those amounts are $4.8 billion of net cash from operating activities, $18.1 billion of cash, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities and $15.3 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
On October 28, 2018, IBM announced its intent to acquire all the outstanding shares of Red Hat.
The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearance.
The company intends to fund this transaction through a combination of cash and debt.
In connection with this acquisition, IBM entered into a commitment letter under which certain banks committed to provide the company with a 364-day unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $20 billion to fund the acquisition.
The major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at March 31, 2019 appear in the following table and remain unchanged from December 31, 2018.
IBM will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings.
The company does not have ratings trigger provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating.
The companys contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade.
At March 31, 2019, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $705 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the companys outstanding instruments and market conditions.
For the purpose of running its business, the company manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different manner.
The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures.
The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software.
A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth.
Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency.
Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.
Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows.
As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow.
In the first quarter, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $1.4 billion in dividends and $0.9 billion in gross common stock repurchases (6.9 million shares).
With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately $400 million in 2019.
Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2019.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status.
In 2019, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
The companys cash flows are sufficient to fund its current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service.
When additional requirements arise, the company has several liquidity options available.
Refer to the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section on page 51 for the companys rationale for presenting operating earnings information.
The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
The companys management evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Item 2.
