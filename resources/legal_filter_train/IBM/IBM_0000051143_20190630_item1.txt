The financial statements and footnotes are unaudited.
Refer to note 8, “Segments,” for additional information on the changes in reportable segments.
The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis.
The company provided recast historical segment information reflecting these changes in a Form 8-K dated April 4, 2019.
Noncontrolling interest amounts of $4.9 million and $3.8 million, net of tax, for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $11.9 million and $11.7 million, net of tax, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are included as a reduction within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the company’s 2018 Annual Report.
Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
This is annotated where applicable.
In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the goodwill impairment test by removing Step 2.
The guidance also changes the requirements for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires additional disclosures for these reporting units.
The company expects to adopt the guidance on a prospective basis on the effective date.
The company is evaluating the impact of the guidance.
In June 2016, with amendments in 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued guidance for credit impairment based on an expected loss model rather than an incurred loss model.
The new guidance expands the scope of financial instruments subject to impairment, including off-balance sheet commitments and residual value.
The company will adopt the guidance as of the effective date.
A cross-functional team was established to evaluate the impact of the guidance on the financial instruments portfolio.
All of the changes to systems, processes and policies are on track for completion before the effective date.
The FASB issued guidance in February 2016, with amendments in 2018 and 2019, which changed the accounting for leases.
The guidance requires lessees to recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for most leases in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The guidance also made some changes to lessor accounting, including elimination of the use of third-party residual value guarantee insurance in the lease classification test, and overall aligns with the new revenue recognition guidance.
The company elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components for all asset classes.
The company made a policy election to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes.
As a lessee, at adoption, the company recognized operating and financing ROU assets of $4.8 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, and operating and financing lease liabilities of $5.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively.
Refer to note 5, “Leases,” for additional information, including further discussion on the impact of adoption.
In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on a customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in cloud-computing arrangements that are hosted by a vendor.
Certain types of implementation costs should be capitalized and amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement.
The company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis.
In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which addresses aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.
The guidance required certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.
The amendment also simplified the impairment test of equity investments that lack readily determinable fair value.
The FASB issued guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014 with amendments in 2015 and 2016.
Revenue recognition depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The guidance also requires specific disclosures relating to revenue recognition.
At adoption, $557 million was reclassified from notes and accounts receivable-trade and deferred income-current to prepaid expenses and other current assets to establish the opening balance for net contract assets.
In-scope sales commission costs previously recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings were capitalized in deferred costs in accordance with the transition guidance, in the amount of $737 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recognized an additional impact to net deferred taxes and retained earnings of $56 million, resulting in a total net increase to retained earnings of $580 million.
Refer to note 3, “Revenue Recognition,” for additional information.
These impacts are recorded on a prospective basis.
The company continues to estimate forfeitures in conjunction with measuring stock-based compensation cost.
The FASB also issued guidance in May 2017 and June 2018, which relates to the accounting for modifications of share-based payment awards and accounting for share-based payments issued to non-employees, respectively.
The company adopted the guidance for modifications in the second quarter of 2017, and guidance for non-employees’ payments in the second quarter of 2018.
The remaining performance obligation (RPO) disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the company expects to recognize these amounts in revenue.
It is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract that has not yet been performed and does not include contracts in which the customer is not committed, such as certain as-a-Service, governmental, term software license and services offerings.
The customer is not considered committed when they are able to terminate for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty.
Additionally, as a practical expedient, the company does not include contracts that have an original duration of one year or less.
For the three and six months ending June 30, 2019, revenue was reduced by $22 million and $35 million, respectively, for performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods mainly due to changes in estimates on percentage-of-completion based contracts.
For the three and six months ending June 30, 2018, the impact to revenue for performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods was immaterial.
The amount of revenue recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 that was included within the deferred income balance at March 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018 was $4.0 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively, and primarily related to services and software.
●Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The guidance requires the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort.
When available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the fair value and classifies such items as Level 1.
Items valued using internally generated models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.
The determination of fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments.
For derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
●Counterparty credit risk adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
●Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value.
The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the company’s own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
These inputs relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are available for the full term of the derivative.
Certain assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis can be subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.
These assets include available-for-sale debt securities that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
In the event of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security, fair value is measured using a model described above.
Certain non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment, operating right-of-use assets, land, goodwill and intangible assets are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired.
The impairment models used for non-financial assets depend on the type of asset.
There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Accounting guidance permits the measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards.
The company has not applied the fair value option to any eligible assets or liabilities.
Notes and other accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value.
Fair values are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term receivables was immaterial.
If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value of publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market.
For other long-term debt (including long-term finance lease liabilities) for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value.
The carrying amount of long-term debt was $58,445 million and $35,605 million, and the estimated fair value was $62,018 million and $36,599 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The contractual maturities of substantially all available-for-sale debt securities are less than one year at June 30, 2019.
For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements between the interest rates associated with the company’s lease and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt.
Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt.
As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations.
The right of set-off that exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default.
The company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its major derivative counterparties.
These arrangements require the company to hold or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds.
Posting thresholds can be fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings received from the major credit agencies.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements that were in a liability position at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $325 million and $74 million, respectively, for which $8 million of collateral was posted by the company and reduced the position at June 30, 2019 and no collateral was posted at December 31, 2018.
Full collateralization of these agreements would be required in the event that the company’s credit rating falls below investment grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security arrangements.
The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $419 million and $731 million, respectively.
This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting date if the counterparties failed to perform as contracted.
This exposure was reduced by $262 million and $267 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those counterparties.
In the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments.
The amount recognized in other receivables for the right to reclaim cash collateral was $8 million at June 30, 2019.
No amount was recognized in other receivables at December 31, 2018 for the right to reclaim cash collateral.
The amount recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral was $70 million at December 31, 2018.
No amount was recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral at June 30, 2019.
The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in restricted cash in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
No amount was rehypothecated at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company may utilize derivatives to offset the changes in the fair value of the de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity.
In its hedging programs, the company may use forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, equity swaps, and options depending upon the underlying exposure.
The company is not a party to leveraged derivative instruments.
A brief description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.
The company issues debt in the global capital markets to fund its operations and financing business.
Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets.
To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company may use interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges).
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of the company’s interest-rate swaps was $5.5 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively.
The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was approximately 2.5 years and 3.5 years, respectively.
The company did not have any cash flow hedges relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
To manage this risk, the company may use instruments such as forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuances.
On May 15, 2019, the company issued an aggregate of $20 billion of indebtedness (see note 13, “Borrowings,” for additional information).
Following the receipt of the net proceeds from this debt offering, the company terminated $5.5 billion of forward starting interest-rate swaps.
In connection with cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments related to the company's borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $201 million and net losses of $35 million (before taxes) at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, in AOCI.
The company estimates that $18 million (before taxes) of the deferred net losses on derivatives in AOCI at June 30, 2019 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.
The company also uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk management purpose.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $6.5 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.2 years at both periods.
In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency risk.
The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is four years.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.8 years at both periods.
The company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt.
These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately 12 years.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was $12.2 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $84 million and net gains of $75 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI.
The company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries.
The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally less than one year.
The company may hold warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with various investments that are deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net cash settlement provisions.
The company is exposed to a potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms.
The company may utilize credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit exposures.
The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
In its ordinary course of business, the company enters into leases as a lessee for property, plant and equipment.
The company is also the lessor of certain equipment, mainly through its Global Financing segment.
When procuring goods or services, or upon entering into a contract with its clients, the company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at its inception.
If there is either an explicit or embedded lease within a contract, the company determines the classification of the lease (e.g., finance, operating, sales-type lease) at the lease commencement date.
Effective January 1, 2019, when the company is the lessee, all leases with a term of more than 12 months are recognized as ROU assets and associated lease liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where the company is the lessee.
The ROU asset equals the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs (IDCs), prepaid rent and lease incentives.
The company’s variable lease payments generally relate to payments tied to various indexes, non-lease components and payments above a contractual minimum fixed payment.
ROU assets represent the company’s right to control the underlying assets under lease, and the lease liability is the obligation to make the lease payments related to the underlying assets under lease.
Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, short-term debt and long-term debt in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
At June 30, 2019, the total amount of ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in property, plant and equipment, short-term debt and long-term debt was $63 million, $7 million and $65 million, respectively.
For operating leases, the amortization of the ROU asset and the interest expense on the lease liability are not separately recorded; rather, the lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a single-line item in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, unless the ROU asset is impaired.
The company has elected to not recognize leases with a lease term of less than 12 months in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, including those acquired in a business combination, and lease costs for those short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The company recorded net gains on sale and leaseback transactions of $5 million and $41 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
Prior to the adoption of the new lease guidance on January 1, 2019, ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases were not recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The company has elected the practical expedient to not provide comparable presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for periods prior to adoption.
Rental expense, including amounts charged to inventories and fixed assets, and excluding amounts previously reserved, was $1,944 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The difference between the company’s total lease commitments as reported at December 31, 2018 compared to the January 1, 2019 ROU asset balance in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is primarily due to the required use of a discount factor (imputed interest) under the new lease guidance and certain amounts that are not included in the ROU asset under the new lease guidance (e.g., tenant incentives and vacant space).
Assets under lease include new and used IBM equipment and certain OEM products.
IBM equipment generally consists of IBM Z, Power Systems and Storage Systems products.
The majority of the company’s leases do not contain variable payments that are dependent on an index or a rate.
The company has made a policy election to exclude from consideration in contracts all collections from sales and other similar taxes.
The company’s payment terms for leases are typically unconditional.
Therefore, in an instance when the client requests to terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term, the client would typically be required to pay the remaining lease payments in full.
At the end of the lease term, the company allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment at the then-current fair market value or at a pre-stated purchase price or renew the lease based on mutually agreed upon terms.
When lease arrangements include multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration in the contract between the lease components and the non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis.
If a lease is classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease, the carrying amount of the asset is derecognized from inventory and a net investment in the lease is recorded.
For a sales-type lease, the net investment in the lease is measured at commencement date as the sum of the lease receivable and the estimated residual value of the equipment less unearned income and allowance for credit losses.
At June 30, 2019, the unguaranteed residual value of sales-type and direct financing leases was $582 million.
For further information on the company’s net investment in leases, including residual values, refer to note 6, “Financing Receivables.” Any selling profit or loss arising from a sales-type lease is recorded at lease commencement.
Under a sales-type lease, initial direct costs are expensed at lease commencement.
Over the term of the lease, the company recognizes finance income on the net investment in the lease and any variable lease payments, which are not included in the net investment in the lease.
For a direct financing lease, the investment in the lease is measured similarly to a sales-type lease, however, the net investment in the lease is reduced by any selling profit.
In a direct financing lease, the selling profit and initial direct costs are deferred at commencement and recognized over the lease term.
The company rarely enters into direct financing leases.
The company optimizes the recovery of residual values by extending lease arrangements with, or selling leased equipment to existing clients.
The company periodically reassesses the realizable value of its lease residual values.
Anticipated decreases in specific future residual values that are considered to be other-than-temporary are recognized immediately upon identification and are recorded as an adjustment to the residual value estimate.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively, impairment of residual values was immaterial.
Equipment provided to clients under an operating lease is carried at cost within property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and depreciated over the lease term using the straight-line method, generally ranging from one to six years.
The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term.
At June 30, 2019, the unguaranteed residual value of operating leases was $97 million.
At commencement of an operating lease, IDCs are deferred.
As lease payments are made, the company records sales revenue over the lease term.
IDCs are amortized over the lease term on the same basis as lease income is recorded.
The impairment test is based on undiscounted cash flows, and, if impaired, the asset is written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values.
There were no material impairment losses incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 for assets under operating leases.
Financing receivables primarily consist of client loan and installment payment receivables (loans), investment in sales-type and direct financing leases and commercial financing receivables.
Client loan and installment payment receivables (loans) are provided primarily to clients to finance the purchase of hardware, software and services.
Client loans and installment payment financing contracts are priced independently at competitive market rates.
Investment in sales-type and direct financing leases relates principally to the company’s Systems products and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years.
Commercial financing receivables relate primarily to inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and OEM products.
Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days.
This wind down is consistent with IBM’s capital allocation strategy and high-value focus.
IBM Global Financing will continue to provide differentiated end-to-end financing solutions, including commercial financing in support of IBM partner relationships.
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for nonrecourse borrowings.
Financing receivables pledged as collateral for borrowings were $938 million and $710 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
Provisions for credit losses recorded for lease receivables were a release of $6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, with the remainder of the current period benefit released for loan receivables.
The average recorded investment of impaired leases and loans for Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific were $146 million, $48 million and $50 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and $128 million, $55 million and $78 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The average recorded investment of impaired leases and loans for Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific were $146 million, $50 million and $50 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and $128 million, $56 million and $80 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
income recognized on a cash basis on impaired leases and loans were immaterial for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Write-offs of lease receivables and loan receivables were $15 million and $20 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.
When determining the allowances, financing receivables are evaluated either on an individual or a collective basis.
For those accounts in which the loss is probable, the company records a specific reserve.
The company considers any receivable with an individually evaluated reserve as an impaired receivable.
The company considers a client’s financing receivable balance past due when any installment is aged over 90 days.
including recorded investments aged over 90 days and still accruing, billed invoices aged over 90 days and still accruing, and recorded investment not accruing.
The company’s credit quality indicators, which are based on rating agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers, are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk.
The resulting indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Moody’s Investors Service credit ratings as shown below.
The company uses information provided by Moody’s, where available, as one of many inputs in its determination of customer credit ratings.
The following tables present the recorded investment net of allowance for credit losses for each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
from Aaa to Baa3 are considered investment grade.
All others are considered non-investment grade.
The credit quality indicators do not reflect mitigation actions that the company takes to transfer credit risk to third parties.
The company did not have any significant troubled debt restructurings during the six months ended June 30, 2019 or for the year ended December 31, 2018 .
The following table presents total stock-based compensation cost included in income from continuing operations.
Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased $10 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.
This was due to an increase related to restricted stock units ($13 million), partially offset by decreases in performance share units ($1 million), stock options ($1 million) and the conversion of stock-based compensation previously issued by acquired entities ($1 million).
Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased $7 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.
This was due to an increase related to restricted stock units ($16 million), partially offset by decreases in performance share units ($5 million), stock options ($2 million) and the conversion of stock-based compensation previously issued by acquired entities ($2 million).
As of June 30, 2019, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $1.0 billion related to non-vested awards was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.8 years.
There was no significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Performance measurement is based on operating pre-tax income from continuing operations.
The Board of Directors authorizes the company to repurchase IBM common stock.
At June 30, 2019, $2,123 million of Board common stock repurchase authorization was available.
The company had previously announced its intent to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021 in order to reduce debt that it had issued to finance the Red Hat acquisition.
The company offers defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans, as well as nonpension postretirement plans primarily consisting of retiree medical benefits.
As of 2019, substantially all the plan participants in the U.S.
Recognized actuarial losses decreased by approximately $240 million and $480 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily driven by the change in amortization period.
There was no impact to funded status, retiree benefit payments or funding requirements of the U.S.
Qualified PPP as a result of this change.
In 2019, the company expects to contribute approximately $400 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans, the largest of which will be contributed to the defined benefit pension plans in Japan, Spain and Belgium.
This amount generally represents the legally mandated minimum contribution.
Total net contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first six months of 2019 were $128 million, of which $63 million was in cash and $65 million in U.S. Treasury securities.
Total contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first six months of 2018 were $237 million, of which $80 million was in cash and $157 million in U.S. Treasury securities.
The contribution of U.S. Treasury securities is considered a non-cash transaction in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The following tables provide the components of the cost for the company’s nonpension postretirement plans.
The company contributed $292 million in U.S. Treasury securities to the U.S. nonpension postretirement benefit and active employee medical trusts during the six months ended June 30, 2019, and $215 million in U.S. Treasury securities during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The contribution of U.S. Treasury securities is considered a non-cash transaction in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Red Hat - On July 9, 2019, the company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Red Hat.
For Red Hat’s open-source software subscriptions, no revenue is recognized upfront from the licensing of the code itself, but rather, is recognized over time throughout the contract term as control of the promised product or service is transferred to the customer.
 On the acquisition date, Red Hat shareholders were entitled to receive $190 per share in cash, which represented a total equity value of approximately $34 billion and was remitted to the paying agent.
The company funded the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances.
Refer to note 13, “Borrowings,” for additional details on the financing of the transaction.
The initial accounting for the Red Hat acquisition is not complete due to the limited amount of time since the acquisition date.
This includes the acquired deferred revenue balance.
The level of adjustment will reflect the high margin profile of Red Hat’s business.
Select IBM Software Products – On December 6, 2018, IBM and HCL Technologies Limited (HCL) announced a definitive agreement, in which HCL would acquire select standalone Cloud and Cognitive Software products for $1,775 million, inclusive of $150 million of contingent consideration.
The transaction included commercial software, intellectual property and services offerings.
The company received cash of $812 million at closing and expects to receive an additional $813 million within 12 months of closing.
