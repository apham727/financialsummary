The total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.8 percent at June 30, 2018, an increase of 20 basis points compared to December 31, 2017.
The majority of the write-offs during the six months ended June 30, 2018 related to Global Financing receivables, which had been previously reserved.
The following table presents external Global Financing receivables excluding residual values, the allowance for credit losses and immaterial miscellaneous receivables.
The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved increased from 1.1 percent at December 31, 2017, to 1.2 percent at June 30, 2018.
The increase was driven by the overall decline in gross receivables.
Specific reserves decreased 1 percent from $258 million at December 31, 2017, to $255 million at June 30, 2018.
Unallocated reserves increased 7 percent from $78 million at December 31, 2017, to $84 million at June 30, 2018.
Global Financings bad debt expense was $20 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $6 million for the same period in 2017 due to higher specific reserve requirements in 2018.
· An increase in retirement plan assets of $732 million ($811 million adjusted for currency) driven by the expected returns on plan assets, partially offset by interest costs.
· A decrease in retirement and nonpension postretirement liabilities of $758 million driven by a currency impact of $308 million.
The companys funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to manage the overall asset and liability profile.
Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed.
Total debt of $45,497 million decreased $1,326 million from December 31, 2017, driven by debt maturities of $3,652 million; partially offset by new debt issuances of $2,535 million.
Non-Global Financing debt of $14,441 million was down $949 million from December 31, 2017 and down $2,186 million from June 30, 2017.
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt.
The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing.
Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units.
As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 70 and in note 7, Segments, on pages 36 and 37.
In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
Total equity increased by $923 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases from net income ($4,083 million), an increase in retirement-related amounts ($1,121 million) and transition adjustments related to the adoption of the new revenue standard ($524 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends ($2,819 million) and an increase in treasury stock ($1,859 million) primarily due to share repurchases.
These amounts include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business.
The companys strategies, investments and actions are all made with an objective of optimizing long-term performance.
A long-term perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the major shifts in technology, business and the global economy.
Over the long term, in consideration of the opportunities it will continue to develop, the company expects to have the ability to generate low single-digit revenue growth, and with a higher-value business mix, mid single-digit profit growth, high single-digit operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share growth, with free cash flow realization of GAAP net income over 90 percent.
Over the last several years, the company has been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into its offerings while building new solutions and modernizing its existing platforms.
The companys key differentiators are built around three pillars - innovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model.
The companys results in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 reflect the work that has been done to reposition the business through investment, shifting skills and reallocating capital.
and earnings per share growth.
A high level of investment is important as the company continues to build its capabilities in AI, cloud, security and blockchain, among others.
While there was some benefit in the second quarter, the majority of the benefit from first-quarter workforce rebalancing actions is expected in the second-half 2018.
Free cash flow realization, which is defined as free cash flow to income from continuing operations (GAAP), is expected to be over 100%.
The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018.
Free cash flow expectations for the year include a year-to-year headwind from strong receivables performance in 2017, a year-to-year headwind from cash tax payments, which has been fully realized by the end of the second quarter, and a full year expected increase in capital expenditures.
The company expects its operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2018 to be 16 percent, plus or minus 2 points (excluding discrete items), which is a headwind year to year.
The company expects 2018 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $3.1 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million compared to 2017.
This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2017.
Consistent with the new FASB guidance for the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2017.
Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million compared to 2017, driven by lower income from expected return on assets and a year-to-year impact due to the pension obligation adjustment resulting from the successful resolution of the UK pension litigation matter in 2017.
Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2018, approximately flat compared to 2017.
At June 30, 2018, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2017.
currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which temporarily mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on the companys financial results.
References to adjusted for currency or constant currency reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula.
However, this constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates.
Currency movements impacted the companys year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first six months of 2018.
Based on the currency rate movements in the first six months of 2018, total revenue increased 4.4 percent as reported and 0.8 percent at constant currency versus the first six months of 2017.
Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars.
In the recent months there have been reported economic events impacting the Argentinean economy, such as significant depreciation of the Argentine peso, increases in interest rates and the Argentine government requesting financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund.
As a result, effective July 1, 2018, the company changed the functional currency from local currency to U.S. dollar functional for Argentina.
In the companys 2017 Annual Report, on pages 67 to 70, there is a discussion of the companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of data.
For the six months ended, or as of, as applicable, June 30, 2018, those amounts are $6.9 billion for net cash from operating activities, $11.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $15.3 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
The major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at June 30, 2018 appear in the table below.
The ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2017.
The companys contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade.
At June 30, 2018, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $256 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the companys outstanding instruments and market conditions.
For the purpose of running its business, the company manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different manner.
The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures.
The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software.
A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth.
Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency.
Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows.
As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow.
In the first six months of 2018, the company generated free cash flow of $3.2 billion, a decrease of $0.4 billion versus the prior year driven by higher cash taxes and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by working capital performance.
Net capital expenditures of $1.9 billion increased $0.3 billion year to year reflecting increased investments to build out global cloud datacenters.
In the first six months of 2018, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $2.8 billion in dividends and $1.8 billion in gross common stock repurchases (11.7 million shares).
With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately $400 million in 2018.
Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2018.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status.
In 2018, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit plans.
The companys U.S. operations generate
substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity options available.
These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany loans with certain foreign subsidiaries.
Refer to the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section on page 56 for the companys rationale for presenting operating earnings information.
The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
The companys management evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
