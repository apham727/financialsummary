The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) have been prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
In management’s opinion, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of interim results.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018.
Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are to our fiscal years ending September 27, 2019 and ended September 28, 2018, respectively.
We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which introduced a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model.
Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products.
Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control.
We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation.
Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of June 28, 2019.
We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product.
We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations.
We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly.
This guidance, as subsequently amended, requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for most leases and is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
We are currently in the process of updating policies, internal controls, financial statement disclosures, and systems to incorporate the impact of the new standard in our financial reporting processes.
We intend to adopt the standard using the optional transition method permitted by ASU No.
2018-11, which allows for application of the standard at the adoption date and no restatement of comparative periods.
We believe that we are following an appropriate timeline to allow for the proper recognition, reporting, and disclosure of leases upon adoption of ASC 842 at the beginning of fiscal 2020.
2017-12, an update to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
The update improves and simplifies hedge accounting and related disclosures.
We elected to early adopt this update, which did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in the quarter ended December 28, 2018.
2016-16, an update to ASC 740, Income Taxes.
This guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs.
The update was adopted on a modified retrospective basis in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 and resulted in a $443 million cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings, which represented the net reversal of all balances associated with deferred tax impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
This included a decrease in other assets of $798 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $418 million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $63 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
This guidance supersedes ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and introduces a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model.
ASC 606 also enhances disclosures related to revenue recognition.
We adopted ASC 606, as amended, in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach.
Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
Because the impact of adoption was immaterial, we have not recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings.
During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments.
In connection with this program, during the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $179 million.
We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during the nine months ended June 28, 2019 by the end of fiscal 2021 and to incur additional charges of approximately $25 million related primarily to employee severance in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments.
During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments.
In connection with this program, during the nine months ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $5 million and $109 million, respectively.
We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2018 by the end of fiscal 2020 and anticipate that any additional charges will be insignificant.
Prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments.
Also prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment.
During the nine months ended June 29, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $9 million related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions.
We expect additional charges related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions to be insignificant.
During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses of $67 million and the guarantee liabilities discussed below.
Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment.
In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale.
These guarantees had a combined value of approximately $1.7 billion as of June 28, 2019 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years.
At the time of sale, we determined that the fair value of these guarantees was $12 million, which we recognized by a charge to pre-tax loss on sale.
Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years.
During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $296 million, net of cash acquired.
The acquisitions were reported as part of our Transportation Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.
During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we recognized goodwill in the Transportation Solutions segment in connection with recent acquisitions.
See Note 4 for additional information regarding acquisitions.
Intangible asset amortization expense was $45 million for the quarters ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018 and $135 million for the nine months ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018.
During the quarter ended June 28, 2019, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued €350 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due June 2021.
In June 2020, we may, at our option, redeem the fixed-to-floating rate senior notes, as a whole, at 100% of the principal amount.
Also, during the nine months ended June 28, 2019, TEGSA issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due June 2020.
The fixed-to-floating rate senior notes and floating rate senior notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.
The Credit Facility was amended in November 2018 primarily to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to November 2023.
TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at June 28, 2019 or September 28, 2018.
TEGSA had no commercial paper outstanding at June 28, 2019.
The fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,295 million and $4,149 million at June 28, 2019 and September 28, 2018, respectively.
We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites.
The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.
As of June 28, 2019, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $15 million to $44 million, and we accrued $18 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range.
At June 28, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $316 million.
We sold our SubCom business during the nine months ended June 28, 2019.
In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to honor certain performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business.
See Note 3 for additional information regarding these guarantees and the divestiture of the SubCom business.
During fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans.
Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make interest payments in euros at 3.50% per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum.
Upon the maturity of these contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.
During fiscal 2019, we expanded our cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations.
The aggregate notional value of the fiscal 2019 contracts was $1,901 million at June 28, 2019.
Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 2.96% per annum and pay no interest.
Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2023, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currencies and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.
The components of net periodic pension benefit cost other than service cost are included in net other income (expense) on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we contributed $29 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.
We recorded an income tax benefit of $245 million and income tax expense of $77 million for the quarters ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018, respectively.
See “Swiss Tax Reform” below for additional information.
We recorded an income tax benefit of $76 million and income tax expense of $784 million for the nine months ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018, respectively.
As of June 28, 2019 and September 28, 2018, we had $40 million and $60 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income taxes.
During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we recognized $17 million of income tax benefit related to interest and penalties on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in September 2018, and it was approved by public vote on May 19, 2019.
The federal provisions of Swiss Tax Reform are expected to be enacted into law in the quarter ending September 27, 2019 and the cantons will implement thereafter.
As a result of this measure, during the quarter ended June 28, 2019, we recorded a $214 million income tax benefit related primarily to the reduction to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.
Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien.
As a result of subsequent transactions, Tyco International and Covidien now operate as part of Johnson Controls International plc and Medtronic plc, respectively.
In March 2019, our shareholders approved the cancellation of 6 million shares purchased under our share repurchase program during the period beginning September 30, 2017 and ending September 28, 2018.
