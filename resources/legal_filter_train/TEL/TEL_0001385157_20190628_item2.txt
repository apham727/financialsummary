●Our net sales decreased 5.4% and 3.2% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2018, with sales declines in the Transportation Solutions and Communications Solutions segments, partially offset by growth in the Industrial Solutions segment.
On an organic basis, our net sales decreased 2.8% and 0.5% during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2018.
●Transportation Solutions—Our net sales decreased 6.8% and 5.6% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, due primarily to sales declines in the automotive end market.
●Industrial Solutions—Our net sales increased 1.7% and 3.4% during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, primarily as a result of increased sales in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market.
●Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,575 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
●Industrial Solutions—We expect our net sales declines in the industrial equipment and energy end markets to be partially offset by growth in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market.
In the industrial equipment end market, sales declines resulting from high inventory levels at distributors are expected to be partially offset by growth in medical applications.
We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.87 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $50 million and $0.03 per share, respectively, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
We expect global automotive production to decline approximately 7% in fiscal 2019.
In the industrial equipment end market, we expect net sales declines resulting from market weakness in industrial applications to be partially offset by growth in medical applications.
We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.42 to $5.48 per share in fiscal 2019.
This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $400 million and $0.16 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.
Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs.
Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“Swiss Tax Reform”) in September 2018, and it was approved by public vote in May 2019.

We are currently assessing the impacts of the federal provisions and subsequent cantonal implementation.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $296 million, net of cash acquired.
The acquisitions were reported as part of our Transportation Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.
In June 2019, we announced our intent to acquire all outstanding shares of First Sensor AG through a voluntary public tender offer.
We expect to complete the transaction in fiscal 2020.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million.
The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was reported as such in all periods presented on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
Net sales decreased $192 million, or 5.4%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 3.4% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies and organic net sales declines of 2.8%.
Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $20 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
The decrease resulted primarily from the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 3.3% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies.
Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $75 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
See further discussion of net sales below under “Segment Results.”
Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period.
Approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 32.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 from 33.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and decreased to 32.9% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from 34.0% in the same period of fiscal 2018.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 10.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 from 11.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and decreased to 11.0% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from 11.3% in the same period of fiscal 2018.
These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.
During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments.
During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments.
In connection with these initiatives, we incurred net restructuring charges of $184 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, of which $179 million related to the fiscal 2019 restructuring program.
Annualized cost savings related to the fiscal 2019 actions commenced during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $145 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2021.
We previously disclosed that we expected total restructuring charges to be approximately $250 million in fiscal 2019.
We have now increased this amount by $125 million.
We currently expect total restructuring charges, which will impact all segments, to be approximately $375 million and total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $165 million in 2019.
See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.
See discussion of operating income below under “Segment Results.”
Interest expense decreased $13 million and $25 million during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, due primarily to the expansion of our cross-currency swap program in fiscal 2019.
Under the terms of the fiscal 2019 contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 2.96% per annum and pay no interest.
See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our cross-currency swap program.

The results for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 represent one month of activity.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, net sales and operating income were negatively impacted by production delays on a program.
See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

●Sensors—Our organic net sales increased 1.8% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 as a result of growth in the industrial equipment market, partially offset by declines in the commercial transportation and automotive markets.
●Industrial equipment—Our organic net sales decreased 5.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 due primarily to reduced demand resulting from high inventory levels at distributors, partially offset by strength in medical applications.
●Aerospace, defense, oil, and gas—Our organic net sales increased 16.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as a result of strength in the commercial aerospace, defense, and oil and gas markets.
●Energy—Our organic net sales were flat in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as declines in the EMEA region were largely offset by strength in the Americas region.

We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $250 million of 2.35% senior notes due in 2019.
We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt.
The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions.
The increase resulted primarily from higher collections of accounts receivable and fluctuations in cash collateral requirements under our cross-currency swap contracts, partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax income levels.
The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 was $277 million and $317 million, respectively.
Capital expenditures were $570 million and $673 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We expect fiscal 2019 capital spending levels to be approximately 5-6% of net sales.
We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $296 million, net of cash acquired.
See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2020, we may, at our option, redeem the fixed-to-floating rate senior notes, as a whole, at 100% of the principal amount.
The fixed-to-floating rate senior notes and floating rate senior notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.
2020 to November 2023.
TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at June 28, 2019 or September 28, 2018.
The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered.
The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.
None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations.
As of June 28, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.
In addition to the Credit Facility, TEGSA is the borrower under our senior notes and commercial paper.

As discussed above, in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business.
In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale.
These guarantees had a combined value of approximately $1.7 billion as of June 28, 2019 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years.
Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years.
See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the SubCom business.

Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any.
Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.
Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance.
It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.
We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations.
The tables presented in “Results of Operations” and “Segment Results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP.
This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.
