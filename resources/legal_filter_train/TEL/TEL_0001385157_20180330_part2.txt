     ITEM 1A.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017 except as described below.
  Changes in United States federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to United States persons treated as owning 10% or more of our shares.
A U.S. person that is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as owning, directly, indirectly, or constructively, 10% or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as CFCs, whether or not we make any distributions to such U.S. shareholder.
The risk of U.S. federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that now are treated as CFCs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us, and others from investing in us, which could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares.
     ITEM 2.
 None.
