 The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) have been prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
In management’s opinion, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of interim results.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018.
 Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are to our fiscal years ending September 27, 2019 and ended September 28, 2018, respectively.
 We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which introduced a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model.
Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control.
We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation.
Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of March 29, 2019.
We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product.
We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations.
This guidance, as subsequently amended, requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for most leases and is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
We are currently in the process of updating policies, internal controls, financial statement disclosures, and systems to incorporate the impact of the new standard in our financial reporting processes.
We intend to adopt the standard using the optional transition method permitted by ASU No.
2018-11, which allows for application of the standard at the adoption date and no restatement of comparative periods.
We believe that we are following an appropriate timeline to allow for the proper recognition, reporting, and disclosure of leases upon adoption of ASC 842 at the beginning of fiscal 2020.
2017-12, an update to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
The update improves and simplifies hedge accounting and related disclosures.
We elected to early adopt this update, which did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in the quarter ended December 28, 2018.
2016-16, an update to ASC 740, Income Taxes.
This guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs.
The update was adopted on a modified retrospective basis in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 and resulted in a $443 million cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings, which represented the net reversal of all balances associated with deferred tax impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
This included a decrease in other assets of $798 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $418 million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $63 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
This guidance supersedes ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and introduces a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model.
ASC 606 also enhances disclosures related to revenue recognition.
We adopted ASC 606, as amended, in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach.
Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
Because the impact of adoption was immaterial, we have not recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings.
 During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments.
In connection with this program, during the six months ended March 29, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $107 million.
We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during the six months ended March 29, 2019 by the end of fiscal 2021 and to incur additional charges of approximately $20 million primarily in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments.
 During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments.
In connection with this program, during the six months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $5 million and $35 million, respectively.
We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2018 by the end of fiscal 2020 and to incur additional charges of approximately $10 million primarily in the Industrial Solutions segment.
 Prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments.
Also prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment.
During the six months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $5 million and $9 million, respectively, related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions.
 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses of $67 million and the guarantee liabilities discussed below.
Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment.
 In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale.
These guarantees had a combined value of approximately $1.7 billion as of March 29, 2019 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years.
At the time of sale, we determined that the fair value of these guarantees was $12 million, which we recognized by a charge to pre-tax loss on sale.
Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years.
During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we issued a guarantee of $70 million for a new project.
 (1) At March 29, 2019 and September 28, 2018, accumulated impairment losses for the Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Communications Solutions segments were $2,191 million, $669 million, and $489 million, respectively.
 Intangible asset amortization expense was $45 million for the quarters ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018 and $90 million for the six months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018.
 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due June 2020.
The notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.
 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, TEGSA repaid, at maturity, $325 million 2.375% senior notes due 2018.
The Credit Facility was amended in November 2018 primarily to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to November 2023.
The amended Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies.
TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at March 29, 2019 or September 28, 2018.
 As of March 29, 2019, TEGSA had $360 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.63%.
 The fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,172 million and $4,149 million at March 29, 2019 and September 28, 2018, respectively.
 We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites.
The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.
 At March 29, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $307 million.
 We sold our SubCom business during the six months ended March 29, 2019.
In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to honor certain performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business.
See Note 3 for additional information regarding these guarantees and the divestiture of the SubCom business.
 During fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans.
Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make interest payments in euros at 3.50% per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum.
Upon the maturity of these contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.
 During fiscal 2019, we expanded our cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations.
The aggregate notional value of the fiscal 2019 contracts was $1,901 million at March 29, 2019.
Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 3.00% per annum and pay no interest.
Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2023, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currencies and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.
The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $3,415 million and $4,064 million at March 29, 2019 and September 28, 2018, respectively.
 (1) Foreign currency exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans and external borrowings are recorded as currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and are offset by changes attributable to the translation of the net investment.
 (2) Gains and losses on cross-currency swap contracts designated as hedges of net investment are recorded as currency translation.
 The components of net periodic pension benefit cost other than service cost are included in net other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we contributed $19 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.
 We recorded income tax expense of $91 million and $108 million for the quarters ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, respectively.
 We recorded income tax expense of $169 million and $707 million for the six months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, respectively.
Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien.
As a result of subsequent transactions, Tyco International and Covidien now operate as part of Johnson Controls International plc and Medtronic plc, respectively.
