The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on EBIT, and provides EBIT on a consolidated basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, above. EBIT was $26.9 million (13.4% of net sales) for the third quarter of 2019 compared to $25.6 million (13.3% of net sales) for the third quarter of 2018. For the first nine months of 2019, EBIT was $75.3 million (13.1% of net sales) compared to $56.2 million (10.4% of net sales) for the first nine months of 2018.
The following table presents a reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings.
EBIT in the third quarter of 2019 was $5.9 million (14.0% of net sales) compared to $5.9 million (13.1% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2018. EBIT in the first nine months of 2019 was $14.8 million (11.7% of net sales) compared to $13.8 million (11.2% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2018. The increase in EBIT in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 was primarily due to the increased sales volumes mainly from the segment’s Asian operations.

EBIT in the third quarter of 2019 was $1.6 million (7.6% of net sales) compared to $2.5 million (11.4% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2018.

These charges consisted primarily of severance and compensation benefits and asset impairment charges.
Interest expense was $2.0 million and $5.9 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and $2.2 million and $6.5 million in the corresponding periods of 2018.

Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased to $250.5 million at June 30, 2019 from $195.5 million at September 30, 2018. Inventories decreased by $8.6 million during this period mainly due to a $12.7 million decrease within the Filtration segment resulting primarily from the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Contract assets increased $46.5 million in the first nine months of 2019 mainly due to the adoption of ASC 606 within the Filtration segment.
Capital expenditures were $26.5 million and $15.5 million in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the first nine months of 2019 was mainly due to a $9.1 million facility expansion at TEQ.

various updates that amend and clarify the impact and implementation of the aforementioned update. These updates require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. Upon initial application, the provisions of these updates are required to be applied using the modified retrospective method which requires retrospective adoption to each prior reporting period presented with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded to the earliest reporting period presented. An optional transition method can be utilized which requires retrospective adoption beginning on the date of adoption with the cumulative effect of initially applying these updates recognized at the date of initial adoption. These updates also expand the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We expect to adopt these updates on October 1, 2019 using the optional transition method. We continue to evaluate the impact these updates will have on our consolidated financial statements. Based upon the analysis and preliminary evaluation of the standard, we estimate the adoption will result in the addition of assets and liabilities of less than $30 million to our consolidated balance sheet, with no significant change to our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. We believe the updates will also have an impact on our accounting policies, internal controls and disclosures related to leases.
