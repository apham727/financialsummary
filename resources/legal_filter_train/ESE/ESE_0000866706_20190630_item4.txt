As previously disclosed in Part II Item 9A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018, management concluded there was a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting related to the ineffective design and operation of controls impacting the deferred revenue general ledger account. Remedial actions have been identified to address these controls, including enhancing our policies and procedures related to the deferred revenue reconciliation and review, and providing additional training to our segment finance department. These new procedures are in the process of being implemented but have not been in place long enough to provide sufficient assurances to support the conclusion that the above identified material weakness has been fully remediated as of June 30, 2019.
