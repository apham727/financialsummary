2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (ASU 2014-09) which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
This guidance has been further clarified and amended.
Because the new standard impacts the Company’s business processes, systems and controls, we developed a project plan to guide the implementation.
This project plan included analyzing the standard’s impact on our contract portfolio, comparing our historical accounting policies and practices to the requirements of the new standard, and identifying differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to our contracts.
We developed internal controls to ensure that we adequately evaluated our portfolio of contracts under the five-step model to ensure proper assessment of our operating results under ASU 2014-09.
We reported on the progress of the implementation to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors on a regular basis during the project’s duration.
This standard will not change the total revenue or operating earnings recognized, only the timing of when those amounts are recognized.
The Company is currently in the process of finalizing the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
