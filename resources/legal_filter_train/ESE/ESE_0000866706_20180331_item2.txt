Interest expense was $2.0 million and $4.2 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, and $0.9 million and $1.5 million in the corresponding periods of 2017.
The increase in interest expense in the first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding period of 2017 was mainly due to higher average outstanding borrowings ($264 million compared to $167 million) and higher average interest rates (2.9% vs. 1.8%) as a result of the additional borrowings to fund the Company’s recent acquisitions.

This favorable adjustment, net of the $0.3 million unfavorable impact to the 2017 Domestic Production Deduction, favorably impacted the second quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 5.8% and 3.0%, respectively.
The income tax expense in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was also unfavorably impacted by the cancellation of debt income triggered by the dissolution of a foreign subsidiary increasing the second quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 1.5% and 0.8%, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded reasonable estimates of the TCJA income tax effects.
In the second quarter of 2018, the Company was unable to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740 for the change in the value of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as it needs more time to collect and analyze information primarily related to depreciation expense, pension liability (see provisional adjustment described above), and percentage of completion revenue recognition.
The accounting for these items will be completed within the allotted measurement period.
The Company is evaluating these considerations to determine the amount of its foreign subsidiaries’ cumulative earnings it intends to indefinitely reinvest.
The TCJA includes a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”).
Because there are interpretative questions associated with the approach that involves recognizing deferred taxes, the Company is in the process of evaluating and will make the accounting policy election during the SAB 118 measurement period.
