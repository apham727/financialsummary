Net sales increased $40.8 million, or 13.2%, to $348.3 million in the first six months of 2018 from $307.5 million in the first six months of 2017. The increase in net sales in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to the second quarter of 2017 was due to a $14.0 million increase in the USG segment, a $2.4 million increase in the Test segment and a $0.3 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment, partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in the Filtration segment. The increase in net sales in the first six months of 2018 as compared to the corresponding prior year period was due to a $34.3 million increase in the USG segment, a $6.2 million increase in the Test segment and a $2.2 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in the Filtration segment. 
In the second quarter of 2018, net sales of $40.8 million were $2.4 million, or 6.3%, higher than the $38.4 million recorded in the second quarter of 2017.

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on EBIT, and provides EBIT on a consolidated basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, above.

For the first six months of 2018, EBIT was $30.6 million (8.8% of net sales) compared to $34.5 million (11.2% of net sales) for the first six months of 2017. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings. 
EBIT in the second quarter of 2018 was $5.3 million (13.0% of net sales) compared to $3.8 million (9.8% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first six months of 2018 was $7.9 million (10.1% of net sales) compared to $6.2 million (8.6% of net sales) in the first six months of 2017. The increase in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods was primarily due to the increased sales volumes mainly from the segment’s U.S. operations. 
EBIT in the second quarter of 2018 was $5.6 million (12.0% of net sales) compared to $7.4 million (22.8% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first six months of 2018 was $16.3 million (15.9% of net sales) compared to EBIT of $17.1 million (25.1% of net sales) in the first six months of 2017. The decrease in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was mainly due to the restructuring charges incurred in the second quarter of 2018 and product mix. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company incurred $1.9 million of charges related to closing the Doble facilities in Norway and China consisting mainly of employee severance and compensation benefits, professional fees, and asset impairment charges. 
Corporate costs included in EBIT were $8.3 million and $17.2 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $7.3 million and $14.4 million in the corresponding periods of 2017. The increase in Corporate costs in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to higher professional fees and an increase in amortization of intangible assets related to recent acquisitions. 
The Company’s overall financial position and liquidity remains strong. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased to $205.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $197.8 million at September 30, 2017. Inventories increased by $12.5 million during this period mainly due to a $6.2 million increase within the Filtration segment primarily to support new aerospace platforms and a $4.1 million increase within the USG segment. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on long-term contracts decreased $7.0 million in the first six months of 2018 due to ETS-Lindgren ($4.7 million) and VACCO ($2.3 million). 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $33.0 million and $36.7 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2018 as compared to the first six months of 2017 was due to higher working capital requirements. 
Capital expenditures were $10.1 million and $15.4 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the first six months of 2018 was mainly due to a decrease in machinery and equipment at Plastique ($3.0 million) and VACCO ($1.6 million). In addition, the Company incurred expenditures for capitalized software of $4.6 million and $3.4 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which updates ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits. This update permits only the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement expense to be reported with other compensation costs, while all other components are required to be reported separately in other deductions, outside any subtotal of operating income. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted on a retrospective basis. The updates change presentation only and will not impact the Company’s results of operations. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-062, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This standard will increase an entities’ reported assets and liabilities. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition period for all entities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This guidance has been further clarified and amended. The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has selected the Cumulative Effect method of transition to the new standard.
