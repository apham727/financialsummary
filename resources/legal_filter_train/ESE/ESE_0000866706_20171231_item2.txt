The increase in net earnings and diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to the $25.1 million net tax benefit the Company recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. 
Net sales increased $27.1 million, or 18.5%, to $173.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $146.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net sales in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 was due to a $20.2 million increase in the USG segment, a $3.7 million increase in the Test segment, a $2.0 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment and a $1.2 million increase in the Filtration segment. 
In the first quarter of 2018, net sales of $37.5 million were $3.7 million, or 10.9%, higher than the $33.8 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to higher sales from the segment’s U.S. operations due to the timing of test and measurement chamber projects. 
Net sales increased $20.2 million, or 56.8%, to $55.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $35.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly driven by the $19 million sales contribution from the NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard acquisitions and new products and software solutions at Doble. 
In the first quarter of 2018, net sales of $20.2 million were $2.0 million, or 10.9% higher than the $18.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017.

Amortization expenses consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily software).

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on EBIT, and provides EBIT on a consolidated basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, above. EBIT was $15.0 million (8.6% of net sales) for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $16.8 million (11.5% of net sales) for the first quarter of 2017. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings. 
EBIT in the first quarter of 2018 was $9.6 million (16.1% of net sales) compared to $10.7 million (18.2% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in EBIT dollars and as a percent of net sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to lower sales volumes at Westland, PTI and Crissair, partially offset by an increase in EBIT at Mayday and VACCO due to increased sales volumes at these subsidiaries.  
EBIT in the first quarter of 2018 was $2.6 million (6.9% of net sales) compared to $2.4 million (7.2% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2017. EBIT increased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to increased sales volumes. 
EBIT in the first quarter of 2018 was $10.7 million (19.1% of net sales) compared to $9.7 million (27.1% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in EBIT in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to higher sales volumes as well as the EBIT contribution from NRG (May 8, 2017 acquisition), Morgan Schaffer (May 25, 2017 acquisition) and Vanguard (August 30, 2017 acquisition). The decrease in EBIT as a percent of net sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the change in product mix as a result of the recent acquisitions of NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard. 
EBIT in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.0 million (4.8% of net sales) compared to $1.0 million (5.7% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in EBIT as a percent of net sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly due to product mix at Plastique. 
Corporate costs included in EBIT were $8.9 million and $7.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in Corporate costs in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to higher professional fees and an increase in amortization of intangible assets related to recent acquisitions. 
The TCJA includes a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”). The Company expects it will be subject to this tax. At its January 10, 2018 meeting, the FASB staff indicated that companies should make and disclose a policy election as to whether they will recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI or whether they will account for GILTI as period costs if and when incurred. Because there are interpretative questions associated with the approach that involves recognizing deferred taxes, the Company will undertake an evaluation of these questions and make the accounting policy election during the SAB 118 measurement period. 
The Company’s overall financial position and liquidity remains strong. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) decreased to $195.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $197.8 million at September 30, 2017. Accounts receivable decreased $12.1 million primarily related to an $11.9 million decrease within the Filtration segment due to timing of collections and lower sales volumes in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Inventories increased by $6.1 million during this period mainly due to a $3.3 million increase within the Filtration segment to support new aerospace platforms. 
At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $181 million available to borrow under its Credit Facility, a $250 million increase option, and $41.6 million cash on hand. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $260.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility in addition to outstanding letters of credit of $9.0 million. Cash flow from operations and borrowings under the Company’s Credit Facility are expected to meet the Company’s capital requirements and operational needs for the foreseeable future. The Company’s ability to access the additional $250 million increase option of the facility is subject to acceptance by participating or other outside banks. 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which updates ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits. This update permits only the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement expense to be reported with other compensation costs, while all other components are required to be reported separately in other deductions, outside any subtotal of operating income. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted on a retrospective basis. The updates change presentation only and will not impact the Company’s results of operations. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-062, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This standard will increase an entities’ reported assets and liabilities. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition period for all entities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This guidance has been further clarified and amended. The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has selected the Cumulative Effect method of transition to the new standard.
