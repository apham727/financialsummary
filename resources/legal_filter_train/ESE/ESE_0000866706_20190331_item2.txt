EBIT in the first six months of 2019 was $8.9 million (10.5% of net sales) compared to $7.9 million (10.1% of net sales) in the first six months of 2018.

EBIT in the second quarter of 2019 was $1.6 million (7.1% of net sales) compared to $1.9 million (8.8% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2018. EBIT in the first six months of 2019 was $1.7 million (4.1% of net sales) compared to $2.9 million (6.8% of net sales) in the first six months of 2018. The decrease in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 was mainly due to the restructuring charges incurred related to the Plastique facility consolidation, ($0.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $0.7 million in the first six months of 2019). These charges consisted primarily of severance and compensation benefits and asset impairment charges. 
Interest expense was $1.9 million and $3.8 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, and $2.0 million and $4.2 million in the corresponding periods of 2018. The decrease in interest expense in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 was mainly due to lower average outstanding borrowings ($215 million compared to $264 million).

The effective income tax rate for the first six months of 2019 was 19.0% compared to (69.3%) for the first six months of 2018.

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2019 as compared to the first six months of 2018 was due to higher working capital requirements. 
Capital expenditures were $17.4 million and $10.1 million in the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the first six months of 2019 was mainly due to a $7.1 million facility expansion at TEQ.
