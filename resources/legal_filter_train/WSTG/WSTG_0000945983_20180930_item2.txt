 Item 2.
Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2018.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The “Lifeboat Distribution” segment distributes technical software to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide.
The “TechXtend” segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada.
 We derive the majority of our net sales though the sale of third party software licenses, maintenance and service agreements.
In our TechXtend segment sales are generally driven by sales force effectiveness and success in providing superior customer service, competitive pricing, and flexible payment solutions to our customers.
 Dividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program.
Total dividends paid and shares repurchased were $0.8 million and $0.02 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, respectively, and $0.8 million and $0.1 million for the quarter
ended September 30, 2017, respectively.
 Stock Volatility.
The technology sector of the United States stock markets is subject to substantial volatility.
 We adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers on retrospective basis effective January 1, 2018.
Under ASC 606 net sales for certain maintenance, service and security products we sell are recorded net of the related cost of sales.
We refer to these items as being recorded on a “net basis” in the discussion below.
Software and hardware products for which sales and cost of sales are reported on separate line items are referred to as being recorded on a gross basis.
 This report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 The Company operates in a rapidly changing business, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
The Company reported net income of $1.3 million for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
 On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.
See Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements for further information.
The Company makes estimates regarding performance obligations inherent in the products and services it sells including, whether ongoing maintenance obligations performed by third party vendors are distinct from the related software licenses, and allocation of sales prices among distinct performance obligations.
These estimates require significant judgement to determine whether the software’s functionality is dependent on ongoing maintenance or if substantially all functionality is available in the original software download.
We also use judgement in the allocation of sales proceeds among performance obligations, utilizing observable data such as stand-alone selling prices, or market pricing for similar products and services.
 The Company’s accounts receivable long-term are discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale based on prevailing rates.
In doing so, the Company considers competitive market rates and other factors.
At times the Company sells receivables to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis.
The net proceeds from such sales are included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows as changes in accounts receivable.
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-offs may be required.
 The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets.
In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
 Under the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
We record the impact of forfeitures when they occur.
Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.
ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
Leases will be classified as either finance or operating leases with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of earnings.
The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
It is expected that assets and liabilities will increase as a result of the adoption of this standard.
2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No.
2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded.
2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No.
2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements, particularly its recognition for accounts receivable.
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (“ASU 2016-15”) which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.
The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
The ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019.
Early adoption is permitted in fiscal 2018 with modified retrospective application.
The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-09, “Scope of Modification Accounting”, to reduce diversity in practice and provide clarity regarding existing guidance in ASC 718, “Stock Compensation”.
The amendments in this updated guidance clarify that an entity should apply modification accounting in response to a change in the terms and conditions of an entity’s share-based payment awards unless three newly specified criteria are met.
The new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018 and did not impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not the Company’s practice to change either the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted.
 In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements.
The amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current U.S. GAAP.
The Company is currently assessing the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
 In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (SEC Update), Income Taxes (Topic 740).
The Company completed its Federal and State income tax filings for 2017 with no material change to amounts previously reported.
 In June 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2018-07, “Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which aligns the measurement and classification guidance for share-based payments to nonemployees with that for employees, with certain exceptions.
It expands the scope of ASC 718 to include share-based payments granted to nonemployees in exchange for goods or services used or consumed in the entity’s own operations and supersedes the guidance in ASC 505-50.
The ASU retains the existing cost attribution guidance, which requires entities to recognize compensation cost for nonemployee awards in the same period and in the same manner (i.e., capitalize or expense) they would if they paid cash for the goods or services, but it moves the guidance to ASC 718.
The guidance also allows nonpublic entities to account for nonemployee awards using certain practical expedients that are already available for employee awards, but the same accounting policies must be used for awards to both employees and nonemployees.
ASU 2018-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.
 In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09 – Codification Improvements, which facilitates amendments to a variety of topics to clarify, correct errors in, or make minor improvements to the accounting standards codification.
The effective date of the standard is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each amendment.
Some amendments do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon the issuance of this standard.
We will be required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include net sales, gross margin, adjusted gross billings, gross profit as a percentage of gross billings, net income as a percentage of net sales, net income as a percentage of gross billings, and net income excluding separation expenses, net of taxes.
 We define adjusted gross billings as net sales in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted for the cost of sales related to Software – security or highly interdependent with support and maintenance, support or other services.
We provided a reconciliation of adjusted gross billings to net sales, which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.
In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate Adjusted gross billings of product and services or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.
 We use net income excluding separation payments as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into comparison of our businesses profitability when compared to the prior year.
In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate separation expenses net of tax, or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.
 Net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased 23%, or $8.9 million, to $47.9 million, compared to $39.0 million for the same period in 2017.
Adjusted gross billings for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased 26%, or $27.3 million, to $134.0 million, compared to $106.6 million for the same period in 2017.
 Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased $9.4 million, or 27% to $44.1 million, compared to $34.7 million for the same period a year earlier.
The increase was due primarily to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines, as well as the addition of several new product lines.
While the tenure of our vendor relationships is generally for multiple years, the contractual terms of the distribution agreements themselves are short term in nature and vendors consolidate or change their relationships for various reasons.
Adjusted gross billings for the Lifeboat Distribution segment increased $21.8 million or 22% to $122.0 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2018.
 TechXtend segment net sales decreased $0.5 million or 12% to $3.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, compared to $4.3 million for the prior year.
Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $5.5 million or 86% to $12.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 52.9% of our net sales.
One of these customers accounted for 37.3% and the other for 15.6% of our total net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2018.
 Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased slightly to $6.3 million, compared to $6.2 million for the same period in 2017.
TechXtend segment gross profit decreased 20% to $0.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 compared to $0.8 million for the same period in the prior year due to the lower net sales discussed above.
 Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 was 13.2% compared to 16.0% in 2017.
Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 12.8% for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, compared to 15.6% in 2017.
TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 was 17.6%, compared to 19.2% in 2017.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018 approximately 8.0% of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 8.9% in 2017.
This shift in product mix had the effect of reducing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 100 basis points.
 For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.4 million, compared to $0.7 million for the same period in 2017.
The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.2% for the three months ending September 30, 2018, compared to 33.3% during the same period in the prior year.
 Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the TCJA we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of September 30, 2018.
Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts.
The accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed in 2018.
 Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 14%, or $16.2 million, to $132.4 million, compared to $116.1 million for the same period in 2017.
Adjusted gross billings for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 16%, or $53.2 million, to $375.6 million, compared to $322.4 million for the same period in 2017.
 Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $15.4 million, or 15% to $119.3 million, compared to $103.9 million for the same period a year earlier.
While the tenure of our vendor relationships is generally for multiple years, the contractual terms of the distribution agreements themselves are short term in nature and vendors consolidate or change their relationships for various reasons.
Approximately 9.3% of our net sales were recorded on a net basis compared to 10.1% in the same period of the prior year.
Adjusted gross billings for the Lifeboat Distribution segment increased $42.7 million or 14% to $343.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
 TechXtend segment net sales increased $0.8 million or 7% to $13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $12.3 million for the prior year.
Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $10.5 million or 48% to $32.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 44.0% of our net sales.
One major customer accounted for 27.5% and the other for 16.5%, of our total net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
TechXtend segment gross profit decreased 4% to $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $2.7 million for the same period in the prior year due to the decreased net sales discussed above.
 Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 14.9% compared to 16.9% in 2017.
Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 14.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to 16.2% in 2017.
TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 19.9%, compared to 22.1% in 2017.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 approximately 9.3% of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 10.1% in 2017.
This shift in product mix had the effect of reducing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 80 basis points.
 Separation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $2.4 million compared to no expense in the same period in 2017.
The increase is due to $2.4 million in separation expenses related to the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 11, 2018, consisting of a $1.7 million charge for accelerated vesting of restricted stock and $0.8 million in accrued payments to be made over the next twelve months.
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.0 million, compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2017.
The company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was impacted by limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation resulting from section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and adjustments to the accrual for state income taxes in states which have enacted economic nexus statutes.
The Company recorded a $0.4 million tax benefit related to separation expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 which were accounted for as a discrete item, resulting in a 18% effective tax benefit rate on that expense.
The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.2% for the nine months ending September 30, 2018, compared to 32.2% during the same period in the prior year.
 Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the TCJA we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of September 30, 2018.
As we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the TCJA and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts.
The accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed in 2018.
 Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.0 million to $6.5 million at September 30, 2018 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2017.
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $4.6 million, comprised primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $4.8 million, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.2 million.
Net cash provided by changes in working capital increased slightly as increases in accounts receivables were offset by lower inventory and utilization of vendor prepayments.
The Credit Facility, which will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, matures on August 31, 2020, at which time the Company must pay all outstanding principal of all outstanding loans plus all accrued and unpaid interest, and any interest, fees, costs and expenses, if any.
As of September 30, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility.
 We anticipate that our working capital needs will increase as we invest in the growth of our business.
We believe that the funds held in cash and cash equivalents and our unused borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.
The commitments for operating leases include the minimum rent payments.
 As of September 30, 2018, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under our lines of credit and no commitments relating to standby letters of credit, and has no standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments (see Note 8 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).
