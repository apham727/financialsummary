 The Company is organized into two reportable operating segments. The “Lifeboat Distribution” segment distributes technical software to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide. The “TechXtend” segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada.  
 We derive the majority of our net sales though the sale of third party software licenses, maintenance and service agreements. In our Lifeboat distribution segment, sales are impacted by the number of product lines we distribute, and sales penetration of those products into the reseller channel. In our TechXtend segment sales are generally driven by sales force effectiveness and success in providing superior customer service, competitive pricing, and flexible payment solutions to our customers. Our sales are also impacted by external factors such as levels of IT spending and customer demand for products we distribute.  
 Dividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program. Historically we have sought to return value to investors through the payment of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Total dividends paid and shares repurchased were $0.8 million and $0.02 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, respectively, and $0.8 million and $0.1 million for the quarter 
 We adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers on retrospective basis effective January 1, 2018. Under ASC 606 net sales for certain maintenance, service and security products we sell are recorded net of the related cost of sales. We refer to these items as being recorded on a “net basis” in the discussion below. Software and hardware products for which sales and cost of sales are reported on separate line items are referred to as being recorded on a gross basis.  
 On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.  
 The Company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates.  
 The Company adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with customers using the full retrospective method effective January 1, 2018. See Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements for further information. The Company makes estimates regarding performance obligations inherent in the products and services it sells including, whether ongoing maintenance obligations performed by third party vendors are distinct from the related software licenses, and allocation of sales prices among distinct performance obligations. These estimates require significant judgement to determine whether the software’s functionality is dependent on ongoing maintenance or if substantially all functionality is available in the original software download. We also use judgement in the allocation of sales proceeds among performance obligations, utilizing observable data such as stand-alone selling prices, or market pricing for similar products and services.  
 The Company’s accounts receivable long-term are discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale based on prevailing rates. In doing so, the Company considers competitive market rates and other factors. At times the Company sells receivables to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis. The net proceeds from such sales are included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows as changes in accounts receivable.  
 The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-offs may be required.  
 The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.  
 Under the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We record the impact of forfeitures when they occur. We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock-based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease guidance under FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating leases with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of earnings. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. It is expected that assets and liabilities will increase as a result of the adoption of this standard.  
 In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No. 2016-13"). ASU No. 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements, particularly its recognition for accounts receivable.   
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (“ASU 2016-15”) which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  
consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted in fiscal 2018 with modified retrospective application. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, “Scope of Modification Accounting”, to reduce diversity in practice and provide clarity regarding existing guidance in ASC 718, “Stock Compensation”. The amendments in this updated guidance clarify that an entity should apply modification accounting in response to a change in the terms and conditions of an entity’s share-based payment awards unless three newly specified criteria are met. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018 and did not impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not the Company’s practice to change either the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted.  
 In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current U.S. GAAP. ASU No. 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; the ASU allows for early adoption in any interim period after issuance of the update. The Company is currently assessing the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In June 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-07, “Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which aligns the measurement and classification guidance for share-based payments to nonemployees with that for employees, with certain exceptions. It expands the scope of ASC 718 to include share-based payments granted to nonemployees in exchange for goods or services used or consumed in the entity’s own operations and supersedes the guidance in ASC 505-50. The ASU retains the existing cost attribution guidance, which requires entities to recognize compensation cost for nonemployee awards in the same period and in the same manner (i.e., capitalize or expense) they would if they paid cash for the goods or services, but it moves the guidance to ASC 718. The guidance also allows nonpublic entities to account for nonemployee awards using certain practical expedients that are already available for employee awards, but the same accounting policies must be used for awards to both employees and nonemployees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.  
 In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09 – Codification Improvements, which facilitates amendments to a variety of topics to clarify, correct errors in, or make minor improvements to the accounting standards codification. The effective date of the standard is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each amendment. Some amendments do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon the issuance of this standard. A majority of the amendments in ASU 2018-09 will be effective in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We will be required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
 We define adjusted gross billings as net sales in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted for the cost of sales related to Software – security or highly interdependent with support and maintenance, support or other services. We provided a reconciliation of adjusted gross billings to net sales, which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. We use adjusted gross billings of product and services as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into the volume of business generated by our business, and to analyze the changes to our accounts receivable and accounts payable. Our use of adjusted gross billings of product and services as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate Adjusted gross billings of product and services or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.  
 We use net income excluding separation payments as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into comparison of our businesses profitability when compared to the prior year. Our use of net income excluding separation expenses, net of tax has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate separation expenses net of tax, or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.  
 Net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased 23%, or $8.9 million, to $47.9 million, compared to $39.0 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted gross billings for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased 26%, or $27.3 million, to $134.0 million, compared to $106.6 million for the same period in 2017.   
 Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased $9.4 million, or 27% to $44.1 million, compared to $34.7 million for the same period a year earlier. The increase was due primarily to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines, as well as the addition of several new product lines. The increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and customer accounts, including the termination of one of our vendor distribution agreements that accounted for less than 10% of net sales. While the tenure of our vendor relationships is generally for multiple years, the contractual terms of the distribution agreements themselves are short term in nature and vendors consolidate or change their relationships for various reasons. We operate in a competitive market in which vendor distribution and sales agreements are subject to turnover due to competitive bidding processes and other factors. Adjusted gross billings for the Lifeboat Distribution segment increased $21.8 million or 22% to $122.0 million for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2018. Net sales increased at a higher rate than adjusted gross billings due to the impact of reporting certain products on a net basis.  
 TechXtend segment net sales decreased $0.5 million or 12% to $3.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, compared to $4.3 million for the prior year. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers and internal capital allocation decisions regarding capital we allocate to the extended payment program. Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $5.5 million or 86% to $12.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.   
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 52.9% of our net sales. One of these customers accounted for 37.3% and the other for 15.6% of our total net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2018. These same customers accounted for 40.6% and 8.8% of total net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2018.  
 Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased slightly to $6.3 million, compared to $6.2 million for the same period in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit increased 4% or $0.2 million to $5.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 compared $5.4 million for the same period in 2017 due to the impact of the higher net sales discussed above, partially offset by lower gross profit margin. TechXtend segment gross profit decreased 20% to $0.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 compared to $0.8 million for the same period in the prior year due to the lower net sales discussed above.   
 Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 was 13.2% compared to 16.0% in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 12.8% for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, compared to 15.6% in 2017. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 was 17.6%, compared to 19.2% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily caused by lower gross profit margins as a percent of net sales for hardware and software product sales which are reported on a gross basis and a change in the percentage mix of our products which are recorded net of the related cost of sales. During the three months ended September 30, 2018 approximately 8.0% of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 8.9% in 2017. This shift in product mix had the effect of reducing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 100 basis points. The remainder of the decline was caused by lower gross profit margin on software and hardware products recorded on a gross basis, as growth in these products was primarily from high volume lines which are sold at lower gross profit margin than our average gross profit. We operate in a competitive environment where the trend has been and may continue to be for gross profit margins as a percentage of adjusted gross billings to decline.   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.4 million, compared to $0.7 million for the same period in 2017. The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.2% for the three months ending September 30, 2018, compared to 33.3% during the same period in the prior year.   
 Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the TCJA we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of September 30, 2018. As we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the TCJA and any additional guidance issued by the Internal 
 Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 14%, or $16.2 million, to $132.4 million, compared to $116.1 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted gross billings for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 16%, or $53.2 million, to $375.6 million, compared to $322.4 million for the same period in 2017.   
 Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $15.4 million, or 15% to $119.3 million, compared to $103.9 million for the same period a year earlier. The increase was due primarily to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines, the addition of several new product lines, as well as product mix resulting in an increased percent of our sales being reported on a gross basis. The increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and customer accounts, including the termination of one of our vendor distribution agreements that accounted for less than 10% of net sales. While the tenure of our vendor relationships is generally for multiple years, the contractual terms of the distribution agreements themselves are short term in nature and vendors consolidate or change their relationships for various reasons. We operate in a competitive market in which vendor distribution and sales agreements are subject to turnover due to competitive bidding processes and other factors. Approximately 9.3% of our net sales were recorded on a net basis compared to 10.1% in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted gross billings for the Lifeboat Distribution segment increased $42.7 million or 14% to $343.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Adjusted gross billings increased at a lower rate than net sales due to the impact of recording sales for certain products net of the related cost of sales.  
 TechXtend segment net sales increased $0.8 million or 7% to $13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $12.3 million for the prior year. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers and internal capital allocation decisions regarding capital we allocate to the extended payment program. Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $10.5 million or 48% to $32.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 44.0% of our net sales. One major customer accounted for 27.5% and the other for 16.5%, of our total net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. These same customers accounted for 40.6% and 8.8% of total net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2018.  
 Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased slightly to $19.7 million, compared to $19.6 million for the same period in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit increased 1% or $0.2 million to $17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared $16.9 million for the same period in 2017 due to higher net sales which were partially offset by the impact of lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales (discussed below). TechXtend segment gross profit decreased 4% to $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $2.7 million for the same period in the prior year due to the decreased net sales discussed above.   
 Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 14.9% compared to 16.9% in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 14.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to 16.2% in 2017. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 19.9%, compared to 22.1% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily caused by lower gross profit margins on hardware and software products and a change in the percentage mix of our products which are recorded net of the related cost of sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 approximately 9.3% of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 10.1% in 2017. This shift in product mix had the effect of reducing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 80 basis points. The remainder of the decline was caused by lower gross profit margin on software and hardware products recorded on a gross basis, as growth in these products was primarily from high volume 
 Separation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $2.4 million compared to no expense in the same period in 2017. The increase is due to $2.4 million in separation expenses related to the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 11, 2018, consisting of a $1.7 million charge for accelerated vesting of restricted stock and $0.8 million in accrued payments to be made over the next twelve months.   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.0 million, compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2017. The company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was impacted by limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation resulting from section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and adjustments to the accrual for state income taxes in states which have enacted economic nexus statutes. The Company recorded a $0.4 million tax benefit related to separation expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 which were accounted for as a discrete item, resulting in a 18% effective tax benefit rate on that expense. We also adjusted our provision for state income taxes in states with economic nexus statutes by $0.2. The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.2% for the nine months ending September 30, 2018, compared to 32.2% during the same period in the prior year.   
 Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.0 million to $6.5 million at September 30, 2018 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in cash was primarily the result of $4.6 million in cash provided by operating activities offset by $3.3 million of cash used for dividends and stock repurchases.  
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $4.6 million, comprised primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $4.8 million, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.2 million. Net cash provided by changes in working capital increased slightly as increases in accounts receivables were offset by lower inventory and utilization of vendor prepayments.  
 We anticipate that our working capital needs will increase as we invest in the growth of our business. We believe that the funds held in cash and cash equivalents and our unused borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  
 As of September 30, 2018, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under our lines of credit and no commitments relating to standby letters of credit, and has no standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments (see Note 8 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).
