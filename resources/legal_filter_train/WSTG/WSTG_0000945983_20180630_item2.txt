 The Company is organized into two reportable operating segments. The “Lifeboat Distribution” segment distributes technical software to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide. The “TechXtend” segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada.  
 We derive the majority of our net sales though the sale of third party software licenses, maintenance and service agreements. In our Lifeboat distribution segment, sales are impacted by the number of product lines we distribute, and sales penetration of those products into the reseller channel. In our TechXtend segment sales are generally driven by sales force effectiveness and success in providing superior customer service, competitive pricing, and flexible payment solutions to our customers. Our sales are also impacted by external factors such as levels of IT spending and customer demand for products we distribute.  
 Selling general and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of employee salaries, commissions and other employee related expenses, facility costs, costs to maintain our IT infrastructure, public company compliance costs and professional fees. We monitor our level of accounts payable, inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover which are measures of how efficiently we utilize capital in our business.  
 Dividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program. Historically we have sought to return value to investors through the payment of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Total dividends paid and shares repurchased were $0.8 and $0.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and $0.8 million and $0.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, respectively. The payment of future dividends and share repurchases is at the discretion of our Board of Directors 
 On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.  
 The Company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates.  
 The Company adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with customers using the full retrospective method effective January 1, 2018. See Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements for further information. The Company makes estimates regarding performance obligations inherent in the products and services it sells including, whether ongoing maintenance obligations performed by third party vendors are distinct from the related software licenses, and allocation of sales prices among distinct performance obligations. These estimates require significant judgement to determine whether the software’s functionality is dependent on ongoing maintenance or if substantially all functionality is available in the original software download. We also use judgement in the allocation of sales proceeds among performance obligations, utilizing observable data such as stand-alone selling prices, or market pricing for similar products and services.  
 The Company’s accounts receivable long-term are discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale based on prevailing rates. In doing so, the Company considers competitive market rates and other factors. At times the Company sells receivables to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis. The net proceeds from such sales are included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows as changes in accounts receivable.  
 The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-offs may be required.  
 The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.  
 Under the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We record the impact of forfeitures when they occur. We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.  
 In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No. 2016-13"). ASU No. 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements, particularly its recognition for accounts receivable.   
consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted in fiscal 2018 with modified retrospective application. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, “Scope of Modification Accounting”, to reduce diversity in practice and provide clarity regarding existing guidance in ASC 718, “Stock Compensation”. The amendments in this updated guidance clarify that an entity should apply modification accounting in response to a change in the terms and conditions of an entity’s share-based payment awards unless three newly specified criteria are met. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018 and did not impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not the Company’s practice to change either the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted.  
 In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current U.S. GAAP. ASU No. 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; the ASU allows for early adoption in any interim period after issuance of the update. The Company is currently assessing the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
 We define adjusted gross billings as net sales in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted for the cost of sales related to Software – security and highly interdependent with support and Maintenance, support and other services. We provided a reconciliation of Adjusted gross billings to net sales, which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. We use Adjusted gross billings of product and services as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into the volume of business generated by our business, and to analyze the changes to our accounts receivable and accounts payable. Our use of Adjusted gross billings of product and services as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate Adjusted gross billings of product and services or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.  
 We use Net income excluding separation payments as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into comparison of our businesses profitability when compared to the prior year. Our use of Net income excluding separation expenses, net of tax has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate separation expenses net of tax, or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.  
 Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased 13%, or $4.9 million, to $43.9 million, compared to $39.0 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted gross billings for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased 13%, or $13.6 million, to $116.6 million, compared to $103.0 million for the same period in 2017.   
 Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased $3.0 million, or 8% to $38.3 million, compared to $35.3 million for the same period a year earlier. The increase was due primarily to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines, as well as the addition of several new product lines. The increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and customer accounts, including the termination of one of our vendor distribution agreements that accounted for less than 10% of net sales. While the tenure of our vendor relationships is generally for multiple years, the distribution agreements themselves are short term in nature and vendors consolidate or change their relationships for various reasons. We operate in a competitive market in which vendor distribution and sales agreements are subject to turnover due to competitive bidding processes and other factors. Adjusted gross billings for the Lifeboat Distribution segment increased $6.3 million or 7% to $102.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. Adjusted gross billings increased at a lower rate than net sales due to a decline in gross profit as a percentage of adjusted gross billings for certain products that are reported net of the related cost of sales.  
 TechXtend segment net sales increased $2.0 million or 52% to $5.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared to $3.7 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to several larger enterprise sales during the current period compared to the second quarter of 2017. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers and internal capital allocation decisions regarding capital we allocate to the extended payment program. Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $7.3 million or 100% to $14.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018.   
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 34.5% of our net sales. One major customer accounted for 18.4% and the other for 16.1%, of our total net sales during the three months ended June 30, 2018. These same customers accounted for 32.3% and 8.4%, of total net accounts receivable as of June 30, 2018.  
 Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 decreased slightly to $6.5 million, compared to $6.6 million for the same period in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit decreased 6% or $0.3 million to $5.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 compared $5.6 million for the same period in 2017 due to lower vendor rebates and the impact of our lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales (discussed below). Vendor rebates decreased due to the termination of one of our distribution agreements by a vendor that paid a rebate based on sales. TechXtend segment gross profit increased 27% to $1.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 compared to $1.0 million for the same period in the prior year due to the increased net sales from the large enterprise sales discussed above.   
 Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was 14.8% compared to 16.8% in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 13.8% for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared to 15.9% in 2017. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was 21.9%, compared to 26.1% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily caused by the change in the percentage mix of our products which are recorded net of the related cost of sales. During the three months ended June 30, 2018 approximately 8.7 percent of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 10.5% in 2017. This shift in product mix had the effect of reducing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 170 basis points. The remainder of the decline was caused by lower gross profit margin on Software and hardware products recorded on a gross basis, as growth in these products was primarily from high volume lines which are sold at lower gross profit margin than our average gross profit. We operate in a competitive environment where the trend has been and may continue to be for gross profit margins as a percentage of adjusted gross billings to decline.   
 Separation expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was $2.4 million compared to no expense in the same period in 2017. The increase is due to $2.4 million in separation expenses related to the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 11, 2018, consisting of a $1.7 million charge for accelerated vesting of restricted stock and $0.8 million in accrued payments to be made over the next twelve months.   
 For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.1 million, compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2017. The company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was impacted by limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation resulting from section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and adjustments to the accrual for state income taxes in states which have enacted economic nexus statutes. The Company recorded a $0.4 million tax benefit related to separation expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2018 which were accounted for as a discrete item, resulting in a 18% effective tax benefit rate on that expense. We also adjusted our provision for state income taxes in states with economic nexus statutes by $0.2. The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.1% for the three months ending June 30, 2018, compared to 32.0% during the same period in the prior year.   
 Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased 10%, or $7.4 million, to $84.5 million, compared to $77.1 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted gross billings for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased 12%, 
or $25.9 million, to $241.7 million, compared to $215.8 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted gross billings increased at a higher rate than net sales primarily due to a higher percentage of sales being comprised of maintenance and Software-security and highly interdependent with support which are recorded on a net basis.   
 Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $6.0 million, or 9% to $75.2 million, compared to $69.2 million for the same period a year earlier. The increase was due primarily to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines, as well as the addition of several new product lines. The increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and customer accounts. We operate in a competitive market in which vendor distribution and sales agreements are subject to change due competitive bidding processes and other factors. Adjusted gross billings for the Lifeboat Distribution segment increased $20.9 million or 10% to $221.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.  
 TechXtend segment net sales increased $1.4 million or 17% to $9.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $7.9 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to several high dollar enterprise sale transactions during the period ended June 30, 2018. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from period to period based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers and internal capital allocation decisions regarding funds allocated to our extended payment program. Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $5.0 million or 32% to $20.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Adjusted gross billings increased at a higher rate than net sales because of a higher percentage of our sales being derived from maintenance, service and subscriptions which are recorded on a net basis.  
 During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 43.2% of our gross billings. One major customer accounted for 22.0% and the other for 17.1%, of our total net sales during the six months ended June 30, 2018. These same customers accounted for 32.3% and 8.4%, of total net accounts receivable as of June 30, 2018.  
 Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased 1% or $0.1 million, to $13.4 million, compared to $13.3 million for the same period in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit was unchanged at $11.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as the impact of decreased gross profit margins offset increases in net sales. TechXtend segment gross profit increased 3% or $0.1 million to $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to the higher sales discussed above.  
 Separation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $2.4 million compared to no expense in the same period in 2017. The increase is due to $2.4 million in separation expenses related to the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 11, 2018, consisting of a $1.7 million charge for accelerated vesting of restricted stock and $0.8 million in accrued payments to be made over the next twelve months.  
 For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the we recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.6 million or 55.0% of income, compared to $1.2 million or 32.0% of income for the same period in 2017. The company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was impacted by limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation resulting from section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and adjustments to the accrual for state income taxes in states which have enacted economic nexus statutes. We recorded a $0.4 million tax benefit related to separation expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2018 which were accounted for as a discrete item, resulting in a 18% effective tax benefit rate on those expenses. We also recorded an adjustment to our accrual for state income taxes in states with economic nexus statutes of $0.2 million. The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.1% for the six months ending June 30, 2018.  
 Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $4.9 million to $10.4 million at June 30, 2018 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in cash was primarily the result of $7.8 million in cash provided by operating activities offset by $2.5 million of cash used for stock repurchases and dividends.   
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $7.8 million, comprised of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $3.2 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.6 million.   
 The increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in net working capital (accounts receivable, inventory, and vendor prepayments less accounts payable) resulting from the utilization of vendor prepayments made in the prior year and reduced long term accounts receivable.  
 We anticipate that our working capital needs will increase as we invest in the growth of our business. We believe that the funds held in cash and cash equivalents and our unused borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  
 As of June 30, 2018, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under our lines of credit and no commitments relating to standby letters of credit, and has no standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments (see Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements).  
 As of June 30, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
