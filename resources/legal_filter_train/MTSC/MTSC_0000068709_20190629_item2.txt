As of September 29, 2018, we had 3,400 employees and revenue of $778,032 for fiscal year 2018.
On November 21, 2018, we acquired E2M Technologies B.V. (E2M) for a cash purchase price of $80,287.
We funded the acquisition of E2M through borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility.
On November 21, 2018, we amended the Credit Agreement to increase the size of our Revolving Credit Facility from $120,000 to $150,000 and to extend the expiration date to July 5, 2022.
The size of the Revolving Credit Facility was increased to finance the purchase of E2M.
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the amendment to the Credit Agreement.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, certain holders of our TEUs elected to early convert the equity component on 394 of our outstanding TEUs at the minimum conversion rate of 1.9841 which resulted in the issuance of 781 shares of our common stock.
Approximately 70% of our revenue has historically been derived from customers outside of the U.S. Our financial results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan.
The discussion below quantifies the impact of foreign currency translation on our financial results for the periods discussed.
In fiscal year 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), followed by related amendments (collectively, "the new revenue standard" or "ASC 606").
See Note 2 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Income Statements and Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The terms "MTS," "we," "us," "the Company" or "our" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to MTS Systems Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
The following tables compare results of operations, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation, the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
2 The Acquisition column includes revenues and costs from the acquisition of E2M and costs incurred as part of the acquisition of E2M.
See Notes 3, 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the new revenue standard, restructuring and related costs, and the E2M acquisition, respectively.
Selling and marketing expense for the three months ended June 29, 2019 increased 3.6% primarily due to increased compensation expense to support sales growth, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation.
Selling and marketing expense for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 4.2% primarily due to increased compensation and commissions expense to support sales growth and the addition of E2M expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation.
Income from operations for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 41.4% and 31.9%, respectively, primarily due to increased gross profit on higher revenue volume and the impact of the E2M acquisition, partially offset by higher compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses.
Interest expense, net for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased primarily due to an increase in interest expense on the revolving credit facility drawn on in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 to fund the acquisition of E2M, which was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to lower balances on the tranche B term loan, as well as current year favorable effects of our interest rate swap.
The decrease in other income (expense), net for the three months ended June 29, 2019 was primarily driven by a relative increase in losses on foreign currency transactions, partially offset by an increase in rental income.
The increase in other income (expense), net for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in rental income, partially offset by a relative increase in losses on foreign currency transactions.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 29, 2019 increased primarily due to higher earnings before tax and the reversal of a $1,297 discrete tax benefit originally recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) as a result of regulatory updates issued during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased primarily due to certain discrete benefits of $25,378 in the prior year for the estimated impact of the Tax Act.
Excluding the impact of these discrete benefits, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 would have been 15.2%.
The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the implementation of the lower 21% U.S. statutory rate for fiscal year 2019 as compared to the blended statutory rate of 24.5% effective in fiscal year 2018.
2 The Acquisition column includes revenues and costs from the acquisition of E2M and costs incurred as part of the acquisition of E2M.

Revenue for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 27.8% and 23.3%, respectively, primarily driven by volume growth across all sectors from conversion of robust beginning-of-year backlog and the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Excluding the impact of currency translation and the E2M acquisition, revenue increased 23.7% and 19.4%, respectively.
Gross profit for the three months ended June 29, 2019 increased 21.0% primarily due to higher revenue volume and the gross profit contribution from the E2M acquisition, partially offset by increased compensation expense.

Selling and marketing expense for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 6.1% primarily due to higher commissions and compensation expense, as well as the addition of E2M expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation.
General and administrative expense for the three months ended June 29, 2019 declined 0.8% primarily driven by lower compensation expense, partially offset by the addition of E2M expenses.
General and administrative expense for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 9.0% primarily driven by the addition of E2M expenses and acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by lower compensation expense.
Income from operations for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 146.1% primarily due to increased gross profit on higher revenue volume, partially offset by higher compensation and commissions expense.

See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our reportable segments.
Revenue for the three months ended June 29, 2019 increased 6.6% primarily driven by growth in both the Sensors test sector from a multi-year contract with the U.S. Department of Defense and the Sensors industrial sector from strength in the energy market, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue increased 8.9%.
Revenue for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 3.4% primarily driven by growth in the Sensors test sector from a multi-year contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, growth in the Sensors position sector in the first half of the fiscal year and growth in the Sensors industrial sector from strength in the energy market, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue increased 5.6%.

Excluding the impact of currency translation, income from operations decreased 4.0% and 5.1%, respectively.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash used by working capital associated with timing fluctuations from accounts receivable payments received and unbilled accounts receivable accruals, accounts payable payments, advanced payments received from customers, and inventory purchases, as well as a decrease in net income due to the remeasurement of our estimated deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act in fiscal year 2018.
This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in cash used by deferred income taxes due to the Tax Act in fiscal year 2018, an increase in cash provided by other assets and liabilities related to accrued project costs, and a decrease in cash used by payroll-related accruals.
The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as well as an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment for continued strategic investments in the business.
The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility used to fund the acquisition of E2M and a decrease in cash used for long-term debt payments due to required annual Excess Cash Flow payments made in fiscal year 2018.
We had cash and cash equivalents of $75,735 as of June 29, 2019.
Of this amount, $21,623 was located in North America, $28,601 in Europe and $25,511 in Asia.
In accordance with our investment policy, we place cash equivalent investments with issuers who have high-quality investment credit ratings.
Our investment objectives are to preserve principal, maintain liquidity and achieve the best available return consistent with our primary objectives of safety and liquidity.
As of June 29, 2019, we held no short-term investments.
As of June 29, 2019, our capital structure was comprised of $31,634 in short-term debt, $440,767 in long-term debt and $494,539 in shareholders' equity.
Total interest-bearing debt as of June 29, 2019 was $472,401.
The Credit Agreement also requires mandatory prepayments on our Term Facility in certain circumstances, including the potential for an annual required prepayment of a certain percentage of our excess cash flow.
Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to incur debt, create liens, dispose of assets, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into any restrictive agreements and customary events of default (including payment defaults, covenant defaults, change of control defaults and bankruptcy defaults).
The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, including the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), as defined in the Credit Agreement, as well as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense.
These covenants restrict our ability to pay dividends and purchase outstanding shares of common stock.
As of June 29, 2019, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our financing arrangements.
Shareholders' equity increased by $16,607 during the nine months ended June 29, 2019 primarily due to $38,246 net income and $7,515 stock-based compensation.
The increase was partially offset by $16,355 dividends declared and $6,885 other comprehensive loss.
Also contributing to the decrease was a cumulative effect of accounting change reduction to our opening retained earnings balance of $6,227 related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, ASU No.
As of June 29, 2019, we believe our current capital resources will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and operations for the foreseeable future, including at least the next twelve months.
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for changes to our capital structure incurred subsequent to the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.
For further information, see "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" under Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018.
The following critical accounting policy has been updated since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018.
Revenue is recognized either over time as work progresses or at a point-in-time, dependent upon contract-specific terms and the pattern of transfer of control of the product or service to the customer.
Contracts with equipment revenue recognized over time use costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying the performance obligation.
Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer.
Equipment contract costs include materials, component parts, labor and overhead costs.
recognized over time, we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.
These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, and internal and subcontractor performance.
We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method.
Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance is recognized using the adjusted estimate.
If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified.
Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Our dividend policy is to maintain a payout ratio that allows dividends to increase in conjunction with the long-term growth of earnings per share, while sustaining dividends through economic cycles.
Our dividend practice is to target, over time, a payout ratio of approximately 25% of net earnings per share.
Forward-looking statements are qualified by some or all of these risk factors.
Our Board of Directors approved, and on February 11, 2011 announced, a purchase authorization of 2,000 shares.
The share purchase authorization has no expiration date.
We made no share purchases during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.
As of June 29, 2019, there were 438 shares available for purchase under the existing authorization.
In connection with the pricing of the tangible equity units (TEUs) sold in our public offering in fiscal year 2016, we purchased capped calls from third party banking institutions (Capped Calls) for $7,935.
On June 13, 2018, we amended the agreements with third party banking institutions for the outstanding Capped Calls (Capped Call Agreements) to modify the timing of settlement to be only upon expiration for all outstanding Capped Calls.
As of June 29, 2019 the range of shares of our common stock to be received for the outstanding Capped Calls was a minimum of 0 shares to a maximum of 268 shares, subject to market conditions.
See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our equity instruments.
