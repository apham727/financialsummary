In addition, certain statements in our future filings with the SEC, in press releases, and in oral and written statements made by us or with our approval that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act.
Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) projections of revenue, ROIC, EBITDA, income or loss, earnings or loss per share, the payment or nonpayment of dividends, capital structure, the adequacy of our liquidity and reserves, the anticipated level of expenditures required and other statements concerning future financial performance; (ii) statements of our plans and objectives by our management or Board of Directors, including those relating to products or services, merger or acquisition activity and the potential impact of newly acquired businesses; (iii) statements of assumptions underlying such statements; (iv) statements regarding business relationships with vendors, customers or collaborators or statements relating to our order cancellation history, our ability to convert our backlog of undelivered orders into revenue, the timing of purchases, competitive advantages and growth in end markets; (v) statements regarding our ability to report additional operating segments, to raise capital in a timely manner or to compete acquisitions in the future; (vi) statements regarding products, their characteristics, fluctuations in the costs of raw materials for products, our geographic footprint, performance, sales potential or effect in the hands of customers; and (vii) statements regarding the estimated tax benefits we receive under the Tax Act and our expectations concerning recorded adjustments.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and in Item 1A of Part II of this Current Report on Form 10-Q.
The performance of our business and our securities may be adversely affected by these factors and by other factors common to other businesses and investments, or to the general economy.
Therefore, you should consider these forward-looking statements with caution and form your own critical and independent conclusions about the likely effect of these risk factors on our future performance.
Readers should carefully review the disclosures and the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and other documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
