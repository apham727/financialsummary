Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), as of December 29, 2018.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 29, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes were made to our internal controls over financial reporting, effective beginning on September 30, 2018, related to the implementation of the new revenue standard.
See Note 2 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on the new revenue standard.
