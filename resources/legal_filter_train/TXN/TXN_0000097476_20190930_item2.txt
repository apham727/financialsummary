•A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology.
To strengthen this advantage, we are planning our next phase of 300-millimeter capacity expansion as 300-millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our Analog growth.
•Broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors.
Our customers need multiple chips for their systems.
•Broadest reach of market channels.
Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors’ websites.
•Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions.
Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders.
Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments.
Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities.
This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term.
The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow.
Our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash and return that cash to shareholders.
See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.
Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand.
•All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.
Our third quarter revenue was $3.77 billion, net income was $1.43 billion and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.49.
Revenue decreased 11% from the same quarter a year ago, as most markets weakened further.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 8% and Embedded Processing declined 19% from the same quarter a year ago.
Our cash flow from operations of $7.0 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $6.0 billion and 41% of revenue.
This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production.
We have returned $7.4 billion to shareholders in the past 12 months through stock repurchases and dividends.
Over the last 12 months, our dividends represented 48% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 17%.
Together, our stock repurchases and dividends reflect our continued commitment to return all free cash flow to our shareholders.
For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section.
Revenue of $3.77 billion decreased $490 million, or 11%, primarily due to lower revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing.
Gross profit of $2.45 billion was down $358 million, or 13%, due to lower revenue.
As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 64.9% from 65.8%.
Acquisition charges of $79 million were non-cash.

Operating profit was $1.59 billion, or 42.1% of revenue, compared with $1.94 billion, or 45.5% of revenue.
Interest and debt expense of $43 million increased $7 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.
The decrease was due to higher discrete tax benefits, lower income before income taxes and, to a lesser extent, a lower annual operating tax rate.
We use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate.
Net income was $1.43 billion compared with $1.57 billion.
EPS was $1.49 compared with $1.58.
Analog revenue decreased due to Power, Signal Chain and, to a lesser extent, High Volume.
Embedded Processing revenue decreased in both product lines about equally.
Other revenue decreased $87 million, and operating profit decreased $56 million.
Revenue of $11.03 billion decreased $1.03 billion, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue from Embedded Processing and Analog.

EPS was $4.12 compared with $4.32.
Embedded Processing revenue decreased in Processors and Connected Microcontrollers.

Days sales outstanding at the end of the third quarter of 2019 were 32 compared with 29 at the end of 2018.

Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable-rate, revolving credit facility.
Cash flows from operating activities for the first nine months of 2019 were $4.90 billion, a decrease of $149 million primarily due to lower net income.
Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2024.
This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper.
As of September 30, 2019, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding.
Investing activities for the first nine months of 2019 provided $1 million compared with $1.58 billion of cash used in the year-ago period.

Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $491 million compared with $335 million in the year-ago period.

We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.
