A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology.
To strengthen this advantage, we are planning our next phase of 300-millimeter capacity expansion as 300-millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our Analog growth.
Broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors.
Our customers need multiple chips for their systems.
Broadest reach of market channels.
Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors’ websites.
Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions.
Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders.
Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments.
Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities.
Analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation.
This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders.
The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow.
Our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash and return that cash to shareholders.
See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.
Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand.
All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.
Our first-quarter revenue was $3.59 billion, net income was $1.22 billion and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.26.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 2% and Embedded Processing declined 14% from the same quarter a year ago.
Our cash flow from operations of $7.2 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $6.0 billion and represents 38.4% of revenue.
This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production.
We have returned $8.0 billion to owners in the past 12 months through stock repurchases and dividends.
Our strategy is to return all our free cash flow to shareholders.
Over the last 12 months, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% in 2019.
For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section.
Revenue of $3.59 billion decreased $195 million, or 5%, due to lower revenue from Embedded Processing and Analog.
Gross profit of $2.26 billion was down $186 million, or 8%, due to lower revenue and reduced factory loadings.
Acquisition charges of $79 million were non-cash.
See Note 5 to the financial statements.
Operating profit was $1.38 billion, or 38.4% of revenue, compared with $1.55 billion, or 40.9% of revenue.
Interest and debt expense of $38 million increased $15 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.
The decrease was due to lower income before income taxes.
Our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, is about 16% compared with 20% in 2018.
We use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate.
Signal Chain revenue increased due to the mix of products shipped.
Operating profit decreased due to lower revenue and reduced factory loadings.
Embedded Processing revenue decreased in both product lines, led by Processors.
Operating profit decreased due to lower revenue and associated gross profit.
Other revenue decreased by $17 million, and operating profit decreased by $12 million.
Inventory was $2.13 billion, a decrease of $86 million from the end of 2018.
Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations.
Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable-rate, revolving credit facility.
Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2024.
This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper.
As of March 31, 2019, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding.
Investing activities for the first three months of 2019 provided $1.17 billion compared with $266 million in the year-ago period.
Capital expenditures were $251 million compared with $189 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods.
We had sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash proceeds of $1.44 billion compared with $459 million in the year-ago period.
In 2019, we received net proceeds of $743 million from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt.
Dividends paid were $724 million compared with $611 million in the year-ago period, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.
We used $1.15 billion to repurchase 11.7 million shares of our common stock compared with $873 million used in the year-ago period to repurchase 8.2 million shares.
We had $3.72 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $366 million of short-term investments as of March 31, 2019.
We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.
