A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology.
300-millimeter wafers will support the majority of our Analog growth going forward.
Broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors.
Our customers need multiple chips for their systems.
Broadest reach of market channels.
Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors.
Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions.
Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders.
Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments.
Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities.
Analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity, and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation.
This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders.
The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow.
Our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash, and return that cash to shareholders.
See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.
All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.
Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand.
Our third-quarter revenue was $4.26 billion, net income was $1.57 billion and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.58.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 8 percent and Embedded Processing declined 4 percent from the same quarter a year ago.
Our cash flow from operations of $7.0 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model.
This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production.
Over the last 12 months, our dividends represented 41 percent of free cash flow, emphasizing their sustainability.
We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20 percent in 2018 and about 16 percent starting in 2019.
For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section.
Revenue of $4.26 billion increased $145 million, or 4 percent, due to higher revenue from Analog, partially offset by lower revenue from Embedded Processing.

Days sales outstanding at the end of the third quarter of 2018 were 33 compared with 31 at the end of 2017.

Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations.
Additional sources of liquidity are Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and a variable-rate, revolving credit facility.
Cash flows from operating activities for the first nine months of 2018 were $5.04 billion, an increase of $1.61 billion from the year-ago period.
This increase was due to higher Net income and a reduction in cash used for working capital, both of which benefited from a lower tax rate.
Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2023.
This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper.
As of September 30, 2018, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding.
Capital expenditures were $808 million compared with $464 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods.
We had purchases of short-term investments, net of sales, that used cash of $763 million compared with proceeds from sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash of $200 million in the year-ago period.

In the year-ago period, we received net proceeds of $605 million from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $625 million.
Dividends paid were $1.82 billion compared with $1.49 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.
We used $3.09 billion to repurchase 28.6 million shares of our common stock compared with $1.85 billion used in the year-ago period to repurchase 23.2 million shares.
We had $1.50 billion of Cash and cash equivalents and $3.61 billion of Short-term investments as of September 30, 2018.
We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.
We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance.
