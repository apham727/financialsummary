A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology.
To strengthen this advantage, we are planning our next phase of 300-millimeter capacity expansion as 300-millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our Analog growth.
Broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors.
Our customers need multiple chips for their systems.
Broadest reach of market channels.
Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors’ websites.
Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions.
Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders.
Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments.
Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities.
This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders.
The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow.
Our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash and return that cash to shareholders.
See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.
Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand.
All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.
Our second quarter revenue was $3.67 billion, net income was $1.31 billion and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.36.
Revenue decreased 9% from the same quarter a year ago due to broad-based weakness.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 6% and Embedded Processing declined 16% from the same quarter a year ago.
Our cash flow from operations of $7.2 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $5.9 billion and 39% of revenue.
This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production.
We have returned $8.0 billion to shareholders in the past 12 months through stock repurchases and dividends.
Our strategy is to return all our free cash flow to shareholders.
Over the last 12 months, our dividends represented 47% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section.
Revenue of $3.67 billion decreased $349 million, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing.
Gross profit of $2.36 billion was down $259 million, or 10%, due to lower revenue.
Acquisition charges of $80 million were non-cash.
See Note 5 to the financial statements.
Operating profit was $1.51 billion, or 41.1% of revenue, compared with $1.71 billion, or 42.6% of revenue.

We use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate.
Net income was $1.31 billion compared with $1.41 billion.
Analog revenue decreased due to High Volume, Power and, to a lesser extent, Signal Chain.
Embedded Processing revenue decreased in Processors and Connected Microcontrollers.
Other revenue decreased by $40 million.
Operating profit increased by $18 million.
Revenue of $7.26 billion decreased $544 million, or 7%, due to lower revenue from Embedded Processing and, to a lesser extent, Analog.
Gross profit of $4.62 billion was down $445 million, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue.
Operating expenses were $1.61 billion compared with $1.64 billion.

The decrease was due to a lower annual operating tax rate and lower income before income taxes, partially offset by a reduction of discrete tax benefits.
Net income was $2.52 billion compared with $2.77 billion.
Embedded Processing revenue decreased in Processors and Connected Microcontrollers.
Other revenue decreased by $57 million.

Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2024.
This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper.

Investing activities for the first six months of 2019 provided $915 million compared with $185 million in the year-ago period.

Dividends paid were $1.45 billion compared with $1.22 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.
