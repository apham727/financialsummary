Broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors. Our customers need multiple chips for their systems. The breadth of our portfolio means we can meet more of these needs than our competitors can, which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to sell more products and generate more revenue per customer system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio, which includes tens of thousands of products. 
Broadest reach of market channels. Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors’ websites. Our web presence, combined with our global sales force that is also greater in size than those of our competitors, are advantages that give us unique access to about 100,000 customers designing TI semiconductors into their end products. 
Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation. This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. 
The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow. Our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash and return that cash to shareholders. 
All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars. 
Our second quarter revenue was $3.67 billion, net income was $1.31 billion and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.36. 
Revenue decreased 9% from the same quarter a year ago due to broad-based weakness. 
In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 6% and Embedded Processing declined 16% from the same quarter a year ago. 
Our cash flow from operations of $7.2 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $5.9 billion and 39% of revenue. This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. 
We have returned $8.0 billion to shareholders in the past 12 months through stock repurchases and dividends. Our strategy is to return all our free cash flow to shareholders. Over the last 12 months, our dividends represented 47% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. 
For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section. 
Revenue of $3.67 billion decreased $349 million, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing. 
Gross profit of $2.36 billion was down $259 million, or 10%, due to lower revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 64.3% from 65.2%. 
Acquisition charges of $80 million were non-cash. See Note 5 to the financial statements. 
Operating profit was $1.51 billion, or 41.1% of revenue, compared with $1.71 billion, or 42.6% of revenue. 
Interest and debt expense of $44 million increased $14 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt. 
Other revenue decreased by $40 million. Operating profit increased by $18 million. 
Revenue of $7.26 billion decreased $544 million, or 7%, due to lower revenue from Embedded Processing and, to a lesser extent, Analog. 
Gross profit of $4.62 billion was down $445 million, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 63.6% from 64.9%. 
Operating expenses were $1.61 billion compared with $1.64 billion. 
Acquisition charges of $159 million were non-cash. See Note 5 to the financial statements. 
Operating profit was $2.89 billion, or 39.7% of revenue, compared with $3.26 billion, or 41.8% of revenue. 
Interest and debt expense of $82 million increased $29 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt. 
Other revenue decreased by $57 million. Operating profit increased by $6 million. 
Accounts receivable were $1.42 billion, an increase of $212 million compared with the end of 2018. Days sales outstanding at the end of the second quarter of 2019 were 35 compared with 29 at the end of 2018. 
Inventory was $2.08 billion, a decrease of $138 million from the end of 2018. Days of inventory at the end of the second quarter of 2019 were 143 compared with 152 at the end of 2018. 
Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable-rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for the first six months of 2019 were $2.90 billion, a decrease of $35 million. 
Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2024. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of June 30, 2019, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. 
Investing activities for the first six months of 2019 provided $915 million compared with $185 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures were $535 million compared with $438 million in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. We had sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash proceeds of $1.40 billion compared with $621 million in the year-ago period. 
Financing activities for the first six months of 2019 used $2.44 billion compared with $1.86 billion in the year-ago period. In 2019, we received net proceeds of $743 million from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt. In the year-ago period, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt, and we retired maturing debt of $500 million. Dividends paid were $1.45 billion compared with $1.22 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. We used $2.02 billion to repurchase 19.6 million shares of our common stock compared with $1.89 billion used in the year-ago period to repurchase 17.8 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $297 million compared with $280 million in the year-ago period. 
We had $3.81 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $405 million of short-term investments as of June 30, 2019. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures.
