The Company has reclassified the presentation of certain prior-year information to conform to the current presentation.
The Company included finance lease receivables of $13.3 and $14.4 in other assets as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.

Third-party freight payments are recorded in cost of sales.
The Company includes a warranty in connection with certain contracts with customers, which are not considered to be separate performance obligations.
The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs.
For additional information on product warranty refer to note 9.
The Company also has extended warranty and service contracts available for its customers, which are recognized as separate performance obligations.

The typical contract length for service is generally one year and is billed and paid in advance except for installations, among others.
For bundled packages, the Company accounts for individual services separately if they are distinct.
The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices.
The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the services.
Revenue on service contracts is recognized ratably over time, generally using an input measure, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance as the services are performed.
In some circumstances, when global service supply chain services are not included in a term contract and rather billed as they occur, revenue on these billed work services are recognized at a point in time as transfer of control occurs.

In the case of more significant professional services agreements, when the Company’s performance creates an asset with no alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue is also recognized over time.
Generally revenue will be recognized using an input measure, typically cost incurred, in the more significant professional services agreements.
The systems portfolio for banking customers consists of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation tools and physical security devices.
For retail customers, the checkout portfolio includes modular, integrated and mobile POS systems that meet evolving automation and omnichannel requirements of consumers.

The Company’s hybrid product line can alternate from an attended operator to self-checkout with the press of a button as traffic conditions warrant throughout the business day.
For bundled packages, the Company accounts for individual system products separately if they are distinct - i.e.
if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.
The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between distinct obligations in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices.
The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the products.
Revenue on systems is recognized at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the system, which could be upon delivery or upon completion of installation services, depending on contract terms.

The Company applied the practical expedient related to assessment of contract modifications, whereby the Company is essentially allowed to use hindsight when assessing the effect of a modification and accounting for the modified contract as if it existed from the beginning of the original contract.
As professional services can be highly customized for each customer, there is no alternative use for the services.
When there is an enforceable right to payment for service completed combined with no alternative use of the services, the services meet criteria for over time revenue recognition.
Revenue is recognized as the services are provided and as the customer benefits from the service.
Revenue is recognized progressively based on the costs incurred method.
When the professional services are not highly customized as in basic software installation services, customers do not take control of the services until they are completed.
Therefore, the Company continues to recognize revenue for such contracts when the services are completed and customers formally accept them.
