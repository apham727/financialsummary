The Company operates in Argentina through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Diebold Argentina, S.A.
The Argentina operations represent less than one percent of the Company's total assets and total net sales as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
On August 15, 2016, the Company designated its €350.0 euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a net investment hedge of its investments in certain subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency in order to reduce volatility in stockholders' equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro with respect to the U.S. dollar.
Effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly by confirming that the respective designated net investments' net equity balances at the beginning of any period collectively continues to equal or exceed the balance outstanding on the Company's euro-denominated term loan.
Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI.
When the respective net investments are sold or substantially liquidated, the balance of the cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings.
