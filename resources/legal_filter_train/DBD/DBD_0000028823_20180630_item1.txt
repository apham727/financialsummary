The Company has reclassified the presentation of certain prior-year information to conform to the current presentation.
The Company included finance lease receivables of $12.8 and $14.4 in other assets as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.
The Company's payment terms vary depending on the individual contracts and are generally fixed fee.
In certain contracts where services are provided prior to billing, the Company recognizes a contract asset within trade receivables and other current assets.
Third-party freight payments are recorded in cost of sales.
The Company includes a warranty in connection with certain contracts with customers, which are not considered to be separate performance obligations.
The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs.
For additional information on product warranty refer to note 9.
The Company also has extended warranty and service contracts available for its customers, which are recognized as separate performance obligations.
Revenue is recognized on these contracts ratably as the Company has a stand-ready obligation to provide services when or as needed by the customer.
The following is a description of principal solutions offered within the Company's two main industry segments that generate the Company's revenue.
For more detailed information about reportable operating segments, see note 20.
The Company provides its banking customers product-related services which include proactive monitoring and rapid resolution of incidents through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit.

Managed services and outsourcing consists of the end-to-end business processes, solution management, upgrades and transaction processing.
The Company also provides a full array of cash management services, which optimizes the availability and cost of physical currency across the enterprise through efficient forecasting, inventory and replenishment processes.
The typical contract length for service is generally one year and is billed and paid in advance except for installations, among others.
The Company's hardware-agnostic software applications facilitate millions of transactions via automated teller machines (ATMs), point of sale (POS) terminals, kiosks, and other self-service devices.
The Company provides its banking customers front-end applications for consumer connection points and back-end platforms that manage channel transactions, operations and integration.
For retail customers, the Company provides a comprehensive, modular solution capable of enabling the most advanced omnichannel retail use cases.
The Company's platform software is installed within bank and retail data centers to facilitate omnichannel transactions, endpoint monitoring, remote asset management, customer marketing, merchandise management and analytics.
The Company’s software solution includes its professional services team, who provides systems integration, customization, consulting and project management.
The Company’s advisory services team collaborates with its customers to help define optimal user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to meet branch and store automation objectives.
Software licenses and professional services may be sold separately or in bundled packages.
The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between distinct obligations in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices.
Revenue from professional services are recognized over time, because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance as the services are performed or when the Company’s performance creates an asset with no alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
Generally revenue will be recognized using an input measure, typically costs incurred.
Products for banking customers consists of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation tools and kiosk technologies, as well as physical security solutions.
The retail product portfolio includes modular, integrated and mobile POS and self-checkout (SCO) terminals that meet evolving automation and omnichannel requirements of consumers.

Also in the portfolio, the Company provides self-checkout terminals and ordering kiosks which facilitate an efficient and user-friendly purchasing experience.
The Company’s hybrid product line can alternate from an attended operator to self-checkout with the press of a button as traffic conditions warrant throughout the business day.
For bundled packages, the Company accounts for individual services separately if they are distinct.
The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate services or distinct obligations in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices.
The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the products or services.
Revenue on service contracts is recognized ratably over time, generally using an input measure, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance as the services are performed.
Product revenue is recognized at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which could be upon delivery or upon completion of installation services, depending on contract terms.
Contract assets are minimal for the periods presented.
The amount of revenue recognized in 2018 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to the changes in the estimate of variable consideration and contract modifications was de minimis.
There have been $2.1 and $5.0 during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $10.9 and $14.8 during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of impairment losses recognized as bad debt related to receivables or contract assets arising from the Company's contracts with customers.
As of January 1, 2018, the Company had $437.5 of unrecognized deferred revenue constituting the remaining performance obligations that are either unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied).
In 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $179.7 related to the Company's deferred revenue balance at January 1, 2018.
Contract assets of the Company primarily relate to the Company's rights to consideration for goods shipped and services provided but not contractually billable at the reporting date.
The contract assets are reclassified into the receivables balance when the rights to receive payment become unconditional.
Contract liabilities are recorded for any services billed to customers and not yet recognizable if the contract period has commenced or for the amount collected from customers in advance of the contract period commencing.
The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
The Company also applies the ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-55-18 related to performance obligations satisfied over time, which permits the Company to recognize revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date.
As of June 30, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $2,600.
The Company expects to recognize revenue on the remaining performance obligations over the next twelve months.
The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.
The Company also applies the ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-55-18 related to performance obligations satisfied over time which permits the Company to recognize revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date.
The Company has minimal cost to obtain or fulfill contracts for customers for the periods presented.
Except for the changes below, the Company has consistently applied the accounting policies to all periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements.
The Company adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with a date of initial application of January 1, 2018.
As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below.
Therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under Topic 605.
The Company applied the practical expedient related to assessment of contract modifications, whereby the Company is essentially allowed to use hindsight when assessing the effect of a modification and accounting for the modified contract as if it existed from the beginning of the original contract.
As professional services can be highly customized for each customer, there is no alternative use for the services.
When there is an enforceable right to payment for service completed combined with no alternative use of the services, the services meet criteria for over time revenue recognition.
Revenue is recognized as the services are provided and as the customer benefits from the service.
Revenue is recognized progressively based on the costs incurred method.
When the professional services are not highly customized as in basic software installation services, customers do not take control of the services until they are completed.
Therefore, the Company continues to recognize revenue for such contracts when the services are completed and customers formally accept them.
The impact to net sales and cost of sales would have been decreases of $14.7 and $8.2, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and $13.8 and $8.6, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The impact after tax was $(4.6) and $(3.6) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and was primarily a result of timing of deferred revenue related to products and software for certain amounts being recognized that would have previously been deferred, and certain amounts being deferred that would have previously been recognized.
