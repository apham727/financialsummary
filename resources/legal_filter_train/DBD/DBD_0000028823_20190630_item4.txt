This quarterly report on Form 10-Q includes the certifications of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) required by Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act).
This Item 4 includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in those certifications.
Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Company's management, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
•The Company had ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) related to IT systems used for financial reporting by certain entities throughout the organization.
The Company did not establish effective IT and financial user access controls commensurate with certain job responsibilities.
Consequently, automated and manual process level controls over financial reporting which were dependent upon these ITGCs were also ineffective.
•The Company had ineffective implementation and operation of controls over inventory valuation related to spare parts and finished goods from canceled orders as the Company did not effectively communicate information to certain locations to allow for the effective operations or implementation of these controls.
•The Company had ineffective controls over non-routine transactions as certain controls were not designed at the appropriate level of precision to ensure calculations supporting non-routine transactions were calculated correctly.
Because of the material weaknesses identified above, a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
•Implementing controls over calculations associated with non-routine transactions at a more precise level of operation.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
