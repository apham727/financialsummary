Lam Research is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.
We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines.
Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive devices, storage devices, and networking equipment.
Our vision is to realize full value from natural technology extensions of our company.
Our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as non-volatile memory (“NVM”), DRAM memory, and logic devices.
We aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success.
Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.
This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps.
Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale.
Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.
At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional two-dimensional scaling.
These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical scaling strategies like 3D architectures as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks.
We believe that demand for our products and services should increase faster than overall spending on wafer fabrication equipment, as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas, and we continue to gain market share.
We acquired the outstanding shares of Coventor, Inc., a privately-held company, on August 28, 2017, as further discussed in Note 15 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The results of the acquired business are included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the March 2018 quarter, revenue increased compared to the December 2017 quarter primarily as a result of increased investments from our memory customers.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the March 2018 quarter decreased as compared to the December 2017 quarter primarily due to customer and product mix.
Operating expenses in the March 2018 quarter increased compared to the December 2017 quarter mainly due to an increase in employee compensation and supplies.
The December 2017 quarter results were negatively impacted by a one-time provisional charge associated with the U.S. tax reform legislation enacted during the quarter.
Our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances increased to $6.7 billion as of March 25, 2018, compared to $6.0 billion as of December 24, 2017.
Employee headcount as of March 25, 2018, was approximately 10,600.
Shipments for the March 2018 quarter increased 19% from the December 2017 quarter and increased 30% from the March 2017 quarter levels, reflecting timing of customer demand for semiconductor equipment.
The increase in the March 2018 quarter from the March 2017 quarter was mainly driven by investments from our memory customers.
Revenue for the March 2018 quarter increased 12% and 34% from the December 2017 and March 2017 quarters, respectively, and increased 40% in the nine months ended March 25, 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, reflecting stronger customer demand for semiconductor equipment.
Our deferred revenue balance at March 25, 2018 remained steady to the balance as of December 24, 2017, at $1.1 billion, as a result of timing of shipments and revenue recognition.
Our deferred revenue balance does not include system shipments to customers in Japan, for which title does not transfer until customer acceptance.
Shipments to customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.
The estimated future revenue value from shipments to customers in Japan was approximately $526 million as of March 25, 2018, and $289 million as of December 24, 2017.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased in the March 2018 quarter compared to the December 2017 quarter primarily due to changes in customer and product mix.
The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the March 2018 quarter compared to the March 2017 quarter as well as during the nine months ended March 25, 2018 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 is primarily due to favorable customer and product mix, offset by higher factory cost.
Interest income increased in the March 2018 quarter compared to the March 2017 quarter as a result of higher yield and balances.
Interest income increased in the nine months ended March 2018 compared to the nine months ended March 2017 as a result of an increase in yield and higher cash balances.
Interest expense decreased in the nine months ended March 2018 compared to the nine months ended March 2017 due to the termination of the Term Loan Agreement and mandatory redemption of the Senior Notes due 2023 and 2026 during the December 2016 quarter.
Foreign exchange fluctuations are primarily due to currency movements against portions of our unhedged balance sheet exposures.
The loss on impairment of investments in the three and nine months ended March 25, 2018 resulted from a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in conjunction with our cash repatriation strategy following the U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017.
Loss on extinguishment of debt in the nine months ended March 26, 2017 related to the special mandatory redemption of our 2023 and 2026 Notes, as well as, the termination of the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement following the Termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization with KLA–Tencor.
Other, net was lower during the March 2018 quarter, compared to the December 2017 quarter, primarily due to equity investment gains during the March 2018 quarter.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 25, 2018 compared to the three months ended December 24, 2017 was primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform mandated one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings in the three months ended December 24, 2017.
The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 25, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 26, 2017 was primarily due to recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits from lapse of statutes of limitation related to a prior business combination in the three months ended March 26, 2017.
The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 25, 2018 compared to the nine months ended March 26, 2017 was primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform mandated one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings in the nine months ended March 25, 2018.
Please refer to Note 6 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information.
This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach.
Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units.
Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.
For other long-lived assets, we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present.
If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value.
If the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values.
Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods.
The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value.
During the nine months ended March 25, 2018, approximately $574.2 million principle value of Convertible Notes were converted and in the subsequent period through April 24, 2018, we received notice of conversion of an additional $6 million principal value of 2041 Convertible Notes, which will settle in the quarter ending June 24, 2018, and all remaining 2018 Notes mature within the quarter ended June 24, 2018.
On October 13, 2017, we entered into Amendment No.
2 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “2nd Amendment”), among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, which amends the Company’s Credit Agreement (as amended by the 2nd Amendment, the “Amended Credit Agreement”).
The Amended Credit Agreement provides for an expansion option that will allow the Company, subject to certain requirements, to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $600 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.85 billion.
Other than as disclosed in this paragraph, the material terms of the Amended Credit Agreement are substantially the same as the Credit Agreement.
On November 13, 2017, we established a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.25 billion.
The net proceeds from the CP Program will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our Common Stock from time to time and under our stock repurchase program.
If at any time, funds are not available under favorable terms under CP Program, we may utilize the Amended Credit Agreement for funding.
Amounts available under the CP Program may be re-borrowed.
During the December 2017 quarter, a one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $991.3 million, has been recognized associated with the recent U.S. tax reform.
This value is identified as provisional in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 24, 2017 and March 25, 2018, and is subject to future measurement period adjustments under SAB 118.
The one-time transition tax may be elected to be paid over a period of eight years.
While we have substantial cash balances in the United States and offshore, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities.
We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.
ITEM 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
In March 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $2.0 billion of Common Stock.
These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law.
Repurchases will be funded using our on-shore cash, on-shore cash generation, and available credit facilities.
This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
On November 20, 2017, we entered into four separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the " November 2017 ASR") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $1.0 billion of Common Stock.
We took an initial delivery of 3,254,300 shares, which represented 70% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on November 20, 2017.
The total number of shares to be received under the November 2017 ASR will be based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount.
Approximately 1,019,000 shares were received at final settlement, which resulted in a weighted-average share price of approximately $189.03 for the transaction period.
Final settlement for the remaining transactions will be completed no later than May 24, 2018.
On April 19, 2017, we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the “April 2017 ASR”) with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $500 million of Common Stock.
We took an initial delivery of approximately 2,570,000 shares, which represented 70% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on April 19, 2017.
The total number of shares received under the April 2017 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount.
Approximately 780,000 shares were received at final settlement, which resulted in a weighted-average share price of approximately $149.16 for the transaction period.
