We maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act.
Moreover, we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100% effective all of the time.
Accordingly, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systemâ€™s objectives will be met.
As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of September 23, 2018, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e).
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, along with our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.
