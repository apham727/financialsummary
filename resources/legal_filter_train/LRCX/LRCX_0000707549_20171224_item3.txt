ITEM 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position as of December 24, 2017.
Our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates.
At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio.
We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk.
We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor.
The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification.
