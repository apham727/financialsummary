PCTEL delivers Performance Critical TELecom technology solutions to the wireless industry.
We are a leading global supplier of wireless network antenna and testing solutions.
The Connected Solutions segment designs and manufactures precision antennas.
PCTEL antennas are deployed in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in network equipment and devices for the Industrial Internet of Things.
Mobile operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on PCTEL to analyze, design, and optimize next generation wireless networks.
Effective August 2018, we consolidated our organizational structure.
All operating profit and cash flows are measured and managed at the enterprise level.
Our CODM assessed operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations.
Each segment had its own segment manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions.
We managed our balance sheet and cash flows centrally at the corporate level, with the exception of trade accounts receivable and inventory which was managed at the segment level.
All of our accounting and finance, human resources, information technology (“IT”) and legal functions were provided on a centralized basis through the corporate function.
Beginning with the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, we will not report any segment information.
Generally, revenue growth for the Connected Solutions segment is driven by the increased use of wireless communications and increased complexity trends occurring in these markets.
PCTEL antennas are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) providers where they are designed into the customer’s solution.
PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the antenna market.
These include radio frequency engineering, mobile antenna design and manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering.
Generally, revenue growth for the RF Solutions segment is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e., 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G, etc.
These include radio frequency engineering, digital signal processing engineering, manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering.
Revenues for the RF Solutions segment decreased 38.0% and 27.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers for legacy 4G wireless systems in preparation for the capital expenditures required for 5G deployments.
The gross profit decreased by 640 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and decreased by 560 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017.
The declines in gross profit were due to a higher mix of revenues from the Connected Solutions segment as well as a decline in the gross profit percentage for the Connected Solutions segment.
The gross profit for the Connected Solutions segment declined by 390 basis points and 380 basis points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, due to price pressure in the small cell vertical market and due to product mix.
The gross profit for the RF Solutions segment decreased by 790 and 460 basis points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to the impact of fixed costs over lower revenues.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, expenses for the Connected Solutions segment were higher by $0.3 million and expenses for the RF Solutions segment were approximately the same compared to the same period in the prior year.
The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 consists of higher expenses of $0.8 million for the Connected Solutions segment and higher expenses of $0.1 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year.
Expenses for both segments were higher compared to the prior year periods due to additional headcount and equipment required to support investments in growth areas.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses were lower by $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment and lower by $0.1 million for the Connected Solutions segment compared to the same period for each of the segments, respectively, in 2017.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018, sales commissions were lower by $0.2 million and product line and marketing expenses for the RF Solutions segment were lower by $0.1 million compared to the same period in 2017.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses for the Connected Solutions segment declined $0.4 million, offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses of $0.1 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in 2017.
General and administrative expenses declined by $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and declined by $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 because 2017 included incentive compensation expense and corporate expenses related to the CEO transition that were not included in 2018, offsetting expense related to the separation of the Senior Vice President and General Manager of the RF Solutions segment.
Amortization expense within operating expenses was $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017.
Amortization within operating expenses was $0.3 million and $0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The decrease in the expense for three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior year periods due to certain intangible assets for Connected Solutions being fully amortized as of June 30, 2018.
Stock compensation expense was higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 due to the acceleration of service-based restricted shares pursuant to a separation agreement executed in the third quarter 2018 for the Senior Vice President and General Manager of the RF Solutions segment, as well as an increase in the number of share awards in 2018 compared to 2017 and a higher share price for the awards granted in 2018 compared to 2017.
The Company recorded expense of $0.2 million within general and administrative expenses in the third quarter 2018 related to the acceleration of shares for the separation.
We reported a total operating loss of $2.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and an operating loss of $5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The operating losses were the result of lower profits for the RF Solutions segment and lower gross profits for the Connected Solutions segment.
Due to lower revenues, we recorded operating losses of $1.0 million and $1.8 million for RF Solutions segment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to income for the same periods in 2017.
Operating profit for the Connected Solutions segment was lower by approximately $1.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and lower by $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage.
Within the corporate function, expenses were lower by $0.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to lower expenses related to the Short-Term Incentive Plan and because the same periods in 2017 included expenses related to the CEO transition.
Our investment and cash equivalent balances declined during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 but the average balance was higher through the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.

During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we approved a plan to sell our Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift our focus toward research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products.
We sold the business to Gabe’s Construction on July 31, 2017.
See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to discontinued operations.
The results for Engineering Services are reported as discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The net income for the three months ended September 30, 2017 reflects a gain on the sale of the business of $0.5
million, offsetting a net operating loss of $0.1 million and income tax expense of $0.2 million.
The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflects a net operating loss of $0.7 million, offsetting a gain on the sale of the business of $0.5 million.
Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments.
The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares.
Within operating activities, we are historically a net generator of operating funds from our income statement activities.
In periods of expansion, we expect to use cash from our balance sheet.
Within investing activities, capital spending historically ranges between 2.0% and 4.0% of our revenues and the primary use of capital is for manufacturing and engineering development.
Our capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were approximately 3.6% of revenues.
We historically have significant transfers between investments and cash as we rotate our large cash balances and short-term investment balances between money market funds, which are accounted for as cash equivalents, and other investment vehicles.
Whether this activity results in our being a net user of funds versus a net generator of funds is largely dependent on our stock price during any given year.
Management believes that our cash and investments and no debt, combined with our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations.
Operating activities generated $4.1 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
We generated $1.1 million of cash from our income statement activities and generated $3.0 million of cash from the balance sheet.
Within the balance sheet, we generated cash primarily due to net collections of accounts receivable of $5.0 million, offsetting use of cash for net payments of accrued liabilities of $2.5 million.
September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to the payout of $1.7 million for the 2017 short-term incentive plan.
Operating activities from continuing operations provided $7.0 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
We generated $5.6 million of cash from our income statement activities and $1.5 million of cash from our balance sheet activities.
From the balance sheet activities, we generated cash of $0.7 million from decreases in accounts receivable and $1.8 million from reductions in inventories and used cash of $0.4 million from reductions in accrued liabilities and $1.1 million from reductions in accounts payable.
Inventories declined during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 for both Connected Solutions and RF Solutions due to process improvements related to purchasing and forecasting, as well as a decrease in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.

U.S. Tariffs
During the third quarter 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) imposed duties on certain Chinese imports containing industrially significant technologies, including certain PCTEL antenna and antenna components.
Duties of 25% became effective on July 6, 2018 and on August 23, 2018 and duties of 10% on additional products became effective on September 24, 2018.
During the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2018, $7.5 million of our customer
revenues were based on products subject to the new tariffs.
To recover the additional costs incurred because of these tariffs, we initiated a 20% upcharge to end customers of the products subject to the 25% tariffs.
The Company will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit.
However, the Company does not know the price elasticity of the unit volume based on the price increase.
