In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
Beginning January 1, 2019, we adopted ASC 842 “Leases”.
These changes included the development of new procedures related to the determination of lease classification, ongoing contract review requirements, and gathering of information to comply with disclosure requirements.
In January 2019, the Company entered into an eleven-year lease with FP Gateway 270 for 21,030 square feet of office space in Clarksburg, Maryland for our test and measurement product line.
This new office lease will replace the leased office in Germantown, Maryland.
The total lease obligations pursuant to the new lease agreement is approximately $5.4 million with a commencement date of January 1, 2020 and termination date of February 28, 2031.
