Conducting business in foreign countries involves additional financial, operating, and regulatory risks.
All of our employees in Tianjin, China are represented by a labor union, and our employees in Beijing, China are represented by a separate labor union pursuant to the requirements of Chinaâ€™s National Labor Law.
These two labor unions do not have collective bargaining rights.
We are in the process of transitioning several product lines from our Tianjin facility to additional contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere throughout 2019 and 2020.
We are currently negotiating severance arrangements for these workers.
In the third quarter 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative imposed duties on certain Chinese imports containing industrially significant technologies, including certain PCTEL antenna and antenna components, and there are additional tariffs under review.
We will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit.
In January 2019, the Company entered into an eleven-year lease with FP Gateway 270 for 21,030 square feet of office space in Clarksburg, Maryland for our test and measurement product line.
This new office lease will replace the leased office in Germantown, Maryland.
The total lease obligations pursuant to the new lease agreement is approximately $5.4 million with a commencement date of January 1, 2020 and termination date of February 28, 2031.
