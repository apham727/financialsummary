Revenues increased for the Connected Solutions segment by $0.6 million or 3.6%, but these higher revenues were offset when revenues for the RF Solutions segment declined by $0.5 million or 11.3%.
For the second quarter 2018, we recorded an operating loss of $1.6 million compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million in the second quarter 2017.
Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2018 of $43.3 million declined by $1.2 million or 2.6% compared to revenues of $44.5 million for the same period in 2017.
Revenues declined in the RF Solutions segment by $2.3 million or 21.9%, but revenues increased in the Connected Solutions segment by $1.1 million or 3.2%.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded an operating loss of $2.8 million compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million during the same period in 2017.
For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the increase in revenues for the Connected Solutions segment was due to increased sales in the Enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market, while the decrease in revenues for the RF Solutions segment was primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers and also lower revenues in the Asia Pacific region because 2017 included some large projects in China and Japan.
PCTEL delivers Performance Critical TELecom technology solutions to the wireless industry.
We are a leading global supplier of wireless network antenna and testing solutions.
PCTEL antennas are deployed in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in network equipment and devices for the Industrial Internet of Things.
Mobile operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on PCTEL to analyze, design, and optimize next generation wireless networks.
Each segment has its own segment manager as well as its own engineering, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions.
All of our accounting and finance, human resources, information technology (“IT”) and legal functions are provided on a centralized basis through the corporate function.
Generally, revenue growth for the Connected Solutions segment is driven by the increased use of wireless communications and increased complexity trends occurring in these markets.
PCTEL antennas are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) providers where they are designed into the customer’s solution.
PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the antenna market.
These include radio frequency engineering, mobile antenna design and manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering.
Generally, revenue growth for the RF Solutions segment is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e., 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G, etc.
These include radio frequency engineering, digital signal processing engineering, manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering.
Revenues for the Connected Solutions segment increased 3.6% and 3.2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 due to increased sales in the Enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market.
Revenues for the RF Solutions segment decreased 11.3% and 21.9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers for legacy 4G wireless systems in preparation for the capital expenditures required for 5G deployments.
RF Solution revenues were also lower in the Asia Pacific region because 2017 included some large projects in China and Japan.
The gross profit decreased by 560 basis points for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and decreased by 520 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017.
The declines in gross profit were due to a higher mix of revenues from the Connected Solutions segment as well as a decline in the gross profit percentage for the Connected Solutions segment.
The gross profit for the Connected Solutions segment declined by 520 basis points and 360 basis points for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, due to price pressure in the small cell vertical market and due to product mix.
The gross profit for the RF Solutions segment decreased by 250 and 310 basis points for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to the impact of fixed costs over lower revenues.
Research and development expenses increased approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and increased $0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017.
The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2018 consists of higher expenses of $0.2 million for the Connected Solutions segment and higher expenses of $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year.
The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2018 consists of higher expenses of $0.5 million for the Connected Solutions segment and higher expenses of $0.1 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year.
Expenses for both segments were higher compared to the prior year periods due to additional headcount and equipment required to support investments in growth areas.
Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and decreased $0.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses were higher by $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment and approximately even for the Connected Solutions segment compared to the same period in 2017.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses for the Connected Solutions segment declined $0.3 million, offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses of $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in 2017.
The expense increase for RF Solutions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was due to additions to sales and marketing headcount.
General and administrative expenses declined by $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and declined by $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 because 2017 included incentive compensation expense and corporate expenses related to the CEO transition that were not included in 2018 and other corporate expenses were lower in 2018.

Operating profit for the Connected Solutions segment was lower by approximately $0.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and lower by $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage.
We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
Our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $5.4 million and $5.2 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we approved a plan to sell our Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift our focus toward research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products.
We sold the business to Gabe’s Construction on July 31, 2017.
See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to discontinued operations.
The results for Engineering Services is reported as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
The net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 includes operating losses, net of income tax benefits.
At June 30, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately $36.5 million, and we had working capital of $55.6 million.
Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments.
The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares.
Within operating activities, we are historically a net generator of operating funds from our income statement activities.
Within investing activities, capital spending historically ranges between 2.0% and 4.0% of our revenues and the primary use of capital is for manufacturing and engineering development.
Our capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2018 were approximately 3.5% of revenues.
We historically have significant transfers between investments and cash as we rotate our large cash balances and short-term investment balances between money market funds, which are accounted for as cash equivalents, and other investment vehicles.
Whether this activity results in our being a net user of funds versus a net generator of funds is largely dependent on our stock price during any given year.
Management believes that our current financial position, which includes the $36.5 million in cash and investments and no debt, combined with our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations.
We generated $1.4 million of cash from our income statement activities and generated $0.6 million of cash from our balance sheet activities.
Accrued liabilities were lower at June 30, 2018, primarily due to the payout of $1.7 million for the 2017 short-term incentive plan.
Accounts payable was higher at June 30, 2018 because we extended the payment cycle for certain vendors to match accounts receivable collections and due to the timing of purchases during the second quarter 2018.
Inventories were higher for the Connected Solutions segment in both the U.S. and China.
Operating activities from continuing operations provided $4.4 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2017.
We generated $3.2 million of cash from our income statement activities and $1.2 million of cash from our balance sheet activities.
From the balance sheet activities, we generated cash of $1.5 million from decreases in accounts receivable and $0.8 million from reductions in inventories and used cash of $0.7 million from reductions in accrued liabilities and $0.2 million from reductions in accounts payable.
Inventories declined during the six months ended June 30, 2017 for both Connected Solutions and RF Solutions due to process improvements related to purchasing and forecasting, as well as a decrease in revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.
Accounts receivable declined during the six months ended June 30, 2017 due to the decrease in revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.

U.S. Tariffs
Effective July 6, 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) imposed duties of 25% on certain Chinese imports containing industrially significant technologies, including certain PCTEL antenna and antenna components.
During the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2018, $7.5 million of our customer revenues were based on products subject to the new tariffs.
In July, we initiated a 20% upcharge to end customers of these products to recover the impact of the additional costs for these U.S. tariffs.
The Company will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit.
However, the Company does not know the price elasticity of the unit volume based on the price increase.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these additional tariffs.
We use certain critical accounting policies as described in “Item 7.
There have been no material changes in any of our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2017.
See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on recent accounting pronouncements and see Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to revenue recognition policies.
