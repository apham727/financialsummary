We are the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of our business.
Conducting business in foreign countries involves additional financial, operating, and regulatory risks.
All our Tianjin, China employees are represented by a labor union, and our employees in Beijing, China are represented by a separate labor union pursuant to the requirements of China’s National Labor Law.
These two labor unions do not have collective bargaining rights.
We expect the transition to be substantially completed by the end of our 2020 fiscal year (the “Transition Period”) and we expect to recognize cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $1.0 million consisting of severance and other transition costs.
It is expected that a total of approximately 140 positions, or approximately 35% of the Company’s entire full-time global workforce, will be eliminated over the course of the Transition Period at an aggregate cost of approximately $0.9 million.
These separation costs will be paid in cash.
Other non-cash costs associated with the transition to contract manufacturers include fixed asset dispositions estimated to be $0.1 million.
We anticipate that these charges will be recognized as restructuring expenses during the third and fourth quarter of 2019.
We expect to make cash payments for employee separation costs during the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020.
We expect to retain the lease on our Tianjin facility for manufacturing of lower-volume, highly-customized antenna products and for administration of remaining China operations with a workforce of approximately 65 personnel until the end of the facility’s current lease term in October 2020, and thereafter intends to continue such manufacturing activities to the extent that we are successful in negotiating an extension of the lease term at a reasonable cost.
In the third quarter 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative imposed duties on certain Chinese imports containing industrially significant technologies, including certain PCTEL antenna and antenna components, and additional tariffs may be instituted.
We will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit.
