Our third quarter 2019 revenues were $23.6 million and increased by $5.2 million or 28.2% compared to revenues of $18.4 million for the same period in 2018.
Third quarter 2019 revenues increased by $3.7 million or 103.6% to $7.2 million for the test and measurement products compared to the third quarter 2018 and increased by $1.6 million or 10.7% to $16.5 million for the antenna products.
Revenues increased for the antenna products due to higher revenues with intelligent transportation products.
The gross profit of $10.6 million, increased by $3.9 million compared to the same period in 2018 due to both a higher product mix of test and measurement product line revenues and an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
Primarily based on higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $2.4 million during the third quarter 2018.
Antenna product revenues decreased by $2.6 million or 5.1% to $47.6 million primarily due to lower revenues with enterprise Wi-Fi applications and small cell antennas.
Revenues increased for the test and measurement products due to sales of 5G products for early deployment.
Because of higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to an operating loss of $5.2 million for the same period in 2018.
PCTEL antenna are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where the antennas are designed into the customer’s solution.
Competition in the antenna markets is fragmented.
Our test and measurement products are sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEM providers who integrate our products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers.
Competitors for PCTEL’s test tool products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Berkley Varitronics, Digital Receiver Technology, and Rohde and Schwarz.
Effective August 2018, we consolidated our organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the Industrial IoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G (the “Reorganization”).
As a result of the Reorganization, our Chief Executive Officer, as the CODM, began assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations.
In connection with the Reorganization, the Board of Directors appointed a Chief Operating Officer who maintains regular contact with the CODM to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and plans for our businesses.
All operating profit and cash flows are measured and managed at the enterprise level.
Our CODM assessed operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations.
This Form 10-Q does not include segment reporting information; however, we have included revenues and gross profit for the two major product lines (antenna products and test and measurement products) because each product line has a significantly different gross profit profile.
On August 7, 2019 the Board of Directors approved a transition plan for our China manufacturing operations.
We expect the transition to be substantially completed by the end of our 2020 fiscal year (the “Transition Period”) and we expect to recognize cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $1.0 million consisting of severance and other transition costs.
Approximately $0.9 million of severance costs will be paid in cash.
Other non-cash costs associated with the transition to contract manufacturers include fixed asset dispositions estimated to be $0.1 million.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Company eliminated 49 positions and recorded restructuring expense of $0.3 million.

The gross profit percentage increased by 8.6% and 8.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 because of a higher ratio of revenues from test and measurement products and because of higher gross profits for antenna products.

Research and development expenses increased $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018.

The full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was $14.5 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
We recorded positive pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, but nevertheless recorded cumulative three-year pre-tax losses as of September 30, 2019.
Due to the sensitivity of the analysis, changes to the assumptions in subsequent periods could have a material effect on the valuation allowance.
For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, higher gross margins as well as other income offset higher operating expenses Gross margins increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to same periods in 2018 due to a higher mix of test and measurement product revenues and an improvement in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
