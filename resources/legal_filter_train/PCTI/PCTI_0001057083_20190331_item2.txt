The following information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “2018 Form 10-K”).
Such statements constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Our first quarter 2019 revenues of $20.6 million decreased by $1.1 million or 5.3% compared to revenues of $21.7 million for the same period in 2018.
Revenues decreased for the antenna product line by $2.7 million or 15.1% and increased for the test and measurement product line by $1.5 million or 38.4% compared to the first quarter 2018.
Revenues decreased for the antenna product line due to lower revenues with Enterprise Wi-Fi applications and increased for the test and measurement due to sales of 5G products.
The gross profit of $8.7 million, increased by $0.8 million, or 10.1% compared to gross profit of $7.9M for the same period in 2018, due to a higher mix of test and measurement product revenues and due to an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
Primarily based on higher gross margins, we recorded a lower operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the first quarter 2018.
The operating loss was $0.5 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
PCTEL antenna are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where the antennas are designed into the customer’s solution.
Competition in the antenna markets is fragmented.
Our test and measurement products are sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEM providers who integrate our products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers.
Competitors for PCTEL’s test tool products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Berkley Varitronics, Digital Receiver Technology, and Rohde and Schwarz.
Effective August 2018, we consolidated our organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the Industrial IoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G (the “Reorganization”).
As a result of the Reorganization, our Chief Executive Officer, as the CODM, began assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations.
Our CODM assessed operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations.
Each segment had its own general manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions.
In order to understand our financial results, it is necessary to understand the impact on gross profit of the revenue mix between them.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the decrease in revenues for the antenna product line was due to lower sales for Enterprise Wi-Fi applications.
Revenues for the test and measurement product line increased 38.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to sales of test equipment in connection with early deployments of 5G infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
The gross profit percentage increased by 5.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 because of a higher ratio of revenues from test and measurement products and because of higher gross profits for antenna products.
Higher margin test and measurement products comprised 27% of the revenues in the first quarter 2019 compared to 18% of the revenues in the first quarter 2018.
The gross profit percentage for the antenna product line increased by 2.9% due to more favorable product mix and due to cost reductions.
The increase is primarily due to spending on investments for 5G test and measurement equipment and for wireless products development for Industrial IoT.
General and administrative expenses increased by $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 as cash-based incentive compensation expense of $0.1 million, equity-based compensation expense of $0.1 million and legal expenses of $0.1 million offset reductions in executive management related to the Reorganization in 2018.
Amortization expense within operating expenses was $73 and $124 for each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The decrease in amortization expense was due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized during 2018.
Under the 2019 STIP, certain executive and managers will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares of the Company’s stock.
Other income, net consists of interest income, foreign exchange losses, and interest expense.
We recorded income tax expense of $10 for the three months ended March 31, 2019, and an income tax benefit of $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The tax benefit recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was higher than the statutory rate by approximately 6% due to permanent differences and estimated research credits.
Our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $14.5 million at March 31, 2019 and at December 31, 2018.
We considered multiple factors in our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance.
The full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was $14.5 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
We also recorded a net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Due to the sensitivity of the analysis, changes to the assumptions in subsequent periods could have a material effect on the valuation allowance.
Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments.
The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares.
Within operating activities, we are historically a net generator of operating funds from our income statement activities.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, our balance sheet provided operating funds.
In periods of expansion, we expect to use cash from our balance sheet.
Within investing activities, capital spending historically ranges between 2.0% and 4.0% of our revenues and the primary use of capital is for manufacturing, engineering, and product development.
Our capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2019 were approximately 1.5% of revenues.
We historically have significant transfers between investments and cash as we rotate our large cash balances and short-term investment balances between money market funds, which are accounted for as cash equivalents, and other investment vehicles.
Whether this activity results in our being a net user of funds versus a net generator of funds is largely dependent on our stock price during any given year.
At March 31, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately $35.0 million, and we had working capital of $52.4 million.
Management believes that our cash and investments provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations given our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) and our lack of debt.
Operating activities generated $1.5 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Operating activities used $1.6 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
We generated $0.5 million of cash from our income statement activities and used $2.1 million of cash from our balance sheet activities.
Within the balance sheet activities, we used cash due to lower accrued liabilities of $1.8 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $0.4 million, offsetting cash generated from a decline of $0.3 million in inventories.
Accrued liabilities were lower at March 31, 2018 due to the payout of $1.7 million for the 2017 short-term incentive plan.
Accounts receivable were higher despite lower revenues due to longer payment terms granted and a higher percentage of revenues were generated in the third month of the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
U.S. inventories declined during the three months ended March 31, 2018 for the antenna product line.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $14.2 million in funds and we rotated $13.9 million of cash into new short-term investments.
We used $0.3 million for capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Our investing activities provided $9.3 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $17.5 million in funds and we rotated $7.3 million of cash into new short-term investments.

Balances for purchases currently recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet are excluded.
We do not know the timing of the settlement of this liability.
We use certain critical accounting policies as described in “Item 7.
There have been no material changes in any of our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2018.
