Recent indicators continue to suggest a mixed trend in economic activity among the different geographical regions.
North America and EMEA are experiencing moderate economic growth.
Our Asia region continues to grow faster than any other region in which we do business.
Our most significant commodity and foreign currency exposures are related to lead and the Euro, respectively.
Over the past year, on a consolidated basis, we have experienced rising commodity costs.
Our selling prices fluctuated during the last several years to offset the volatile cost of commodities.
Approximately 30% of our revenue is currently subject to agreements that adjust pricing to a market-based index for lead.
During the nine months of fiscal 2018, we increased our selling prices in response to increased commodity costs.
We believe that our financial position is strong, and we have substantial liquidity with $571 million of available cash and cash equivalents and available and undrawn credit lines of approximately $504 million at December 31, 2017 to cover short-term liquidity requirements and anticipated growth in the foreseeable future.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a new credit facility (“2017 Credit Facility”) that comprises a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2022.
We repaid the existing facility (“2011 Credit Facility”), which comprised a $500 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2011 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured incremental term loan (the “2011 Term Loan”) with the proceeds of the new facility.
We believe that the 2017 Credit Facility provides us with sufficient liquidity to fund acquisitions and stock repurchase programs.
Share repurchases and a decline in our share price helped offset the dilutive impact of stock awards in the nine months of fiscal 2018.
The Company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic and foreign liquidity.

Operating earnings increased $13.3 million or 24.4% and increased $18.0 million or 9.8% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017.
Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, increased 60 basis points and 10 basis points, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017.
The Americas segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, decreased 240 basis points and 100 basis points, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, when compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher commodity costs partially offset by price recoveries and cost saving initiatives.
Excluding the impact of the $6.3 million write-off of previously capitalized costs relating to the ERP system implementation during the nine months of fiscal 2017, operating earnings in the nine months of fiscal 2018 decreased by 160 basis points compared to the prior year period.
The EMEA segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges and legal proceedings charge discussed above, decreased 40 and 140 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase in lead cost, partially offset by price recoveries and cost saving initiatives.
Operating earnings decreased 220 basis points and 90 basis points in the Asia segment in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher commodity costs, partially offset by price recoveries and a slow down in telecom spending during the first half of fiscal 2018 in the People's Republic of China.
Interest expense of $6.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 (net of interest income of $0.8 million) was $0.9 million higher than the interest expense of $5.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (net of interest income of $0.5 million).
The increase in interest expense in both the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 is primarily due to higher average debt outstanding.
The increase in our average debt was primarily to fund treasury repurchase activity as discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
Included in interest expense are non-cash charges for deferred financing fees of $0.3 million and $1.3 million, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, and $0.3 million and $1.0 million, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively.
Other (income) expense, net in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was income of $0.6 million compared to income of $1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Other (income) expense, net in the nine months of fiscal 2018 was expense of $4.7 million compared to income of $0.4 million in the nine months of fiscal 2017.
Foreign currency impact resulted in a gain of $0.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and a loss of $4.4 million in nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to foreign currency gain of $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in the comparable prior year periods.
As a result of the above, earnings before income taxes in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $11.9 million, or 23.5%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and increased $11.0 million, or 6.5%, in the nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the nine months of fiscal 2017.
The tax provision for the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods.
These amounts are considered provisional and may be affected by future guidance if and when issued.

The rate increase in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2017 is primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, offset by the German regulatory proceedings charge of $17.0 million (with no associated tax benefit) recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions.
Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 64% for fiscal 2018 compared to 60% for fiscal 2017.
The foreign effective income tax rates for the nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017 were 11.4% and 15.9%, respectively.
The rate decrease compared to the prior year period is primarily due to the German regulatory proceedings charge of $17.0 million (with no associated tax benefit) recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions.
In the nine months of fiscal 2018, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $65.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $40.3 million, stock-based compensation of $14.8 million, deferred taxes benefit of $7.2 million, non-cash interest of $1.3 million and provision for doubtful accounts of $0.8 million.
Cash provided by earnings as adjusted for non-cash items was improved by an increase of $89.2 million in long term liabilities primarily due to the one-time transition tax liability the Tax Act and was partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $42.0 million, net of currency translation changes, and a decrease in accrued expenses of $30.5 million, comprising primarily of legal proceedings related payments, payroll related expenses and income taxes.
In the nine months of fiscal 2017, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $124.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $40.5 million, non-cash charges consisting of write-offs relating to restructuring and other exit charges and ERP implementation of $7.7 million, stock-based compensation of $14.6 million, provision of doubtful accounts of $2.0 million and non-cash interest of $1.0 million.

As explained in the discussion of our use of “non-GAAP financial measures,” we monitor the level and percentage of primary working capital to sales.
Primary working capital for this purpose is trade accounts receivable, plus inventories, minus trade accounts payable.
The primary working capital percentage of 26.2% at December 31, 2017 is 130 basis points higher than that for March 31, 2017, and is 90 basis points lower than that for the prior year period.
