The four quarters in fiscal 2020 end on June 30, 2019, September 29, 2019, December 29, 2019, and March 31, 2020, respectively. The four quarters in fiscal 2019 ended on July 1, 2018, September 30, 2018, December 30, 2018, and March 31, 2019, respectively.

•to apply the short-term lease exception to leases that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. 
Upon adoption, the Company recorded Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities of approximately $84,878 and $87,248, respectively. In addition, capital lease assets and liabilities are now classified as finance lease right-of-use assets and liabilities. The difference between the operating lease assets and lease liabilities primarily relates to unamortized lease incentives and deferred rent recorded in accordance with the previous lease guidance.
The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” on April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. There was no cumulative effect of adopting the standard at the date of initial application in retained earnings. 
The Company's revenues by reportable segments are presented in Note 17. 
Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation. Control for these services passes to the customer as the services are performed. Service revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $61,282 and $37,105, respectively. Service revenues for the six months of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $122,000 and $69,200, respectively.
A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require the bundling of both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definition for a distinct performance obligation. These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin. For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement. Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production. Revenues recognized over time for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $33,595 and $16,491, respectively. Revenues recognized over time for the six months of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $75,090 and $34,895, respectively.
On September 29, 2019, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was approximately $65,975, of which, the Company estimates that approximately $48,576 will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2020, $16,621 in fiscal 2021, $643 in fiscal 2022, $16 in fiscal 2023 and $119 in fiscal 2024. 
Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $46,319 and $38,778 as of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. 
The Company uses historic customer product return data as a basis of estimation for customer returns and records the reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized. At September 29, 2019, the right of return asset related to the value of inventory anticipated to be returned from customers was $2,667 and refund liability representing amounts estimated to be refunded to customers was $5,213.
The Company leases manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, office space, vehicles and other equipment under non-cancellable leases with initial terms typically ranging from 1 to 17 years. At contract inception, the Company reviews the terms of the arrangement to determine if the contract is or contains a lease. Guidance in Topic 842 is used to evaluate whether the contract has an identified asset; if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset; and if it has the right to direct the use of the underlying asset. When determining if a contract has an identified asset, the Company considers both explicit and implicit assets, and whether the supplier has the right to substitute the asset. When determining if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset, the Company considers the primary outputs of the identified asset throughout the period of use and determines if it receives greater than 90% of those benefits. When determining if it has the right to direct the use of an underlying asset, the Company considers if it has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use and if it controls the decision-making rights over the asset. 
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company exercises its judgment to determine the term of those leases when extension or termination options are present and include such options in the calculation of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options. 
The Company has elected to include both lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease payments for all asset classes. Payments made to a lessor for items such as taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, or other costs commonly referred to as executory costs, are also included in lease payments if they are fixed. The fixed portion of these payments are included in the calculation of the lease liability, while any variable portion would be recognized as variable lease expenses, when incurred. Variable payments made to third parties for these, or similar costs, such as utilities, are not included in the calculation of lease payments.
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense includes depreciation, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the leased asset, and interest expense, which is recognized following an effective interest rate method.
On December 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Alpha Technologies Services, Inc. (“ATS”) and Alpha Technologies Ltd. (“ATL”), resulting in ATS and ATL becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “share purchase”). Additionally, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Alpha Technologies Inc. and certain assets of Altair Advanced Industries, Inc. and other affiliates of ATS and ATL (all such sellers, together with ATS and ATL, “Alpha”), in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain restructuring agreements (collectively, the “asset acquisition” and together with the share purchase, the “acquisition”). Based in Bellingham, Washington, Alpha is a global industry leader in comprehensive commercial-grade energy solutions for broadband, telecom, renewable, industrial and traffic customers around the world. The initial purchase consideration for the acquisition was $750,000, of which $650,000 was paid in cash and the balance was settled by issuing 1,177,630 shares of EnerSys common stock. These shares were issued out of the Company's treasury stock and were valued at $84.92 per share, which was based on the thirty-day volume weighted average stock price of the Company’s common stock at closing, in accordance with the purchase agreement. The 1,177,630 shares had a closing date fair value of $93,268, based upon the December 7, 2018 closing date spot rate of $79.20. The total purchase consideration, consisting of cash paid of $650,000, shares valued at $93,268 and an adjustment for working capital (due post - closing from seller of $766), was $742,502. The Company funded the cash portion of the acquisition with borrowings from the Amended Credit Facility as defined in Note 12. See Note 12 for additional information. 
The acquisition expands the Company's footprint in broadband and telecom markets. The goodwill recognized in connection with this transaction reflects the benefits the Company expects to realize from being able to provide a one-stop, fully integrated power solutions offering to its customers, as well as the benefit of cost synergies from alignment of the Alpha group within its own organizational structure.
The results of operations of Alpha have been included in the Company’s Americas segment. 
The following table represents the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill. The amounts recognized will be finalized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained, but no later than one year from the acquisition date (“the measurement period”).
The Company recorded the acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting and recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill. Estimated goodwill deductible for tax purposes is $42,262. The measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is substantially complete. The Company continues to gather necessary information to finalize the accounting for income taxes associated with the acquisition, and as such the Company could record additional adjustments to the provisional amount recognized as this additional information is obtained.
The Company’s amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was $7,309 and $14,625, for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to$2,046 and $4,115 for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019, respectively.

The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2019 Annual Report.
The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.
The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities. 
The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility (as defined in Note 12), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2.
The Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), with an original face value of $300,000, were issued in April 2015. The fair value of the Notes represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2. The Notes were trading at approximately 102% and 99% of face value on September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. 
The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases. Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. At September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 54.0 million pounds and 42.0 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $49,938 and $39,218, respectively.

The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had entered into a total of $45,350 and $42,318, respectively, of such contracts.

These are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded directly in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the notional amount of these contracts was $23,676 and $22,201, respectively. 
10. Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation
Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants. 
The Company settled the Belgian regulatory proceeding in February 2016 by acknowledging certain anticompetitive practices and conduct and agreeing to pay a fine of $1,962, which was paid in March 2016. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company also paid $1,272 towards certain aspects related to this matter, which are under appeal.
