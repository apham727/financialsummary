In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No.
2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” providing guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
1. identify the contract with a customer;
3. determine the transaction price;
4. allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
5. recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company recognizes revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the performance obligation to a customer.
Control of a performance obligation may transfer to the customer either at a point in time or over time depending on an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances for each contract, including the terms and conditions of the contract as agreed with the customer, as well as the nature of the products or services to be provided.
Each customer purchase order sets forth the transaction price for the products and services purchased under that arrangement.
Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation.
Control for these services passes to the customer as the services are performed.
Service revenues for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 amounted to $37,472 and $106,672, respectively.
A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require the bundling of both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definitions for a distinct performance obligation.
These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin.
For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement.
Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production.
Revenues recognized over time for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 amounted to $19,421 and $54,316, respectively.
On December 30, 2018, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was approximately $97,189, of which, the Company estimates that approximately $34,244 will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2019, $47,032 in fiscal 2020, $10,023 in fiscal 2021, $5,738 in fiscal 2022 and $152 in fiscal 2023.
The Company's typical payment terms are 30 days and sales arrangements do not contain any significant financing component for its customers.
As of December 30, 2018, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $24,736 and $7,430, respectively.
As of March 31, 2018, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $9,387 and $7,094, respectively.
Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $31,916 and $24,810 as of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
Revenues recognized during the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, that were included in the contract liability at the beginning of the current quarter and nine months, amounted to $1,950 and $2,695, respectively.
The Company uses historic customer product return data as a basis of estimation for customer returns and records the reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized.
At December 30, 2018, the right of return asset related to the value of inventory anticipated to be returned from customers was $2,647 and refund liability representing amounts estimated to be refunded to customers was $5,013.
If shipping activities are performed after a customer obtains control of a product, the Company applies a policy election to account for shipping as an activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the product to the customer.
The Company applies a policy election to exclude transaction taxes collected from customers from sales when the tax is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction.
The Company generally provides customers with a product warranty that provides assurance that the products meet standard specifications and are free of defects.
The Company maintains a reserve for claims incurred under standard product warranty programs.
Performance obligations related to service warranties are not material to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company pays sales commissions to its sales representatives, which may be considered as incremental costs to obtain a contract.
However, since the recoverability period is less than one year, the Company has utilized the practical expedient to record these costs of obtaining a contract as an expense as they are incurred.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e.
This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee.
This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
In order to evaluate the impact of ASU No.
This evaluation process includes a review of the Company's leasing contracts and an assessment of the completeness of the Company's lease population.
The Company is anticipating electing available practical expedients, including the transition option, upon adoption on April 1, 2019.
The Company is also currently implementing a software tool and concurrently identifying changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard.

The Company funded the cash portion of the acquisition with borrowings from the Amended Credit Facility as defined in Note 10.
The acquisition expands the Company's footprint in broadband and telecom markets.
The Company recorded the acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting and recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.
The results of operations of Alpha have been included in the Company’s Americas segment beginning December 8, 2018.

Alpha recorded a net loss of $4,440 for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 ended December 30, 2018, excluding the effect of the transaction and integration costs, and interest expense on the debt to finance the acquisition.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill.
information necessary to complete the analyses is obtained, but no later than December 7, 2019 or one year from the acquisition date (“the measurement period”).
The preliminary purchase price of the acquisition has been allocated to the Company’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated acquisition date fair values.
The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill.
The preliminary allocation of purchase price is based upon a valuation undertaken by the Company and is subject to change during the measurement period.
The initial accounting for the acquisition is incomplete pending final valuation of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The pro forma results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 exclude pre-tax transaction costs of $10,192 and $12,360, respectively, as well as the pre-tax amortization of the acquisition date step up to fair value of inventories of $3,747 (these were recognized in the actual results of the third quarter and nine months fiscal 2019) as they are considered non-recurring in nature.
The Company’s amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was $3,105 and $7,220, for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively.
The expected amortization expense based on the finite-lived intangible assets as of December 30, 2018, is $1,766 for the remainder of fiscal 2019, $8,281 in fiscal 2020, $8,023 in fiscal 2021, $7,941 in fiscal 2022 and $5,689 in fiscal 2023.
The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2018 Annual Report.
The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.
The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities.

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures.
As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the notional amount of these contracts was $48,131 and $54,164, respectively.
