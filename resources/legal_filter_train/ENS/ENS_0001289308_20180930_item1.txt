The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (SEC File No. 001-32253), which was filed on May 30, 2018 (the “2018 Annual Report”).
EnerSys (the “Company”) reports interim financial information for 13-week periods, except for the first quarter, which always begins on April 1, and the fourth quarter, which always ends on March 31. The four quarters in fiscal 2019 end on July 1, 2018, September 30, 2018, December 30, 2018, and March 31, 2019, respectively. The four quarters in fiscal 2018 ended on July 2, 2017, October 1, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” providing guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. 
1. identify the contract with a customer;
4. allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
5. recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company recognizes revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the performance obligation to a customer. Control of a performance obligation may transfer to the customer either at a point in time or over time depending on an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances for each contract, including the terms and conditions of the contract as agreed with the customer, as well as the nature of the products or services to be provided.
Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation. Control for these services passes to the customer as the services are performed. Service revenues for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019 amounted to $37,105 and $69,200, respectively.
A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require the bundling of both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definitions for a distinct performance obligation. These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin. For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement. Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production. Revenues recognized over time for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019 amounted to $16,491 and $34,895, respectively.
On September 30, 2018, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was approximately $75,420, of which, the Company estimates that approximately $33,076 will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2019, $33,944 in fiscal 2020, $4,655 in fiscal 2021, $3,723 in fiscal 2022 and $22 in fiscal 2023. 
The Company's typical payment terms are 30 days and sales arrangements do not contain any significant financing component for its customers. 
Any payments that are received from a customer in advance, prior to the satisfaction of a related performance obligation and billings in excess of revenue recognized, are deferred and treated as a contract liability. Advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when recognition of revenue is expected. As of September 30, 2018, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $9,518 and $7,009, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $9,387 and $7,094, respectively. Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $22,805 and $24,810 as of September 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively. Revenues recognized during the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019, that were included in the contract liability at the beginning of the current quarter and six months, amounted to $661 and $2,597, respectively.
The Company uses historic customer product return data as a basis of estimation for customer returns and records the reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized. At September 30, 2018, the right of return asset related to the value of inventory anticipated to be returned from customers was $2,647 and refund liability representing amounts estimated to be refunded to customers was $5,013.
Freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. If shipping activities are performed after a customer obtains control of a product, the Company applies a policy election to account for shipping as an activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the product to the customer. 
The Company generally provides customers with a product warranty that provides assurance that the products meet standard specifications and are free of defects. The Company maintains a reserve for claims incurred under standard product warranty programs. Performance obligations related to service warranties are not material to the consolidated financial statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)”, which requires an entity to report the service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the same line item as other compensation costs. The other components of net (benefit) cost will be required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted and requires the retrospective method to be applied to all periods presented. The Company adopted this guidance effective April 1, 2018. The service cost component of pension expense continues to be recognized in cost of goods sold whereas other components of pension expense have been reclassified to “Other (income) expense, net” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company reclassified $374 and $735, from “Cost of goods sold” relating to the second quarter and six months of 2018, respectively, to “Other (income) expense, net” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. In order to evaluate the impact of ASU No. 2016-02, the Company has formed a project team and initiated the process of assessing critical components of this new guidance and the potential impact that the guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This evaluation process includes a review of the Company's leasing contracts and an assessment of the completeness of the Company's lease population. The Company is also assessing the need for potential changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support the adoption of the new standard. Based upon the assessment to date, the Company believes that a key change upon adoption of the lease standard will be the recognition of leased assets and liabilities on its balance sheet but has not yet determined the impact on its results of operations or statement of cash flows.
The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2018 Annual Report.
The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.
The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities. 
The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the 2017 Credit Facility (as defined in Note 9), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2.
The Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), with an original face value of $300,000, were issued in April 2015. The fair value of the Notes represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2. The Notes were trading at approximately 100% and 102% of face value on September 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively. 
The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases. Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. At September 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 68.9 million pounds and 62.9 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $67,543 and $72,207, respectively.
The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. As of September 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the notional amount of these contracts was $54,742 and $54,164, respectively.
The consolidated effective income tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 18.6% and 21.7%, respectively, and for the six months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 19.1% and 21.2%, respectively. The rate decrease in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2018 is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and items related to the Tax Act. The Tax Act items accounted for a net decrease of 2.2% comprising a 4.5% decrease for the rate change, a 0.5% decrease for the FDII deduction and a 2.8% increase for GILTI inclusion.
