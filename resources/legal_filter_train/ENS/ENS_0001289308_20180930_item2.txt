Recent indicators continue to suggest a mixed trend in economic activity among the different geographical regions.
North America and EMEA are experiencing moderate economic growth, with the economic growth in the United States accelerating.
Our Asia region continues to grow faster than any other region in which we do business.
Our most significant commodity and foreign currency exposures are related to lead and the Euro, respectively.
Over the past year, on a consolidated basis, we have experienced rising commodity costs.
Our selling prices fluctuated during the last several years to offset the volatile cost of commodities.
Approximately 30% of our revenue is currently subject to agreements that adjust pricing to a market-based index for lead.
During the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019, where permitted, we increased our selling prices in response to increased commodity costs including other raw materials and freight.
We believe that our financial position is strong, and we have substantial liquidity with $545 million of available cash and cash equivalents and available and undrawn credit lines of approximately $531 million at September 30, 2018 to cover short-term liquidity requirements and anticipated growth in the foreseeable future.
In fiscal 2018, we entered into a new credit facility (“2017 Credit Facility”) that comprises a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2022, which provides us with sufficient liquidity to fund acquisitions and stock repurchase programs.
The majority of that cash and investments is expected to be utilized to fund local operating activities, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions.
The Company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic and foreign liquidity.
We believe that our strong capital structure and liquidity affords us access to capital for future capital expenditures, acquisition and stock repurchase opportunities and continued dividend payments.

The decrease in interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to lower average debt and the repayment of our high interest debt in South America, offset by higher interest rates.
The increase in interest expense in the six months of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower average debt.
Our average debt outstanding was $628.3 million and $619.8 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019 compared to $680.5 million and $654.5 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018.

Other (income) expense, net in the six months of fiscal 2019 was income of $0.9 million compared to expense of $6.1 million in the six months of fiscal 2018.
Foreign currency impact resulted in a gain of $1.8 million and $2.2 million, in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to a foreign currency loss of $2.5 million and $5.1 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018, respectively.
2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)” in fiscal 2019 resulted in pension expense components other than service, being recorded in Other (income) expense, net.

The rate decrease in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2018 is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and items related to the Tax Act.
The Tax Act items accounted for a net decrease of 2.2% comprising a 4.5% decrease for the rate change, a 0.5% decrease for the FDII deduction and a 2.8% increase for GILTI inclusion.
Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 68% for fiscal 2019 compared to 63% for fiscal 2018.
The foreign effective income tax rates for the six months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 11.1% and 11.2%, respectively.

See Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1- Basis of Presentation, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, for further information on the adoption of ASC 606.
The Company issued performance condition-based awards in the second quarter ended September 30, 2018.
The fair value of performance condition based awards are recognized as compensation expense beginning at the time in which the performance conditions are deemed probable of achievement, which the Company assesses at each reporting period.
Once a performance condition is considered probable, the Company records compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that award, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining requisite service period using the straight method as the awards are subject to cliff vesting.
