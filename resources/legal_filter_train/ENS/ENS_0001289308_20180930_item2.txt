Recent indicators continue to suggest a mixed trend in economic activity among the different geographical regions. North America and EMEA are experiencing moderate economic growth, with the economic growth in the United States accelerating. Our Asia region continues to grow faster than any other region in which we do business.
We believe that our financial position is strong, and we have substantial liquidity with $545 million of available cash and cash equivalents and available and undrawn credit lines of approximately $531 million at September 30, 2018 to cover short-term liquidity requirements and anticipated growth in the foreseeable future.
In fiscal 2018, we entered into a new credit facility (“2017 Credit Facility”) that comprises a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2022, which provides us with sufficient liquidity to fund acquisitions and stock repurchase programs.
A substantial majority of the Company’s cash and investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. The majority of that cash and investments is expected to be utilized to fund local operating activities, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions. The Company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic and foreign liquidity.
We believe that our strong capital structure and liquidity affords us access to capital for future capital expenditures, acquisition and stock repurchase opportunities and continued dividend payments.
Net sales increased $43.2 million or 7.0% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This increase was the result of a 7% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. 
Net sales increased $91.5 million or 7.4% in the six months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the six months of fiscal 2018. This increase was the result of a 6% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 1% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. 
The Americas segment’s net sales increased $47.1 million or 13.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 12% increase in organic volume and a 3% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 1% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. Net sales increased $85.0 million or 12.2% in the six months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the six months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 11% increase in organic volume and a 3% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. 
The EMEA segment’s net sales increased $6.1 million or 3.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 6% increase in organic volume, partially offset by a 3% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. Net sales increased $17.5 million or 4.4% in the six months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the six months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 3% increase in organic volume and a 1% increase in pricing. 
The Asia segment’s net sales decreased $10.0 million or 12.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 14% decrease in organic volume partially offset by a 1% increase in pricing. Net sales decreased $11.0 million or 7.6% in the six months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the six months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 10% decrease in organic volume and a 1% increase each in pricing and foreign currency translation impact. 
Net sales of our reserve power products in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $21.2 million or 7.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to a 7% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. Net sales increased $40.0 million or 6.7% in the six months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the six months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 6% increase in organic volume and a 1% increase in pricing. 
Net sales of our motive power products in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by $22.0 million or 6.8% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to a 7% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact.

Gross profit increased $0.6 million or 0.4% in the second quarter and increased $2.4 million or 0.8% in the six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2018. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 160 basis points in both the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018, respectively. This decrease in the gross profit margin in both the second quarter and six months is primarily due to an increase in commodity costs of approximately $14 million and $30 million, respectively, which were offset by increases in organic volume and pricing, but still resulted in gross margin dilution.
Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased 70 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and decreased 40 basis points in the six months of fiscal 2019, compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of the foreign currency translation, the increase in dollars was primarily due to payroll related expenses. 
Included in our second quarter of fiscal 2018 operating results are restructuring charges of $0.3 million in Americas and $1.5 million in EMEA.The charges in Americas related to the sale of the building at our Cleveland, Ohio charger manufacturing facility in the U.S., which ceased operations in fiscal 2017, while charges in EMEA related to restructuring our motive power production, supply chain and general operations in EMEA to improve efficiencies. 
Operating earnings decreased $1.1 million or 1.6% and decreased $6.9 million or 5.1% in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 80 basis points and 120 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase in commodity costs and freight, partially offset by organic volume improvement, price recoveries and cost saving initiatives. 
The Americas segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, decreased 50 basis points and 180 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher commodity costs, partially offset by organic volume improvement, price recoveries and cost saving initiatives. 
The EMEA segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, decreased 220 basis points and 50 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher commodity costs and freight, partially offset by organic volume improvement and cost saving initiatives. 
The Asia segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, decreased 190 basis points and 230 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a decrease in organic volume from a slow down in telecom spending during the six months of fiscal 2019 in the People's Republic of China and higher commodity costs.
The decrease in interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to lower average debt and the repayment of our high interest debt in South America, offset by higher interest rates. The increase in interest expense in the six months of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower average debt. Our average debt outstanding was $628.3 million and $619.8 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019 compared to $680.5 million and $654.5 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018. 
Included in interest expense are non-cash charges for deferred financing fees of $0.3 million and $0.6 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019 compared to $0.6 million and $1.0 million, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018.
Other (income) expense, net in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was income of $1.3 million compared to expense of $2.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Other (income) expense, net in the six months of fiscal 2019 was income of $0.9 million compared to expense of $6.1 million in the six months of fiscal 2018. Foreign currency impact resulted in a gain of $1.8 million and $2.2 million, in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to a foreign currency loss of $2.5 million and $5.1 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018, respectively. 
The adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)” in fiscal 2019 resulted in pension expense components other than service, being recorded in Other (income) expense, net. These amounted to $0.3 million and $0.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively, and were $0.6 million and $0.8 million in the six months of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
As a result of the above, earnings before income taxes in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $3.1 million, or 5.8%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and decreased $0.6 million or 0.4%, in the six months of fiscal 2019, compared to the six months of fiscal 2018. 
The consolidated effective income tax rates were 18.6% and 21.7%, respectively, for the second quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018 and were 19.1% and 21.2% for the six months of fiscal 2019 and 2018. The rate decrease in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2018 is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and items related to the Tax Act. The Tax Act items accounted for a net decrease of 2.2% comprising a 4.5% decrease for the rate change, a 0.5% decrease for the FDII deduction and a 2.8% increase for GILTI inclusion.
The Company issued performance condition-based awards in the second quarter ended September 30, 2018. The fair value of performance condition based awards are recognized as compensation expense beginning at the time in which the performance conditions are deemed probable of achievement, which the Company assesses at each reporting period. Once a performance condition is considered probable, the Company records compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that award, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining requisite service period using the straight method as the awards are subject to cliff vesting. See Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, for further information.
Operating activities provided cash of $84.0 million in the six months of fiscal 2019 compared to $45.5 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2018. In the six months of fiscal 2019, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $93.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $27.3 million, stock-based compensation of $9.1 million, non-cash charges relating to write-off of assets of $1.1 million, non-cash interest of $0.6 million and provision for deferred taxes of $0.8 million. Cash provided by earnings as adjusted for non-cash items were partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $22.3 million, net of currency translation changes, and an outflow of $4.2 million relating to prepaid assets and $20.6 million relating to accrued expenses for income tax payments. 
In the six months of fiscal 2018, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $91.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $26.6 million, stock-based compensation of $9.5 million, provision of doubtful accounts of $0.8 million and non-cash interest of $1.0 million. Cash provided by earnings as adjusted for non-cash items was partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $46.8 million, net of currency translation changes, decrease in accrued expenses of $32.4 million, comprising primarily of legal proceedings related payments, payroll related expenses and income taxes and an increase in prepaid and other current assets of $5.4 million, comprising primarily of prepaid taxes.
As explained in the discussion of our use of “non-GAAP financial measures,” we monitor the level and percentage of primary working capital to sales. Primary working capital for this purpose is trade accounts receivable, plus inventories, minus trade accounts payable. The resulting net amount is divided by the trailing three month net sales (annualized) to derive a primary working capital percentage. Primary working capital was $666.0 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 25.2%) at September 30, 2018, $701.6 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 25.7%) at March 31, 2018 and $690.2 million at October 1, 2017 (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 28.0%). The primary working capital percentage of 25.2% at September 30, 2018 is 50 basis points lower than that for March 31, 2018, and 280 basis points lower than that for the prior year period. Excluding the impact of certain reclasses relating to the adoption of ASC 606, primary working capital percentage was 26.0%, which is 30 basis points higher than that for March 31, 2018 and 200 basis points lower than that for the prior year period. The increase in primary working capital from March 31, 2018 is primarily due to inventories, on account of rising commodity costs and freight, and a longer supply chain on select products. The decrease in primary working capital from the prior year quarter of October 1, 2017 was due to increased annualized sales, as well as improvements in all three components of primary working capital.
Investing activities used cash of $35.3 million in the six months of fiscal 2019 and primarily consisted of capital expenditures relating to plant improvements.
Investing activities used cash of $29.4 million in the six months of fiscal 2018 and primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $26.6 million, and a $3.0 million acquisition.
Currency translation had a negative impact of $32.5 million on our cash balance in the six months of fiscal 2019 compared to a positive impact of $32.0 million in the six months of fiscal 2018. In the six months of fiscal 2019, principal currencies in which we do business such as the Euro, Swiss franc, British pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi and Mexican peso weakened versus the U.S. dollar. 
As a result of the above, total cash and cash equivalents increased by $23.1 million to $545.2 million, in the six months of fiscal 2019 compared to an increase by $39.8 million to $540.1 million, in the comparable period of fiscal 2018.
