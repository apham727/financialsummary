On December 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Alpha Technologies Services, Inc. (“ATS”) and Alpha Technologies Ltd. (“ATL”), resulting in ATS and ATL becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “share purchase”). Additionally, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Alpha Technologies Inc. and certain assets of Altair Advanced Industries, Inc. and other affiliates of ATS and ATL (all such sellers, together with ATS and ATL, “Alpha”), in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain restructuring agreements (collectively, the “asset acquisition” and together with the share purchase, the “acquisition”). Based in Bellingham, Washington, Alpha is a global industry leader in the comprehensive commercial-grade energy solutions for broadband, telecom, renewable, industrial and traffic customers around the world. The initial purchase consideration for the acquisition was $750.0 million of which $650.0 million was paid in cash and the balance was settled by issuing 1,177,630 shares of EnerSys common stock. These shares were issued out of the Company's treasury stock and were valued at $84.92 per share, which was based on the thirty-day volume weighted average stock price of the Company’s common stock at closing, in accordance with the purchase agreement. The 1,177,630 shares had a closing date fair value of $93.3 million, based upon the December 7, 2018 closing date spot rate of $79.20. The total purchase consideration, consisting of cash paid of $650.0 million, shares valued at $93.3 million and adjustment for working capital (due from seller of $0.8 million) was $742.5 million.
 The results of operations of Alpha have been included in the Company’s Americas segment.
Recent indicators continue to suggest a mixed trend in economic activity among the different geographical regions. North America's experiencing moderate economic growth while EMEA's economic growth is slow. Our Asia region continues to grow faster than any other region in which we do business.
We believe that our financial position is strong, and we have substantial liquidity with $262 million of available cash and cash equivalents and available and undrawn credit lines of approximately $568 million at June 30, 2019 to cover short-term liquidity requirements and anticipated growth in the foreseeable future.
In fiscal 2018, we entered into a new credit facility (“2017 Credit Facility”) that consisted of a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2022. In fiscal 2019, we amended the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the “Amended Credit Facility”). The Amended Credit Facility consists of $449.1 million senior secured term loans (the “Amended 2017 Term Loan”), including a CAD 133.0 million ($99.1 million) term loan and a $700.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Amended 2017 Revolver”). The amendment resulted in an increase of the 2017 Term Loan and the 2017 Revolver by $299.1 million and $100.0 million, respectively.
We believe that our strong capital structure and liquidity affords us access to capital for future acquisition and stock repurchase opportunities and continued dividend payments.
Net sales increased $109.3 million or 16.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This increase was the result of a 22% increase due to the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 3% decrease in organic volume, a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% decrease in pricing. 
The Americas segment’s net sales increased $124.6 million or 31.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 39% increase from the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 6% decrease in organic volume and a combined 1% decrease in pricing and foreign currency translation impact. 
The EMEA segment’s net sales decreased $7.3 million or 3.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 5% decrease due to foreign currency translation impact and a 2% decrease in pricing, partially offset by a 3% increase in organic volume. 
The Asia segment’s net sales decreased $8.0 million or 11.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 8% decrease in organic volume and a 4% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. 
Net sales of our reserve power products in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $111.8 million or 34.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to a 47% increase from the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 10% decrease in organic volume and a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. The decrease in organic volume is primarily from the reclassification of sales made to Alpha as intercompany rather than external sales, in the prior year quarter, and the conclusion of a large enclosure order a year ago. 
Gross profit increased $36.2 million or 21.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased 120 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This increase during the current quarter in the gross profit margin is largely a function of commodity costs relative to pricing, as well the impact of Alpha's higher margins, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.
Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 190 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of the foreign currency translation, the increase in dollars reflects the inclusion of Alpha and the additional investments in new product development.
Included in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 operating results are restructuring charges of $0.6 million in the Americas, $0.6 million in EMEA and $0.5 million in Asia, all of which relate to improving operational efficiencies in the respective regions. Also included in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 operating results are non-cash exit charges of $0.7 million in EMEA, relating to the closure of our facility in Targovishte, Bulgaria. 
Included in our first quarter of fiscal 2019 operating results are restructuring charges of $1.2 million in EMEA and $0.6 million in Asia. The charges in the EMEA relate to improving efficiencies of our general operations, while charges in Asia relate to a strategic shift in our India operations from reserve power production to motive power production.
Operating earnings increased $4.1 million or 6.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 70 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The EMEA segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring and other exit charges, decreased 50 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. EMEA suffered from a decrease in pricing and unfavorable mix.
The Asia segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, decreased 110 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 due to lower organic volume. 
The increase in interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average debt. Our average debt outstanding was $1,052.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $612.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increased borrowings were primarily to fund the Alpha acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Included in interest expense are non-cash charges for deferred financing fees of $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $0.3 million, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Other (income) expense, net in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was income of $1.2 million compared to expense of $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Foreign currency impact resulted in a gain of $1.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to a foreign currency gain of $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
As a result of the above, earnings before income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $1.3 million, or 2.2%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The consolidated effective income tax rates for the first quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 17.0% and 19.7%, respectively. The rate decrease in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. 
Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 64% for fiscal 2020 compared to 66% for fiscal 2019. The foreign effective income tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 11.5% and 11.8%, respectively. The rate decrease compared to the prior year period is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Income from the Company's Swiss subsidiary comprised a substantial portion of our overall foreign mix of income and is taxed at an effective income tax rate of approximately 6% in both the current and prior year quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019.
Report. The adoption of ASC 842 did not result in a material change to our current critical accounting estimates. See Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, for further information on the adoption of ASC 842. 
Operating activities provided cash of $30.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $25.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $48.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $20.7 million, stock-based compensation of $3.9 million and non-cash interest of $0.4 million. Cash provided by earnings as adjusted for non-cash items were partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $23.6 million, net of currency translation changes. Accrued expenses decreased by $16.3 million primarily for payments of $7.3 million related to the German competition authority matter (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) and $6.1 million paid to the seller in connection with the Alpha acquisition, for certain reimbursable pre-acquisition items.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $46.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $13.7 million, stock-based compensation of $4.3 million, non-cash charges relating to write-off of assets of $1.1 million, non-cash interest of $0.3 million and provision for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million. Cash provided by earnings as adjusted for non-cash items were partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $26.6 million, net of currency translation changes, and a decrease in accrued expenses of $13.5 million, comprising primarily of incentives, interest, freight and professional services fees. 
As explained in the discussion of our use of “non-GAAP financial measures,” we monitor the level and percentage of primary working capital to sales. Primary working capital for this purpose is trade accounts receivable, plus inventories, minus trade accounts payable. The resulting net amount is divided by the trailing three month net sales (annualized) to derive a primary working capital percentage. Primary working capital was $838.6 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 26.9%) at June 30, 2019, $835.6 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 26.2%) at March 31, 2019 and $672.6 million at July 1, 2018 (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 25.1%). The primary working capital percentage of 26.9% at June 30, 2019 is 70 basis points higher than that for March 31, 2019, and 180 basis points higher than that for the prior year period. The increase in primary working capital compared to the prior year period is primarily due to the inclusion of the Alpha primary working capital components, while the increase from March 31, 2019 is due primarily to the build up of inventories. 
Investing activities used cash of $15.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and primarily consisted of capital expenditures.
Financing activities provided cash of $8.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we borrowed $64.0 million under the 2017 Revolver and repaid $54.5 million. Payment of cash dividends to our stockholders were $7.3 million and payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards were $3.5 million. Proceeds from stock options were $6.8 million and net borrowings on short-term debt were $3.0 million. 
Currency translation had a positive impact of $1.5 million on our cash balance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to a negative impact of $28.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, principal currencies in which we do business such as the Euro, Swiss franc, Polish zloty and Mexican peso strengthened versus the U.S. dollar. 
As a result of the above, total cash and cash equivalents decreased by $37.1 million to $262.1 million, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to a decrease by $9.6 million to $512.5 million, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
All obligations under our Amended Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, substantially all of our U.S. assets. The Amended Credit Facility contains various covenants which, absent prepayment in full of the indebtedness and other obligations, or the receipt of waivers, limit our ability to conduct certain specified business transactions, buy or sell assets out of the ordinary course of business, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends and take certain other actions. There are no prepayment penalties on loans under this credit facility.
Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
