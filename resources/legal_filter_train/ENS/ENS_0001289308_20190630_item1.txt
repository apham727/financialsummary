There was no cumulative effect of adopting the standard at the date of initial application in retained earnings.
The Company's revenues by reportable segments are presented in Note 17.
Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation.
Control for these services passes to the customer as the services are performed.
Service revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $60,718 and $35,482, respectively.
A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require the bundling of both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definition for a distinct performance obligation.
These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin.
For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement.
Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production.

The Company leases manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, office space, vehicles and other equipment under non-cancellable leases with initial terms typically ranging from 1 to 17 years.
Guidance in Topic 842 is used to evaluate whether the contract has an identified asset; if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset; and if it has the right to direct the use of the underlying asset.
When determining if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset, the Company considers the primary outputs of the identified asset throughout the period of use and determines if it receives greater than 90% of those benefits.
When determining if it has the right to direct the use of an underlying asset, the Company considers if it has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use and if it controls the decision-making rights over the asset.
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease.
The Company exercises its judgment to determine the term of those leases when extension or termination options are present and include such options in the calculation of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options.
The Company has elected to include both lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease payments for all asset classes.
Payments made to a lessor for items such as taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, or other costs commonly referred to as executory costs, are also included in lease payments if they are fixed.
The fixed portion of these payments are included in the calculation of the lease liability, while any variable portion would be recognized as variable lease expenses, when incurred.
Variable payments made to third parties for these, or similar costs, such as utilities, are not included in the calculation of lease payments.
Both finance and operating leases are reflected as liabilities on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term.
As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company has exercised judgment in electing the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available when the lease commences to determine the present value of future payments.
Right-of-use assets are valued at the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs or rent prepayments and reduced by any lease incentives and any deferred lease payments.
Finance lease expense includes depreciation, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the leased asset, and interest expense, which is recognized following an effective interest rate method.
