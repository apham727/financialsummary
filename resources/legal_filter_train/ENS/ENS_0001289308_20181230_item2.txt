On December 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Alpha Technologies Services, Inc. (“ATS”) and Alpha Technologies Ltd. (“ATL”), resulting in ATS and ATL becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “share purchase”). Additionally, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Alpha Technologies Inc. and certain assets of Altair Advanced Industries, Inc. and other affiliates of ATS and ATL (all such sellers, together with ATS and ATL, “Alpha”), in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain restructuring agreements (collectively, the “asset acquisition” and together with the share purchase, the “acquisition”). Based in Bellingham, Washington, Alpha is a global industry leader in the comprehensive commercial-grade energy solutions for broadband, telecom, renewable, industrial and traffic customers around the world. The aggregate purchase consideration for the acquisition was $750.0 million, of which $650.0 million was paid in cash and the balance was settled by issuing 1,177,630 shares of EnerSys common stock. These shares were issued out of the Company's treasury stock and were valued at $84.92 per share, which was based on the thirty-day volume weighted average stock price of the Company’s common stock at closing. The Company funded the cash portion of the acquisition with borrowings from the Amended Credit Facility (as defined in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section).
The results of operations of Alpha have been included in the Company’s Americas segment beginning December 8, 2018. 
Recent indicators continue to suggest a mixed trend in economic activity among the different geographical regions. North America and EMEA are experiencing moderate economic growth. Our Asia region continues to grow faster than any other region in which we do business.
We believe that our financial position is strong, and we have substantial liquidity with $397 million of available cash and cash equivalents and available and undrawn credit lines of approximately $505 million at December 30, 2018 to cover short-term liquidity requirements and anticipated growth in the foreseeable future.
In fiscal 2018, we entered into a new credit facility (“2017 Credit Facility”) that comprised a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2022. On December 7, 2018, we amended the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the “Amended Credit Facility”). The Amended Credit Facility consists of $449.1 million senior secured term loans (the “Amended 2017 Term Loan”), including a CAD 133.0 million ($99.1 million) term loan and a $700.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Amended 2017 Revolver”). The amendment resulted in an increase of the 2017 Term Loan and the 2017 Revolver by $299.1 million and $100.0 million, respectively.
A substantial majority of the Company’s cash and investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. The majority of that cash and investments is expected to be utilized to fund local operating activities, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions. The Company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic and foreign liquidity.
We believe that our strong capital structure and liquidity affords us access to capital for future capital expenditures, acquisition and stock repurchase opportunities and continued dividend payments.
Net sales increased $21.1 million or 3.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. This increase was the result of a 4% increase due to revenues from acquisitions and a 2% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 3% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. 
Net sales increased $112.6 million or 5.9% in the nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the nine months of fiscal 2018. This increase was the result of a 4% increase in organic volume, a 2% increase in pricing and a 1% increase in revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. 
The Americas segment’s net sales increased $48.8 million or 13.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 8% increase in revenues from acquisitions, 5% increase in organic volume and a 3% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. Net sales increased $133.8 million or 12.8% in the nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the nine months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 9% increase in organic volume and a 3% increase each in pricing and acquisitions, partially offset by a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. 
The EMEA segment’s net sales decreased $7.1 million or 3.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 5% decrease in foreign currency translation impact, partially offset by a 2% increase in organic volume. Net sales increased $10.4 million or 1.7% in the nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the nine months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 3% increase in organic volume partially offset by a 1% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. 
The Asia segment’s net sales decreased $20.6 million or 25.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 23% decrease in organic volume and a 4% decrease in foreign currency translation impact partially offset by a 2% increase in pricing. Net sales decreased $31.6 million or 13.9% in the nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the nine months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 14% decrease in organic volume and a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact partially offset by a 2% increase in pricing. 
Net sales of our reserve power products in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $2.5 million or 0.8% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to an 8% increase in acquisitions and a 2% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 6% decrease in organic volume and a 3% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. Net sales increased $42.5 million or 4.6% in the nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the nine months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 3% increase in acquisitions, a 2% increase in pricing and a 1% increase in organic volume, partially offset by a 1% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. 
Net sales of our motive power products in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by $18.6 million or 5.6% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to a 7% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 3% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. Net sales increased $70.1 million or 7.2% in the nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to the nine months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 6% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 1% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. 
Gross profit decreased $2.6 million or 1.7% in the third quarter and decreased $0.2 million or 0.1% in the nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2018. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 120 basis points and 150 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively. This decrease in the gross profit margin in both the third quarter and nine months is primarily due to an increase in commodity costs of approximately $10 million and $40 million, respectively, which were more than offset by increases in organic volume and pricing, but still resulted in gross margin dilution.
Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 180 basis points and 40 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of the foreign currency translation, the increase in dollars was primarily due to payroll related expenses and the Alpha acquisition related costs. 
The Company has taken and is contemplating additional meaningful restructuring actions in EMEA with the intent to improve profitability and streamline management’s focus. With the recent Alpha acquisition, the Company has commenced making restructuring changes as part of its targeted synergy plans.
Included in our third quarter of fiscal 2019 operating results are restructuring charges of $0.6 million in Americas, $4.4 million in EMEA and $0.4 million in Asia. The charges in the Americas relate to improving efficiencies of our general operations. Of the $4.4 million charges in EMEA, $0.9 million relate to improving efficiencies of our general operations and $3.5 million relate to the sale of 100% of the shares in GAZ Geräte- und Akkumulatorenwerk Zwickau GmbH, a wholly-owned German subsidiary. The transaction is planned to close on March 31, 2019, pending fulfillment of certain conditions contained in the sale and purchase agreement. The exit is a consequence of the Company's strategic decision to streamline its product portfolio and focus its efforts on new technologies. The charges in Asia primarily relate to improving efficiencies in the People's Republic of China. 
In fiscal 2009, the Court of Commerce in Lyon, France ruled that the Company’s French subsidiary, EnerSys Sarl, which was acquired by the Company in 2002, was partially responsible for a 1999 fire in a French hotel under construction. The Company’s portion of damages was assessed at €2.7 million, or $4.2 million, which was duly recorded and paid by the Company, but the ruling was appealed. In a subsequent ruling by the Court of Appeal of Lyon, France, the Company's portion of damages was reduced, entitling the Company to a refund of the monies paid of €0.7 million, or $0.9 million, which was recorded and collected in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. The Company further appealed the ruling to the French Supreme Court, which on March 14, 2012, ruled in the Company’s favor and ordered the case back to the Court of Appeal of Lyon to further review certain aspects of the original decision in the case, including the assessment of damages. The Court of Appeal of Lyon heard arguments on April 9, 2013 and ruled in the Company’s favor on June 11, 2013, entitling the Company to a refund of the monies paid of €2.0 million, or $2.8 million. One of the parties to the litigation that is adverse to the Company appealed this ruling to the French Supreme Court which appeal was denied in January 2015. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company and the adverse party settled this final item with the Company receiving a refund, including interest, from the adverse party of €2.5 million, or $2.8 million, for monies paid. The Company believes that it has no further liability with respect to this matter.
Operating earnings decreased $18.7 million or 27.4% and decreased $25.6 million or 12.6% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 320 basis points and 190 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase in commodity costs, freight, tariffs and or other duties, partially offset by organic volume improvement, price recoveries and cost saving initiatives. 
The Americas segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, decreased 280 basis points and 220 basis points, in the third quarter and nine months, respectively. The decrease in the third quarter is primarily due to the impact of the Alpha transaction. Operating earnings were also impacted by net pricing gains exceeding commodity, freight and tariff cost increases. The decrease in the nine months of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to higher commodity costs, partially offset by organic volume improvement, price recoveries and cost saving initiatives. 
The EMEA segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, decreased 260 basis points and 120 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher commodity costs and freight, partially offset by organic volume improvement and cost saving initiatives. 
The Asia segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, decreased 310 basis points and 240 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a decrease in organic volume from a slow down in telecom spending during the nine months of fiscal 2019 in the People's Republic of China and a general softening of demand in Australia as well as higher commodity costs.
Included in interest expense were non-cash charges for deferred financing fees of $0.3 million and $0.9 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to $0.3 million and $1.3 million, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018.
Other (income) expense, net in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.0 million compared to income of $0.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Other (income) expense, net in the nine months of fiscal 2019 was income of $0.9 million compared to expense of $5.8 million in the nine months of fiscal 2018. Foreign currency impact resulted in a gain of $1.0 million and $3.2 million, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, compared to a foreign currency gain of $0.7 million and a loss of $4.4 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively. 
The adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)” in fiscal 2019 resulted in pension expense components other than service, being recorded in Other (income) expense, net. These amounted to $0.3 million in both the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, and were $0.9 million and $1.1 million in the nine months of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
As a result of the above, earnings before income taxes in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $19.6 million, or 31.4%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and decreased $20.2 million or 11.2%, in the nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the nine months of fiscal 2018. 
The consolidated effective income tax rates were (13.3)% and 141.2%, respectively, for the third quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018 and were 10.4% and 63.2% for the nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018. The rate decrease in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2018 is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and items related to the Tax Act. 
The Company issued performance condition-based awards in the third quarter ended December 30, 2018. The fair value of performance condition based awards are recognized as compensation expense beginning at the time in which the performance conditions are deemed probable of achievement, which the Company assesses at each reporting period. Once a performance condition is considered probable, the Company records compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that award, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining requisite service period using the straight method as the awards are subject to cliff vesting. See Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, for further information.
Operating activities provided cash of $166.4 million in the nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to $129.9 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2018. In the nine months of fiscal 2019, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $142.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $42.5 million, stock-based compensation of $14.6 million, non-cash charges relating to write-off of assets of $4.5 million and non-cash interest of $0.9 million. Cash provided by earnings as adjusted for non-cash items were partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $15.2 million, net of currency translation changes, and an outflow primarily related to taxes of $12.5 million in prepaid assets and $23.5 million in other liabilities. Accrued expenses provided a source of funds of $14.3 million primarily relating to acquisition costs and payroll and incentives. 
In the nine months of fiscal 2018, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $65.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $40.3 million, stock-based compensation of $14.8 million, deferred taxes benefit of $7.2 million, non-cash interest of $1.3 million and provision for doubtful accounts of $0.8 million. Cash provided by earnings as adjusted for non-cash items was improved by an increase of $89.2 million in long term liabilities primarily due to the one-time transition tax liability on account of the Tax Act and was partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $42.0 million, net of currency translation changes, and a decrease in accrued expenses of $30.5 million, comprising primarily of legal proceedings related payments, payroll related expenses and income taxes.
As explained in the discussion of our use of “non-GAAP financial measures,” we monitor the level and percentage of primary working capital to sales. Primary working capital for this purpose is trade accounts receivable, plus inventories, minus trade accounts payable. The resulting net amount is divided by the trailing three month net sales (annualized) to derive a primary working capital percentage. Primary working capital was $827.8 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 24.9%) at December 30, 2018, $701.6 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 25.7%) at March 31, 2018 and $689.6 million at December 31, 2017 (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 26.2%). The primary working capital percentage of 24.9% at December 30, 2018 is 80 basis points lower than that for March 31, 2018, and 130 basis points lower than that for the prior year period. Excluding the impact of certain reclasses relating to the adoption of ASC 606, primary working capital percentage was 25.5%, which is 20 basis points lower than that for March 31, 2018 and 70 basis points lower than that for the prior year period. The increase in primary working capital is primarily due to the inclusion of the Alpha primary working capital components. 
Investing activities used cash of $702.1 million in the nine months of fiscal 2019 which primarily consisted of $650.0 million paid towards the Alpha acquisition and $52.7 million of capital expenditures relating to plant improvements.
Investing activities used cash of $45.7 million in the nine months of fiscal 2018 and primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $43.1 million and a $3.0 million acquisition.
Financing activities provided cash of $451.2 million in the nine months of fiscal 2019. During the nine months of fiscal 2019, we borrowed $454.5 million under the Amended 2017 Revolver and $299.1 million under the Amended 2017 Term Loan, primarily to fund the Alpha acquisition and repaid $246.0 million of the Amended 2017 Revolver. Treasury stock open market purchases were $25.0 million, payment of cash dividends to our stockholders were $22.3 million and payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards were $3.4 million. Proceeds from stock options were $9.0 million and net payments on short-term debt were $13.6 million. 
Currency translation had a negative impact of $40.5 million on our cash balance in the nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to a positive impact of $38.3 million in the nine months of fiscal 2018. In the nine months of fiscal 2019, principal currencies in which we do business such as the Euro, Swiss franc, British pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi and Mexican peso weakened versus the U.S. dollar. 
As a result of the above, total cash and cash equivalents decreased by $125.0 million to $397.2 million, in the nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to an increase by $71.0 million to $571.3 million, in the comparable period of fiscal 2018.
All obligations under our Amended Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, substantially all of our U.S. assets. The Amended Credit Facility contains various covenants which, absent prepayment in full of the indebtedness and other obligations, or the receipt of waivers, limit our ability to conduct certain specified business transactions, buy or sell assets out of the ordinary course of business, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends and take certain other actions. There are no prepayment penalties on loans under this credit facility.
A table of our obligations is contained in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations of our 2018 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2018. On December 7, 2018, the Company amended its existing 2017 Credit Facility to fund the Alpha acquisition. The Amended Credit Facility consists of $449.1 million senior secured term loans, including a CAD 133.0 million ($99.1 million) term loan and a $700.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The amendment resulted in an increase of the 2017 Term Loan and the 2017 Revolver by $299.1 million and $100.0 million, respectively. 
Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
The following table summarizes the number of shares of common stock we purchased from participants in our equity incentive plans as well as repurchases of common stock authorized by the Board of Directors. As provided by the Company’s equity incentive plans, (a) vested options outstanding may be exercised through surrender to the Company of option shares or vested options outstanding under the Company’s equity incentive plans to satisfy the applicable aggregate exercise price (and any withholding tax) required to be paid upon such exercise and (b) the withholding tax requirements related to the vesting and settlement of restricted stock units and market condition-based share units may be satisfied by the surrender of shares of the Company’s common stock.
