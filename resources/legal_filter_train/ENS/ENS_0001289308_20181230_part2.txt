Item 1A.Risk Factors
Expected combination benefits from the Transaction may not be fully-realized or realized within the expected time frame. 
The ability of Alpha and EnerSys to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to combine Alpha’s and our businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies, and achieves the projected stand-alone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company. It is expected that we will benefit from operational and general and administrative cost synergies resulting from the warehouse and transportation integration, direct procurement savings on overlapping materials, purchasing scale on indirect spend categories and optimization of duplicate positions and processes. We may also enjoy revenue synergies, driven by a strong portfolio of brands with exposure to higher growth segments and the ability to leverage our collective distribution strength. In order to achieve these expected benefits, we must successfully combine the businesses of Alpha and EnerSys in a manner that permits these cost savings and synergies to be realized and must achieve the anticipated savings and synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If we experience difficulties with the integration process or are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.
referred to as “Brexit”). In March 2017, the UK government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union,
commencing a period of up to two years for the United Kingdom and the other EU member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal. The British government and the European Union have now negotiated a withdrawal agreement, and the European Union has approved that agreement, but the British Parliament has not yet approved it. As a result, there remains considerable uncertainty around the withdrawal. Failure to obtain parliamentary approval of the negotiated withdrawal agreement would mean that the United Kingdom would leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, probably with no agreement (a so-called "hard Brexit"). The consequences for the economies of the European Union members and of the United Kingdom exiting the European Union are unknown and unpredictable, especially in the case of a hard Brexit. Depending on the final terms of Brexit, we could face new regulatory costs and challenges and greater volatility in the Pound Sterling and the euro. Any adjustments we make to our business and operations as of Brexit could result in significant time and expense to complete. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
