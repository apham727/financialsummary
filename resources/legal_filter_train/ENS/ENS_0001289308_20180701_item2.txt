Recent indicators continue to suggest a mixed trend in economic activity among the different geographical regions. North America and EMEA are experiencing moderate economic growth. Our Asia region continues to grow faster than any other region in which we do business.
We believe that our financial position is strong, and we have substantial liquidity with $513 million of available cash and cash equivalents and available and undrawn credit lines of approximately $540 million at July 1, 2018 to cover short-term liquidity requirements and anticipated growth in the foreseeable future.
In fiscal 2018, we entered into a new credit facility (“2017 Credit Facility”) that comprises a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2022 provides us with sufficient liquidity to fund acquisitions and stock repurchase programs.

Net sales increased $48.3 million or 7.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This increase was the result of a 5% increase in organic volume, a 2% increase in pricing and a 1% increase in foreign currency translation impact. 
The Americas segment’s net sales increased $37.9 million or 10.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 9% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in pricing. 
The EMEA segment’s net sales increased $11.4 million or 5.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 4% increase due to foreign currency translation impact and a 2% increase in pricing. 
The Asia segment’s net sales decreased $1.0 million or 1.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 7% decrease in organic volume partially offset by a 4% increase in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% increase in pricing. 
Net sales of our reserve power products in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $18.8 million or 6.2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to a 4% increase in organic volume and a 1% increase each in pricing and foreign currency translation impact. 
Net sales of our motive power products in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by $29.5 million or 9.3% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to a 5% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase each in pricing and foreign currency translation impact.
Gross profit increased $1.8 million or 1.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 160 basis points in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively. This decrease in the gross profit margin in the first quarter is primarily due to an increase in commodity costs of approximately $16 million partially offset by an increase in organic volume and pricing.
Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, increased $6.6 million but decreased as a percentage of net sales by 10 basis points. Excluding this impact of the foreign currency translation, the increase in dollars was primarily due to payroll related expenses. 
Included in our first quarter of fiscal 2019 operating results are restructuring charges of $1.2 million in EMEA and $0.6 million in Asia. The charges in the EMEA relate to improving efficiencies of our general operations, while charges in Asia relate to a strategic shift in our India operations from reserve power production to motive power production. 
Included in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 operating results are $0.8 million relating to restructuring charges in EMEA consisting of cash charges primarily relating to severance.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, in an effort to improve profitability, we converted our India operations from being mainly reserve power production to motive power production. As a result of our exit from reserve power, we recorded a non-cash write off of reserve power inventories of $0.5 million, which was reported in cost of goods sold. In addition, we wrote off reserve power fixed assets of $0.6 million, which was recorded in restructuring expenses.
Operating earnings decreased $5.8 million or 8.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 170 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. primarily due to an increase in lead cost, partially offset by organic volume improvement, price recoveries and cost saving initiatives. 
The Americas segment's operating earnings decreased 300 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher commodity costs partially offset by organic volume improvement, price recoveries and cost saving initiatives. 
Operating earnings decreased 250 basis points in the Asia segment in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a decrease in organic volume from a slow down in telecom spending during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in the People's Republic of China, as well as higher commodity costs, partially offset by price recoveries.
The increase in interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to higher interest rates compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Our average debt outstanding was $612.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $630.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Included in interest expense are non-cash charges for deferred financing fees of $0.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Other (income) expense, net in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was expense of $0.4 million compared to expense of $3.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Foreign currency impact resulted in a gain of $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a foreign 
currency loss of $2.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)” in fiscal 2019 resulted in pension expense components other than service, being recorded in Other (income) expense, net. These amounted to $0.3 million and $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
As a result of the above, earnings before income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $3.7 million, or 6.0%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. 
The consolidated effective income tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 19.7% and 20.7%, respectively. The rate decrease in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and items related to the Tax Act. The Tax Act items accounted for a net decrease of 2.6% comprised of a 4.8% decrease for the rate change, a 0.5% decrease for the FDII deduction and a 2.7% increase for GILTI inclusion.
Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 66% for fiscal 2019 compared to 69% for fiscal 2018. The foreign effective income tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 11.8% and 11.6%, respectively. The rate increase compared to the prior year period is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Income from the Company's Swiss subsidiary comprised a substantial portion of our overall foreign mix of income and is taxed at an effective income tax rate of approximately 6%.
Operating activities provided cash of $25.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $21.6 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2018. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $46.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $13.7 million, stock-based compensation of $4.3 million, non-cash charges relating to write-off of assets of $1.1 million, non-cash interest of $0.3 million and provision for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million. Cash provided by earnings as adjusted for non-cash items were partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $26.6 million, net of currency translation changes, and a decrease in accrued expenses of $13.5 million, comprising primarily of incentives, interest, freight and professional services fees. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $48.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $13.2 million, stock-based compensation of $5.2 million, provision of doubtful accounts of $0.5 million and non-cash interest of $0.3 million. Cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $25.5 million, net of currency translation changes, accrued expenses of $15.2 million, comprising primarily of payroll related expenses and income taxes and prepaid and other current assets of $4.2 million, comprising primarily of prepaid taxes.
As explained in the discussion of our use of “non-GAAP financial measures,” we monitor the level and percentage of primary working capital to sales. Primary working capital for this purpose is trade accounts receivable, plus inventories, minus trade accounts payable. The resulting net amount is divided by the trailing three month net sales (annualized) to derive a primary working capital percentage. Primary working capital was $672.6 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 25.1%) at July 1, 2018, $701.6 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 25.7%) at March 31, 2018 and $661.9 million at July 2, 2017 (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 26.6%). The primary working capital percentage of 25.1% at July 1, 2018 is 60 basis points lower than that for March 31, 2018, and 150 basis points lower than that for the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and certain reclasses relating to the adoption of ASC 606, inventory levels increased compared to inventory at March 31, 2018. The reason for the increase in inventory is partially due to rising lead costs and a longer supply chain on select products.

Currency translation had a negative impact of $28.2 million on our cash balance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a positive impact of $19.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, principal currencies in which we do business such as the Euro, Swiss franc, British pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi and Mexican peso weakened versus the U.S. dollar. 
All obligations under our 2017 Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, substantially all of our U.S. assets.
