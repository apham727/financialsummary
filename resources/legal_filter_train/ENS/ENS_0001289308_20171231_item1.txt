The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K (SEC File No. 001-32253), which was filed on May 30, 2017 (the “2017 Annual Report”).
The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” providing guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB voted to delay the effective date for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permissible one year earlier. The standard permits the use of either modified retrospective or full retrospective transition methods. The Company has substantially completed an impact assessment of the potential changes from adopting ASU 2014-09. The impact assessment included a review of customer arrangements across all of its global business units and an in-depth analysis of its global revenue processes and accounting policies to identify potential areas where change may be needed to comply with this guidance. The Company plans to apply the modified retrospective transition method. The Company assembled an implementation work team to assess and document the accounting conclusions for the adoption of ASU 2014-09. Based on this analysis, the Company does not believe the adoption of the ASU will have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to assess the potential impact on accounting policies, internal control processes and related disclosures required under the new guidance.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)”, which requires an entity to report the service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the same line item as other compensation costs. The other components of net (benefit) cost will be required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 
15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.
The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2017 Annual Report.
The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.
The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities. 
The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the new 2017 Credit Facility and the previous 2011 Credit Facility (each as defined in Note 9), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2.
The Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), with an original face value of $300,000, were issued in April 2015. The fair value of these Notes represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2. The Notes were trading at approximately 104% and 101% of face value on December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. 
The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases. Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. At December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 54.0 million pounds and 45.0 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $60,849 and $46,550, respectively.
The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had entered into a total of $52,801 and $30,751, respectively, of such contracts.
In all cases, the Company may adjust these provisional amounts which could potentially affect the measurement and impact on tax expense as the Company refines its calculations within a reasonable period not to exceed one year from the enactment date.
7. Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation
In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of environmental, anticompetition, employment, contract and other laws. In some of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by federal, state, local and foreign agencies, the Company and its subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders for documents, testimony and 
information in connection with various aspects of their activities.
Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants. 
In June 2017, the Company settled a portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company's motive power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $14,811, which was paid in July 2017. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $13,463, respectively, relating to this matter. Also in June 2017, the German competition authority issued a fining decision related to the Company's reserve power battery business, which constitutes the remaining portion of the previously disclosed German proceeding. The Company is appealing this decision, including payment of the proposed fine of $11,415, and believes that the reserve power matter does not, based on current facts and circumstances known to management, require an accrual. The Company is not required to escrow any portion of this fine during the appeal process.
In July 2017, the Company settled the Dutch regulatory proceeding and agreed to pay a fine of $11,229, which was paid in August 2017. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $10,258, respectively, relating to the Dutch regulatory proceeding.
As a result of its operations, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local, as well as international environmental laws and regulations and is exposed to the costs and risks of registering, handling, processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of hazardous substances, especially lead and acid. The Company’s operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international occupational safety and health regulations, including laws and regulations relating to exposure to lead in the workplace. 
To stabilize its lead costs and reduce volatility from currency movements, the Company enters into contracts with financial institutions. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. Please refer to Note 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more details.

12. Stockholders’ Equity and Noncontrolling Interests
During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with a major financial institution to repurchase up to $100,000 of its common stock. The Company prepaid $100,000 and received an initial delivery of 1,278,976 shares with a fair market value of approximately $80,000. The ASR is accounted for as a treasury stock repurchase, reducing the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding by the 1,278,976 shares initially received, and as a forward contract indexed to the Company's own common shares to reflect the future settlement provisions. Because the maximum repurchase will be $100,000, as of December 31, 2017, $20,000 representing the difference between the fair value of shares delivered and the maximum notional amount of $100,000, is accounted for as an equity instrument and is included in additional paid-in capital. The ASR is not accounted for as a derivative instrument.
No shares were received pursuant to the ASR during the current quarter. 
On January 9, 2018, the ASR was settled, and the Company received an additional 216,738 shares. See Note 15 - Subsequent Events, for more information.
