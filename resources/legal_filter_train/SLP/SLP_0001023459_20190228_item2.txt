The forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this document are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) and are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
We are a global leader focused on improving the ways scientists use knowledge and data to predict the properties and outcomes of pharmaceutical and biotechnology agents, and are one of only two global companies who provide a wide range of early discovery, preclinical, and clinical consulting services and software.
Our innovations in integrating new and existing science in medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, pharmaceutical science, biology, physiology, and machine learning into our software have made us the leading software provider for PBPK modeling and simulation, prediction of molecular properties from structure, and prediction of drugs to induce liver injury or to treat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
We generate revenue by delivering relevant, cost-effective software and creative and insightful consulting services.
Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies use our software programs and scientific consulting services to guide early drug discovery (molecule design and screening), preclinical, and clinical development programs.
They also use it to enhance their understanding of the properties of potential new medicines and to use emerging data to improve formulations, select and justify dosing regimens, support the generics industry, optimize clinical trial designs, and simulate outcomes in special populations, such as the elderly and pediatric patients.
Simulations Plus previously acquired Cognigen Corporation (Cognigen) as a wholly owned subsidiary.
Through the integration of Cognigen into Simulations Plus, Simulations Plus became also a leading provider of population modeling and simulation contract research services for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
Our clinical-pharmacology-based consulting services include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, clinical trial simulations, data programming, and technical writing services in support of regulatory submissions.
We have also developed software for harnessing cloud-based computing in support of modeling and simulation activities and secure data archiving, and we provide consulting services to improve interdisciplinary collaborations and research and development productivity.
Simulation Plus also acquired DILIsym Services, Inc. (DILIsym) as a wholly owned subsidiary.
Both the DILIsym and NAFLDsym software programs require outputs from physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) software as inputs.
Our flagship product, originally introduced in 1998, and currently our largest single source of software revenue, is GastroPlus.
GastroPlus mechanistically simulates the absorption, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug-drug interactions of compounds administered to humans and animals and is currently the most widely used commercial software of its type by pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other government agencies in the U.S. and other countries.
Because of the widespread use of GastroPlus, we were the only non-European company invited to join the European Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) program for Oral Bioavailability Tools (OrBiTo).
Because we are outside of the European Union, our participation in this project was at our own expense, while other members were compensated for their work; however, we were a full member with access to all of the data and discussions of all other members.
We believe our investment to participate in this initiative enabled us to benefit from, and to contribute to, advancing the prediction of human oral bioavailability from preclinical data, and ensured that we are well-known to member pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies.
In September 2014, we entered into a research collaboration agreement (RCA) with the FDA to enhance the Ocular Compartmental Absorption and Transit (OCAT™) model within the Additional Dosing Routes Module of GastroPlus.
The objective of this agreement was to provide a tool for generic companies and the FDA to assess the likely bioequivalence of generic drug formulations dosed to the eye.
Under this RCA, we received up to $200,000 per year.
This RCA could be renewed for up to a total of three years based on the progress achieved during the project.
After a successful second year, the RCA was extended for two additional years in September 2016, with primary tasks completed in September 2018.
Additional functionality was further requested by the FDA, and a new funded contract was awarded for the 2018-19 period.
In September 2018, we were pleased to announce that we were awarded another funded RCA by the FDA to integrate drug product quality attributes into the mechanistic TCAT model in GastroPlus.
This grant award, for $250,000 per year for up to two years, will focus on the incorporation of drug product quality attributes into dermal physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models developed for dermatological topical dosage forms and transdermal delivery systems.
This project will contribute substantially to improvements in the program, specifically directed toward the predictions of local exposure within the skin layer following topical administration of various chemicals.
We expect the developments under this agreement will aid companies and regulatory agencies as they strive to implement an animal-free chemical safety assessment program.
In January 2019 DILIsym Services and Simulations Plus entered into a two-year, $2.7 million collaboration with a large pharmaceutical company on the development of a new Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) model that will provide the ability to predict the efficacy of drugs being developed to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
Part of this funding will go towards expansion of GastroPlus to improve the predictions of compound exposure upon inhalation of drugs.
In addition to the two active funded efforts with the FDA described above, we also have an unfunded RCA with the FDA’s Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) that began in 2014.
Our goal with GastroPlus is to integrate the most advanced science into user-friendly software to enable researchers and regulators to perform sophisticated analyses of complex compound behaviors in humans and laboratory animals.
Already the most widely used program in the world for PBPK modeling, the addition of these new capabilities is expected to expand the user base in the early pharmaceutical research and development process, while also helping us to further penetrate biopharmaceuticals, food, cosmetics, and general toxicology markets.
Version 9.7 is now in development and release is expected in early 2019.
This version will add a number of important new capabilities, including improvements to population simulations, dissolution, absorption, PBPK models, and drug-drug interactions, among others.
DDDPlus mechanistically simulates in vitro (laboratory) experiments that measure the rate of dissolution of a drug as well as, if desired, the additives (excipients) in a particular dosage form (e.g., powder, tablet, capsule, or injectable solids) under a variety of experimental conditions.
This unique software program is used by formulation scientists in industry and the FDA to (1) understand the physical mechanisms affecting the disintegration and dissolution rates of various formulations, (2) reduce the number of cut-and-try attempts to design new drug formulations, (3) design in vitro dissolution experiments to better mimic in vivo (animal and human) conditions, and (4) .
This version added new formulation types (controlled release bilayer tablet, delayed release coated tablet, and immediate release coated beads), expanded formulation specification options, biorelevant solubilities and surfactant effects on dissolution, tablet compression and disintegration models, links with GastroPlus, and updated licensing.
Similar to DDDPlus, MembranePlus mechanistically simulates laboratory experiments, but in this case, the experiments are for measuring permeability of drug-like molecules through various membranes, including several different standard cell cultures (Caco-2, MDCK), as well as artificially formulated membranes (PAMPA).
These differences are caused by a complex interplay of factors in how the experiment was set up and run.
MembranePlus simulates these experiments with their specific experimental details, and this enables scientists to better interpret how results from specific experimental protocols can be used to predict permeability in human and animals, which is the ultimate goal.
In August 2016, we released a standalone software product called PKPlus, based on the internal PKPlus Module in GastroPlus that has been available since 2000.
doses; however, the PKPlus Module in GastroPlus was not designed to meet all of the requirements for performing these analyses for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, nor to produce report-quality output for regulatory submissions.
The standalone PKPlus program provides the full level of functionality needed by pharmaceutical industry scientists to perform the analyses and generate the outputs needed to fully satisfy regulatory agency requirements for both more complex NCA as well as compartmental PK modeling.
After receiving considerable feedback on version 1.0, we began modifying the program to include a number of additional features requested by our users and potential users for release in version 2.0.
ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) Predictor is a chemistry-based computer program that takes molecular structures (i.e., drawings of molecules represented in various formats) as inputs and predicts approximately 150 different properties for them at an average rate of over 100,000 compounds per hour on a modern laptop computer.
This capability allows chemists to generate estimates for a large number of important molecular properties without the need to synthesize and test the molecules, as well as to generate estimates of unknown properties for molecules that have been synthesized, but for which only a limited number of experimental properties have been measured.
Thus, a chemist can assess the likely success of a large number of existing molecules in a company’s chemical library, as well as molecules that have never been made, by providing only their molecular structures, either by drawing them using a tool such as our MedChem Designer software, or by automatically generating large numbers of molecules using various computer algorithms, including those embedded in our MedChem Studio software.
Although the state of the art of this type of software does not enable identifying the best molecule in a series, it does allow early screening of molecules that are highly likely to fail as potential drug candidates (i.e., the worst molecules, which is typically the majority of a virtual chemical library) before synthesizing and testing them.
Thus, millions of virtual compounds can be created and screened in a day, compared to potentially months or years of work to actually synthesize and test a much smaller number of actual compounds.
MedChem Designer was initially a molecule-drawing program, or “sketcher”, but now has capabilities far exceeding those of other molecule-drawing programs because of its integration with both MedChem Studio and ADMET Predictor.
Our free version includes a small set of ADMET Predictor’s best-in-class property predictions, allowing the chemist to modify molecular structures and then see a few key properties very quickly.
With a paid ADMET Predictor license, the chemist would see the entire approximately 150 predictions that are available.
When used with a license for ADMET Predictor, MedChem Designer becomes a de novo molecule design tool.
With it, a researcher can draw one or more molecular structures, then click on the ADMET Predictor icon and have approximately 150 properties for each structure calculated in seconds, including our proprietary ADMET Risk™ index.
Researchers can also click on an icon to generate the likely metabolites of a molecule and then predict all of the properties of those metabolites from ADMET Predictor, including each of their ADMET Risk scores.
This is important because a metabolite of a molecule can be therapeutically beneficial (or harmful) even though the parent molecule is not.
The ideal score is zero; however, a low score greater than zero might be acceptable, depending on what property(s) caused the points to be assigned.
If the number is too high (greater than 7), the molecule is not likely to be successful as a drug.
The default rules can be modified, and new rules can be added by the user to include any desired set based on combinations of calculated molecular descriptors, predicted properties, and user inputs.
As chemists attempt to modify structures to improve one property, they often cause others to become unacceptable.
Without ADMET Risk, the chemist would have to individually examine many key properties for each new molecule (and its metabolites) to determine whether any of them became unacceptable as a result of changing the structure.
The MedChem Studio Module in ADMET Predictor is a powerful software tool that is used both for data mining and for de novo design of new molecules.
In its data-mining role, MedChem Studio facilitates searching large chemical libraries to find molecules that contain identified substructures, and it enables rapid identification of clusters (classes) of molecules that share common substructures.
Drug development programs rely increasingly on modeling and simulation analyses to support decision-making and submissions to regulatory agencies.
To ensure high-quality analyses, organizations must not only apply high-quality science, but must also be able to support the science by being able to validate the results.
KIWI is a cloud-based web application that was developed to efficiently organize, process, maintain, and communicate the volume of data and results generated by pharmacologists and scientists over the duration of a drug development program.
The validated workflow and tools within KIWI promote traceability and reproducibility of results.
The pharmaceutical industry has been rapidly adopting cloud technology as a solution to ever-expanding computer processing needs.
Leveraging our 20-plus years of experience in providing an architecture supporting modeling and simulation efforts, we have developed KIWI as a secure, validated, enterprise-scale environment, enabling global teams to collaborate on model-based decision making.
KIWI has proven to be a valuable platform for encouraging interdisciplinary discussions about the model development process and interpretation of results.
We continue to receive positive feedback about the functionality implemented in KIWI and the value of the approach we have taken to harness cloud technology.
KIWI Version 1.3 was released in May 2015.
These features included dynamic comparisons of model parameter estimates and diagnostic plots, export of model run records for regulatory submissions, and accelerated infrastructure with the upgrade to the latest versions of NONMEM® and Perl-speaks-NONMEM running in a 64-bit Linux environment.
In addition, analysts could now conveniently copy visualization preferences across projects, improving consistency and facilitating collaboration and communication with clients and colleagues.
In addition, since it can take hundreds of models to create one final model, an automated diagnostics dashboard has been added that visually displays the results of over 10 diagnostics that are used by modelers to decide what direction to take their modeling with the potential to significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to arrive at a final model.
The latest version incorporates ExploreLive and Explore, two powerful new visualization modules, introduced for exploratory data analysis of information stored in analysis datasets and NONMEM outputs.
In addition, new automated diagnostics are now performed for every NONMEM run, visually reported in the Summarize module.
KIWI version 3.0 also features improved infrastructure and security, as well as a completely redesigned Knowledge Portal used to access the KIWI program.
In addition to full feature releases, going forward regular mini feature releases of KIWI will be distributed to KIWI clients.
In 2019 Q1, an enhanced editor and grouping of visualizations for easy replication was added, resulting in streamlined model development.
We continue enhancing KIWI as part of our five-year, almost-$5 million contract with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
QSP software models are based on the fundamental understanding of complex biological pathways, disease processes, and drug mechanisms of action, integrating information from experiments and forming hypotheses for the next experimental model.
DILIsym deals with the propensity for some drug molecules to induce temporary or permanent changes in biological functions within liver cells (hepatocytes) that can result in damage to the liver.
Some drugs cause temporary changes in liver function but the body soon compensates and liver function returns to normal.
Other drugs cause liver function to permanently decline as they continue to be taken.
The DILIsym software models a variety of interactions within the hepatocytes to determine whether a particular drug molecule interrupts normal signaling pathways in a manner to induce injury to the cells.
Where DILIsym is used to investigate the likelihood that a known drug molecule would cause injury to the liver, RENAsym will be focused on investigating and predicting drug-induced kidney injury, or acute kidney injury (AKI).
The software will utilize predictions of drug exposure in the kidney from PBPK platforms such as GastroPlus, along with in vitro data related to certain kidney injury mechanisms, to make predictions.
The first expected release of RENAsym will be available in Fall of 2020.
The initial development is being funded via an NIH small business grant.
To date, we have developed products internally, sometimes also licensing or acquiring products, or portions of products, from third parties.
These arrangements sometimes require that we pay royalties to third parties.
We currently have one license agreement, with Dassault Systèmes Americas Corp. (formerly known as Accelrys, Inc.), a San Diego division of Dassault Systemes in France, pursuant to which a small royalty is paid to Dassault Systèmes Americas Corp. from revenues on each license for the Metabolism Module in ADMET Predictor.
On May 15, 2014, we and TSRL entered into a termination and nonassertion agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the 1997 exclusive software licensing agreement.
All payments were made as of April 2017.
The total consideration is being amortized at a constant rate of $150,000 per quarter until it is completely amortized, after which no further expense will be incurred.
To date, this has resulted in expense savings over $1,500,000 compared to the royalty payments that would have been paid to TSRL if paid consistent with past practices.
We distribute our products and offer our services in North America, South America, Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, India, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, and the People’s Republic of China.
We market our pharmaceutical software and consulting services through attendance and presentations at scientific meetings, exhibits at trade shows, seminars at pharmaceutical companies and government agencies, through our website, and using various communication channels to our database of prospects and customers.
At various scientific meetings around the world each year there are numerous presentations and posters presented in which the reported research was performed using our software.
Many of these presentations are from industry and FDA scientists; some are from our staff.
In addition, more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific journal articles, posters, and podium presentations are typically published each year using our software, mostly by our customers, further supporting its use in a wide range of preclinical and clinical studies.
We provide support to the GastroPlus User Group in Japan, which was organized by Japanese researchers in 2009.
We support this group through coordination of online meetings each month and managing the user group web site for exchange of information among members.
These user groups provide us valuable feedback with respect to desired new features and suggested interface changes.
Our pharmaceutical software products are designed and developed by our development teams in California, North Carolina (Research Triangle Park), and New York (Buffalo), we also employee people who are able to work remotely using collaboration software.
Our products and services are now delivered electronically – we no longer provide CD-ROMs and printed manuals or reports.
Major pharmaceutical companies conduct drug discovery and development efforts through their internal development staffs and through outsourcing.
Smaller companies generally need to outsource a greater percentage of this research.
Thus, we compete not only with other software suppliers and scientific consulting service providers, but also with the in-house development and scientific consulting teams at some of the larger pharmaceutical companies.
In addition, we actively seek strategic acquisitions to expand the pharmaceutical software and services business.
