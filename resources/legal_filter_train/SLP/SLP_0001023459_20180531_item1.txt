Simulations Plus, Inc.
This report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 31, 2018, should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on November 14, 2017.
As contemplated by the SEC under Article 3 of Regulation S-X, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been condensed and therefore do not contain all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles.
The interim financial data are unaudited; however, in the opinion of Simulations Plus, Inc. ("we", "our", "us"), the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those to be expected for the full year.
On September 2, 2014, Simulations Plus, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Cognigen Corporation (“Cognigen”, “Buffalo”) and Cognigen became a wholly owned subsidiary of Simulations Plus, Inc. Simulations Plus, Inc., acquired DILIsym Services, Inc. (DILIsym) as a wholly owned subsidiary pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated May 1, 2017.
On June 1, 2017, the Company consummated the acquisition of all outstanding equity interests of DILIsym pursuant to the terms of the Stock Agreement, with DILIsym becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
The Company designs and develops pharmaceutical simulation software to promote cost-effective solutions to a number of problems in pharmaceutical research and in the education of pharmacy and medical students, and it provides consulting services to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.
Recently, the Company has begun to explore developing software applications for defense and for health care outside of the pharmaceutical industry.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Simulations Plus, Inc. and, as of September 2, 2014 and June 1, 2017, respectively, its wholly owned subsidiaries, Cognigen Corporation and DILIsym Services, Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies.
Significant accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, accounting for capitalized computer software development costs, valuation of stock options, and accounting for income taxes.
Certain numbers in the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.
As a byproduct of ongoing improvements and upgrades for the new programs and new modules of software, some modifications are provided to our customers who have already purchased software at no additional charge.
Other software modifications result in new, additional-cost modules that expand the functionality of the software.
These are licensed separately.
The Company provides, for a fee, additional training and service calls to its customers and recognizes revenue at the time the training or service call is provided.
Generally, we enter into one-year license agreements with customers for the use of our pharmaceutical software products.
We recognize revenue on these contracts when all the criteria are met.
Therefore, revenue is recognized one year at a time.
Certain of the Company's software products are housed and supported on the Company's computer networks.
Software revenues for those products are included in income over the life of the contract.
We recognize revenue on sales of our DILIsym subsidiary in accordance with ASC 605-25, “Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements”.
Our multiple-deliverable arrangements consist of consulting arrangements at our DILIsym subsidiary.
We allocate the revenue derived from these arrangements among all the deliverables.
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Accounts receivable are written off when all collection attempts have failed.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs is calculated on a product-by-product basis using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the products (not to exceed five years).
Amortization of software development costs amounted to $331,862 and $290,567 for the three months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $952,894 and $864,443 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Company performs valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair value.
Acquired intangible assets include customer relationships, software, trade names, and noncompete agreements.
The Company determines the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on historical experience of the acquired businesses.
Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the majority of the economic benefits are expected to be consumed.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets.
Goodwill is not amortized, instead it is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances change that would indicate that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment.
As of May 31, 2018, the Company determined that it has three reporting units, Simulations Plus, Cognigen Corporation, and DILIsym Services, Inc.
The Company is required to perform step one only if it concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value.
Should this be the case, the first step of the two-step process is to identify whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units with their respective book values, including goodwill.
If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired, and no additional steps are necessary.
If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
The amount of the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its implied fair value.
If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
As of May 31, 2018, the entire balance of goodwill was attributed to two of the Company's reporting units, Cognigen Corporation and DILIsym Services.
Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.
There were no changes to goodwill, nor has the Company recognized any impairment charges, during the three-month periods ended May 31, 2018 and 2017.
The Company accounted for the acquisition of Cognigen and DILIsym Services, Inc., using the purchase method of accounting where the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized based on their respective estimated fair values.
The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Determining the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the selection of appropriate valuation methodology, projected revenue, expenses and cash flows, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, estimates of advertiser and publisher turnover rates, and estimates of terminal values.
As of May 31, 2018, and August 31, 2017, the Company has a liability for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of the DILIsym Services, Inc.
The fair value of contingent consideration obligations is based on a discounted cash flow model using a probability-weighted income approach.
These fair-value measurements represent Level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market.
Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.
Changes in the value of the contingent consideration obligations are recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The following is a reconciliation of contingent consideration value.
These costs include salaries, laboratory experiment, and purchased software that was developed by other companies and incorporated into, or used in the development of, our final products.
On February 28, 2012, we bought out a royalty agreement with Enslein Research of Rochester, New York.
The cost of $75,000 is being amortized over 10 years under the straight-line method.
Amortization expense for each of the three-month periods ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1,875, and was $5,625 for each of the nine-month periods ended May 31, 2018, and 2017.
Accumulated amortization as of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017 were $46,875 and $41,250, respectively.
On May 15, 2014, we entered into a termination and nonassertion agreement with TSRL, Inc., pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate an exclusive software licensing agreement entered into between the parties in 1997.
We agreed to pay TSRL total consideration of $6,000,000, which is being amortized over 10 years under the straight-line method.
Amortization expense for each of the three-month periods ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 was $150,000, and $450,000 for each of the nine-month periods ended May 31, 2018 and 2017.
Accumulated amortization as of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017 were $2,425,000 and $1,975,000, respectively.
On June 1, 2017, as part of the acquisition of DILIsym Services, Inc. the Company acquired certain developed technologies associated with drug induced liver disease (DILI).
These technologies were valued at $2,850,000 and are being amortized over 9 years under the straight-line method.
Amortization expense for the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018 was $79,176 and $237,500, respectively, and is included in cost of revenues.
Accumulated amortization as of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017 was $316,667 and $79,176, respectively.
Total amortization expense for intellectual property agreements for the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 was $231,042 and $151,875, respectively, and total amortization expense for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 was $693,125 and $455,625 respectively.
Accumulated amortization as of May 31, 2018 was $2,788,542 and $2,095,417 as of August 31, 2017.
Amortization expense for each of the three-month and nine-month periods ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 was $89,375 and $36,875, and $268,125 and $110,625, respectively.
According to policy, in addition to normal amortization, these assets are tested for impairment as needed.
The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other” and ASC 360, “Property and Equipment”.
We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the expected future undiscounted net cash flows generated by the asset.
If we determine that the asset may not be recoverable, or if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge to the extent of the difference between the fair value and the asset's carrying amount.
No impairment losses were recorded during the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017.
The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the Franchise Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09).
The standard will eliminate the transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) and replace it with a principles-based approach for determining revenue recognition.
The revenue recognition standard is required to be applied retrospectively, including any combination of practical expedients as allowed in the standard.
The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends certain aspects of the Board's new revenue standard, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The Company has commenced its assessment of these new standards, developed a project plan to guide the implementation, and is evaluating the impact these new standards will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In the second and third quarters, the company executed a project to evaluate the impact of these changes, which included a review of existing contracts with customers, an evaluation of the specific terms of those contracts and the appropriate treatment under the new standards, and a comparison of that new treatment to the Company’s existing accounting policies, to identify differences.
The standard can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
The Company has not yet determined if it plans to utilize the full retrospective or modified retrospective method of adoption.
In the fourth quarter the Company will complete its analysis, draft disclosures, and calculate any transition adjustment, if required, once the analysis is complete.
The Company believes that it is following an appropriate timeline to allow for proper adoption on the implementation date of September 1, 2018.
The company will continue to monitor new customer contracts until the transition date.
On June 1, 2017, the Company acquired DILIsym Services, Inc.
The agreement provided for a working capital adjustment, an eighteen-month $1,000,000 holdback provision against certain representations and warrantees, and an Earn-out agreement of up to an additional $5,000,000 in Earn-out payments based on earnings over the next three years.
The Earn-out liability has been recorded at an estimated fair value.
Payments under the Earn-out liability will be due starting in FY 2019.
It is estimated that approximately 38% of the Earn-out liability as well as the holdback will be paid in 2019 and the majority of the remaining Earn-out will be paid in the following year.
We lease approximately 13,500 square feet of space in Lancaster, California.
The original lease had a five-year term with two, three-year options to extend.
The initial five-year term expired in February 2011, and we extended the lease to February 2, 2014.
In May 2016 the Company exercised the two, two-year options extending the term of the lease through February 2, 2021 at a fixed rate of $25,000 per month.
The new extension agreement allowed the Company with 90 days’ notice to opt out of the remaining lease in the last two years of the term upon payment of a recapture payment equal to the 3% base payment increase that would have been due under the original agreement.
Our Buffalo subsidiary leases approximately 12,623 square feet of space in Buffalo, New York.
The initial five-year term expires in October 2018; the lease allows for a three-year option to extend to October 2021.
In September 2017 DILIsym signed a three-year lease for approximately 1,900 rentable square feet of space in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
Prior to this lease DILIsym was on a month-to-month rental.
Rent expense, including common area maintenance fees for the three months ended May 31, 2018, and 2017 was $144,589 and $128,011, respectively, and $424,077 and $375,564 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In the normal course of business, the Company has entered into employment agreements with certain of its key management personnel that may require compensation payments upon termination.
Such guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
We are not a party to any legal proceedings and are not aware of any pending legal proceedings of any kind.
