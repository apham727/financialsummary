As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.92 million and $6.22 million, respectively.
Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held in money market accounts; however, they are not exposed to market rate risk.
In the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, we sold $921,000 and $721,000, and $1,572,000 and $1,274,000, respectively, of software through representatives in certain Asian markets in local currencies.
The value of these receivables are subject to changes because the receivables may become worth more or less due to changes in currency exchange rates.
The majority of our software license agreements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
We base these changes on market conditions while working closely with our representatives.
We do not hedge currencies or enter into derivative contracts.
