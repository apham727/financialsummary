As of November 30, 2018 and August 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.35 million and $9.40 million, respectively.
Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held in money market accounts; however, they are not exposed to market rate risk.
In the three months ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, we sold $809,000 and $670,000, respectively of software through representatives in certain Asian markets in local currencies.
These transactions give rise to receivables that are denominated in currencies other than the entityâ€™s functional currency.
The value of these receivables are subject to changes because the receivables may become worth more or less due to changes in currency exchange rates.
The majority of our software license agreements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
We base these changes on market conditions while working closely with our representatives.
We do not hedge currencies or enter into derivative contracts.
None.
