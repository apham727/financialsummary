Revenues primarily consist of sales of air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration equipment, and related parts and supplies.
Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal.
Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons.
In 2009, we formed a joint venture with Carrier Corporation (“Carrier”), which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, in which Carrier contributed 95 of its company-owned locations in 13 Sun Belt states and Puerto Rico, and its export division in Miami, Florida, and we contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products.
Collectively, the Northeast locations and the Mexico operations are referred to as Carrier Enterprise II.
We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and Carrier has a 20% non-controlling interest.
Homans previously operated as a division of Carrier Enterprise II and now operates as one of our stand-alone-subsidiaries.
In 2012, we formed a third joint venture, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, referred to as UTC Canada, an affiliate of Carrier.

In the following narratives, computations and other information referring to “same-store basis” exclude the effects of locations closed, acquired, or locations opened, unless they are within close geographical proximity to existing locations, during the immediately preceding 12 months.
At September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, 10 and 8 locations opened were near existing locations and were therefore included in “same-store basis” information.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2019 increased $98.9 million, or 8%, including $58.7 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $4.2 million from locations closed.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 decreased to 15.3% versus 15.5% for the same period in 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses included $1.5 million of additional costs for 2019 in excess of 2018 for ongoing technology initiatives, driven in part by our acquisition of Alert Labs in August 2018.
On a same-store basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were flat as compared to the same period in 2018.
Other income of $3.5 million and $3.7 million for the third quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, represented our share of the net income of RSI.
Interest expense, net for the third quarter of 2019 increased $0.4 million, or 37%, primarily as a result of increase in average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate due to higher interest income for the 2019 period, as compared to the same period in 2018.
The effective income tax rates attributable to us were 22.2% and 23.3% for the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Income taxes decreased to $60.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $63.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and represent a composite of the income taxes attributable to our wholly owned operations and income taxes attributable to the Carrier joint ventures, which are primarily taxed as partnerships for income tax purposes; therefore, Carrier is responsible for its proportionate share of income taxes attributable to its share of earnings from these joint ventures.
The effective income tax rates attributable to us were 22.1% and 23.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively.
The decrease was primarily due to lower estimated foreign withholding taxes and the refinement of estimated GILTI of foreign subsidiaries in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 due to the finalization of federal and state income tax regulations.

non-controlling interest related to our purchase of the additional 20% interest in Homans, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and interest expense as discussed above.
the timing and extent of common stock repurchases.
We rely on cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including dividend payments (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and development of our long-term operating and technology strategies.
As of September 30, 2019, we had $60.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $43.9 million was held by foreign subsidiaries.
We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future.
However, there can be no assurance that our current sources of available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements.
Our access to funds under our revolving credit agreement depends on the ability of the syndicate banks to meet their respective funding commitments.
Disruptions in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit agreement and may also adversely affect the determination of interest rates, particularly rates based on LIBOR, which is one of the base rates under our revolving credit agreement.
Working capital increased to $1,148.5 million at September 30, 2019 from $1,084.2 million at December 31, 2018, reflecting higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories, primarily due to new locations opened and acquired, as well as additional inventory acquired in anticipation of the transition to new energy conservation standards for residential furnace fans that became effective on July 3, 2019.
These increases were partially offset by the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities as well as the current portion of lease liabilities recognized as current liabilities as a result of the adoption of the New Lease Standard on January 1, 2019.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the comparative timing of payments for accrued expenses and other current liabilities in 2019 versus 2018.
Net cash used in investing activities was higher primarily due to cash consideration paid for those acquisitions described above.
The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to lower net proceeds under our revolving credit agreement, the purchase of an additional 20% ownership interest in Homans for $32.4 million and an increase in dividends paid, partially offset by $17.0 million in proceeds from the
non-controlling interest for their contribution to the acquisition of the HVAC distribution business of PPI in 2019.
We maintain an unsecured, $500.0 million syndicated multicurrency revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit.
The credit facility has a seasonal component from October 1 to March 31, during which the borrowing capacity was reduced to $400.0 million at our discretion.
The credit agreement matures on December 5, 2023.
We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2019.
Homans previously operated as a division of Carrier Enterprise II and subsequent to the purchase operates as a stand-alone subsidiary of the Company with 16 locations in the Northeastern U.S.
On June 21, 2017, Carrier Enterprise I acquired a 34.9% ownership interest in RSI, an HVAC distributor operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. for cash consideration of $63.6 million, of which we contributed $50.9 million, and Carrier contributed $12.7 million.
Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% ownership interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise I’s ownership interest in RSI to 36.3%.
Pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement, RSI’s shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI.
At September 30, 2019, the estimated purchase amount we would be contingently liable for was approximately $131.0 million.
We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to purchase any additional ownership interests in RSI.
On April 2, 2019, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of DASCO, a distributor of air conditioning and heating products operating from seven locations in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.
The purchase price was composed of cash consideration of $16.8 million and the issuance of 50,952 shares of Common stock having a fair value of $7.5 million.
On August 1, 2019, Carrier Enterprise I acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of PPI, an HVAC distributor operating from 19 locations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, for $85 million less certain average revolving indebtedness.
Consideration for the net purchase price consisted of $10.0 million in cash, 372,543 shares of Common stock having a fair value of $58.6 million and the payment of certain average revolving indebtedness.
Carrier contributed cash of $17.0 million to Carrier Enterprise I in connection with the acquisition of PPI.
Any acquired goodwill as a result of this acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.
