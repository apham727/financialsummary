10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Revenues primarily consist of sales of air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration equipment, and related parts and supplies.
Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal.
Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons.
In 2009, we formed a joint venture with Carrier Corporation (“Carrier”), which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, in which Carrier contributed 95 of its company-owned locations in 13 Sun Belt states and Puerto Rico, and its export division in Miami, Florida, and we contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products.
In 2011, we formed a second joint venture with Carrier and completed two additional transactions.
In April 2011, Carrier contributed 28 of its company-owned locations in the Northeast U.S., and we contributed 14 locations in the Northeast U.S.
Collectively, the Northeast locations and the Mexico operations are referred to as Carrier Enterprise II.
Homans previously operated as a division of Carrier Enterprise II and now operates as one of our stand-alone-subsidiaries.
In 2012, we formed a third joint venture, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, referred to as UTC Canada, an affiliate of Carrier.

In the following narratives, computations and other information referring to “same-store basis” exclude the effects of locations closed, acquired, or locations opened, unless they are within close geographical proximity to existing locations, during the immediately preceding 12 months.
At both June 30, 2019 and 2018, 8 locations opened were near existing locations and were therefore included in “same-store basis” information.
Revenues for the second quarter of 2019 increased $39.1 million, or 3%, including $22.8 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $3.6 million from locations closed.
On a same-store basis, revenues increased $19.9 million, or 1%, as compared to the same period in 2018, reflecting a 3% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (69% of sales), which included a 4% increase in residential HVAC equipment, a 2% decrease in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and a 1% decrease in sales of commercial refrigeration products (3% of sales).
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2019 increased $7.2 million, or 2%, primarily as a result of increased revenues.
non-equipment products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2019 increased $10.0 million, or 5%, primarily due to increased revenues.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 increased to 14.3% versus 14.0% for the same period in 2018.
Excluding new locations opened or acquired during the last 12 months, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million, or 2%.
Other income of $3.0 million and $3.2 million for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, represented our share of the net income of RSI.
Interest expense, net for the second quarter of 2019 increased $0.4 million, or 59%, primarily as a result of an increase in average outstanding borrowings and a higher effective interest rate for the 2019 period, in each case under our revolving credit facility, as compared to the same period in 2018.
The effective income tax rates attributable to us were 21.7% and 23.8% for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decrease was primarily due to lower estimated foreign withholding taxes in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.
Net Income Attributable to Watsco, Inc.
Net income attributable to Watsco for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 increased $0.2 million compared to the same period in 2018.
non-controlling interest related to the purchase of the additional 20% interest in Homans, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and interest expense as discussed above.
Revenues for the first half of 2019 increased $43.8 million, or 2%, including $26.9 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $6.2 million from locations closed.
For residential HVAC equipment, the increase in revenues was primarily due to realization of price increases and a higher mix of high-efficiency air conditioning and heating systems, which sell at higher unit prices, resulting in a 3% increase in the average selling price.
Gross profit for the first half of 2019 increased $10.1 million, or 2%, primarily as a result of increased revenues.
Gross profit margin remained consistent at 24.4% for the first half of 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.

the timing and extent of common stock repurchases.
We rely on cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including dividend payments (to the extent declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and development of our long-term operating and technology strategies.
As of June 30, 2019, we had $55.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $37.7 million was held by foreign subsidiaries.
We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future.
However, there can be no assurance that our current sources of available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements.
Our access to funds under our revolving credit agreement depends on the ability of the syndicate banks to meet their respective funding commitments.
base rates under our revolving credit agreement.
Working capital increased to $1,114.6 million at June 30, 2019 from $1,084.2 million at December 31, 2018, reflecting higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories, primarily due to the seasonality of our business.
Inventory is also higher as a result of new locations opened and acquired, as well as additional inventory received in anticipation of the transition to new energy conservation standards for residential furnace fans that became effective on July 3, 2019.
These increases were partially offset by the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities as well as the current portion of lease liabilities recognized as current liabilities as a result of the adoption of the New Lease Standard on January 1, 2019.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the comparative timing of payments for accrued expenses and other current liabilities in 2019 versus 2018.
Net cash used in investing activities was higher due to cash consideration paid for acquisitions and the purchase of an additional ownership interest in RSI in 2019.
The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to lower net proceeds under our revolving credit agreement, the purchase of an additional 20% ownership interest in Homans for $32.4 million and an increase in dividends paid in 2019.
We maintain an unsecured, $500.0 million syndicated multicurrency revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit.
The credit facility has a seasonal component from October 1 to March 31, during which the borrowing capacity may be reduced to $400.0 million at our discretion (which would effectively reduce fees payable in respect of the unused portion of the commitment).
Included in the credit facility are a $100.0 million swingline subfacility, a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility, a $75.0 million alternative currency borrowing sublimit and an $8.0 million Mexican borrowing sublimit.
The credit agreement matures on December 5, 2023.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $219.6 million and $135.2 million, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement.
We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2019.
Homans previously operated as a division of Carrier Enterprise II and subsequent to the purchase operates as a stand-alone subsidiary of the Company with 16 locations in the Northeastern U.S.
On June 21, 2017, Carrier Enterprise I acquired a 34.9% ownership interest in RSI, an HVAC distributor operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. for cash consideration of $63.6 million, of which we contributed $50.9 million, and Carrier contributed $12.7 million.
Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% ownership interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise I’s ownership interest in RSI to 36.3%.
Total cash consideration of $3.8 million was paid on July 5, 2018, of which we contributed $3.0 million and Carrier contributed $0.8 million.
Carrier Enterprise I is a party to a shareholders agreement (the “Shareholders Agreement”) with RSI and its shareholders.
Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSI’s shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI.
We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to purchase any additional ownership interests in RSI.
On August 1, 2019, Carrier Enterprise I acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Peirce-Phelps, Inc. (“PPI”), an HVAC distributor operating from 19 locations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, for $85.0 million less certain average revolving indebtedness.
Consideration for the net purchase price consisted of $10.0 million in cash and 372,543 shares of Common stock having a fair value of $58.6 million.
Carrier contributed cash of $17.0 million to Carrier Enterprise I in connection with the acquisition of PPI.
Shares repurchased under the program are accounted for using the cost method and result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity.
We last repurchased shares under this plan in 2008.
In aggregate, 6,370,913 shares of Common and Class B common stock have been repurchased at a cost of $114.4 million since the inception of the program.
At June 30, 2019, there were 1,129,087 shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the program.
