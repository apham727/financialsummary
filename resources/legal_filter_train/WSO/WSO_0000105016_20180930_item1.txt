The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal.
Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons.
Demand related to the new construction market is generally evenly distributed throughout the year, subject to weather and economic conditions, including their effect on the number of housing completions.
The excess, if any, of the carrying amount of our investment over our ownership percentage in the underlying net assets of the investee is attributed to certain fair value adjustments with the remaining portion recognized as goodwill.
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the 2018 presentation.
These reclassifications had no effect on net income or earnings per share as previously reported.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued a standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers.
The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized.
In 2015 and 2016, the FASB issued several updates to this standard.
In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.
Most prominent among the changes to the standard is the requirement that changes in the fair value of equity investments, with certain exceptions, be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income.
A cumulative-effect adjustment captured the previously held unrealized losses of $301 related to our equity securities carried at fair value.
In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for hedging derivatives.
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
In July 2018, updated guidance was issued which provides an additional transition method of adoption that allows entities to initially apply the standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
We will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2019 using this additional transition method and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
We are in the process of collecting data and designing processes and controls to account for our leases in accordance with the new guidance.
Our current minimum lease commitments are disclosed in Note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
We adopted the New Revenue Standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.
Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior period results have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
Revenue primarily consists of sales of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies.
We satisfy our performance obligations for services when we render the services within the agreed-upon service period.
Total service revenue is not material and accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated revenues for both the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Revenue is recognized when control transfers to our customers when picked up or via shipment of products or delivery of services.
Revenue for shipping and handling charges is recognized when products are delivered to the customer.
We estimate product returns based on historical experience and record them on a gross basis.
Substantially all customer returns relate to products that are returned under manufacturers warranty obligations.
We estimate sales incentives expected to be paid over the term of the program based on the most likely amounts.
Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction in the transaction price and are generally paid on an annual basis.
We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less.
We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.
We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit.
Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this revolving credit agreement from $600,000 to $300,000.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $116,400 and $21,800, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement.
 borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement are classified as current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet at September 30, 2018.
We believe that we will refinance the credit agreement at or prior to its maturity on similar terms and subject to similar conditions.
We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2018.
On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise Northeast LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, for cash consideration of $42,688, which increased our controlling interest from 70% to 80%.
Carrier Enterprise II was formed in 2011 as a joint venture with Carrier.
Carrier Enterprise II had sales of approximately $545,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 40 locations in the northeastern United States and 14 locations in Mexico.
On June 21, 2017, our first joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise, LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, acquired an approximately 35% ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. (RSI), an HVAC distributor with 2017 sales of approximately $680,000, operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I, and Carrier has a 20% non-controlling interest.
Carrier Enterprise I acquired its ownership interest in RSI for cash consideration of $63,600, of which we contributed $50,880, and Carrier contributed $12,720.
Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% ownership interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI to 36.3%.
Total cash consideration of $3,760 was paid on July 5, 2018, of which we contributed $3,008 and Carrier contributed $752.
Carrier Enterprise I is a party to a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with RSI and its shareholders.
Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI.
Additionally, Carrier Enterprise I has the right to appoint two of RSIs six board members.
Given Carrier Enterprise Is 36.3% ownership interest in RSI and its right to appoint two out of RSIs six board members, this investment in RSI is accounted for under the equity method.
On August 23, 2018, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired Alert Labs Inc., a technology company based in Ontario, Canada for cash consideration of $5,889 and the issuance of 47,103 shares of Common stock, having a fair value of $8,180.
We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the earnings impact that foreign exchange rate fluctuations would otherwise have on certain monetary liabilities that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies.
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges.
The settlement of these derivatives results in reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for the period in which the settlement of these instruments occurs.
The maximum period for which we hedge our cash flow using these instruments is 12 months.
Accordingly, at September 30, 2018, all of our open foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less.
The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at September 30, 2018 was $36,800, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through June 2019.
At September 30, 2018, we expected an estimated $3 pre-tax gain to be reclassified into earnings to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months.
We have also entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are either not designated as hedges or did not qualify for hedge accounting.
These derivative instruments were effective economic hedges for all of the periods presented.
The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments at September 30, 2018 was $12,000, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through November 2018.
We recognized losses of $(108), $(502), $(299) and $(912) from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Equity securities  the investments are exchange-traded equity securities.
Fair values for these investments are based on closing stock prices from active markets and are therefore classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivative financial instruments  these derivatives are foreign currency forward and option contracts.
See Note 9.
Fair value is based on observable market inputs, such as forward rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivatives within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we sold 35,000 shares of Common stock under the ATM Program for net proceeds of $5,391.
At September 30, 2017, $244,560 remained available for sale under the Sales Agreement.
As of December 31, 2017, we had completed the offering of shares under the ATM Program.
The net proceeds were primarily used to repay outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes.
We paid cash dividends of $1.45, $1.25, $4.15 and $3.35 per share of both Common stock and Class B common stock during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we granted 10,000, 9,000, 110,109 and 164,899 shares of non-vested restricted stock, respectively.
During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 8,830, 12,354, 21,754 and 32,454 shares of Common stock, respectively, with aggregate fair market values of $1,562, $1,893, $3,775 and $4,664, respectively, were withheld as payment in lieu of cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of non-vested restricted stock.
These shares were retired upon delivery.
During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 8,600, 9,084, 53,184 and 25,084 stock options, respectively, were exercised for Common stock.
Cash received from common stock issued as a result of stock options exercised during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, was $856, $801, $4,837 and $2,111, respectively.
These shares were retired upon delivery.
During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 2,235, 2,718, 6,716 and 6,977 shares of Common stock, respectively, were issued under our employee stock purchase plan for which we received net proceeds of $382, $402, $1,142 and $1,004, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we issued 17,318 and 16,389 shares of Common stock, respectively, to our profit sharing retirement plan, representing the Common stock discretionary matching contributions of $2,945 and $2,428, respectively.
We are involved in litigation incidental to the operation of our business.
Self-insurance reserves are maintained relative to company-wide casualty insurance and health benefit programs.
The level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop-loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverage.
Management reviews its assumptions with its independent third-party actuaries to evaluate whether the self-insurance reserves are adequate.
If actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occur and exceed these estimates, additional reserves may be required.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, approximately $93,000 and $75,000, respectively, was payable to Carrier and its affiliates, net of receivables.
Our joint ventures with Carrier also sell HVAC products to Carrier and its affiliates.
Revenues in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 included approximately $28,000, $19,000, $65,000 and $51,000, respectively, of sales to Carrier and its affiliates.
We believe these transactions are conducted on terms equivalent to an arms-length basis in the ordinary course of business.
A member of our Board of Directors is the Senior Chairman of Greenberg Traurig, P.A., which serves as our principal outside counsel for compliance and acquisition-related legal services.
