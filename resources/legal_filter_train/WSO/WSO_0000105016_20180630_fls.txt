This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains or incorporates by reference statements that are not historical in nature and that are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Statements which are not historical in nature, including the words anticipate, estimate, could, should, may, plan, seek, expect, believe, intend, target, will, project, focused, outlook, and variations of these words and negatives thereof and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, including statements regarding, among others, (i) economic conditions, (ii) business and acquisition strategies, (iii) potential acquisitions and/or joint ventures and investments in unconsolidated entities, (iv) financing plans and (v) industry, demographic and other trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations.
We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made.
We assume no obligation to update forward-looking information or the discussion of such risks and uncertainties to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as required by applicable law.
