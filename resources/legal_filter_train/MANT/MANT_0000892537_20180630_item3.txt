Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates for borrowing under our revolving credit facility.
At June 30, 2018, we had $29.5 million outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility.
A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates would have a $0.2 million effect on our interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Under this policy, no investment securities can have maturities exceeding six months and the weighted average maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed 60 days.
