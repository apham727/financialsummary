Amounts contained in this Report may not always add to totals due to rounding.
The classification of certain prior-period amounts has been adjusted in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) to conform with current-period classifications.
Reclassifications include certain direct selling and bid and proposal costs from the “Cost of product sales and services” line item to the “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses” line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (Unaudited) and in these Notes.
As discussed above, we adopted ASC 606 effective June 30, 2018.
This standard supersedes nearly all revenue recognition guidance under GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards and supersedes some cost guidance for construction-type and production-type contracts.
The guidance in this standard is principles-based, and, consequently, entities are required to use more judgment and make more estimates than under prior guidance, including identifying contract performance obligations, estimating variable consideration to include in the contract price and allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations.
The core principle of this standard is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
We elected to apply the practical expedient related to backlog disclosures for prior reporting periods and the practical expedient related to evaluating the effects of contract modifications that occurred prior to the earliest period presented.
Retrospective application of this standard resulted in the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment of $15 million to reduce the opening balance of retained earnings at July 2, 2016.
This standard requires, among other things, the recognition of right-of-use assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most lease arrangements and disclosure of certain information about leasing arrangements.
Companies may elect to use the modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements or to initially apply this standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.
This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, which for us is our fiscal 2020.
We have developed a project plan to evaluate the impact of this standard and design and implement future processes, tools and controls.
The majority of our current lease arrangements are classified as operating leases under existing GAAP lease guidance, and we expect they will continue to be classified as operating leases under the new standard.
We have not yet made a decision on the transition method, as this determination is primarily dependent on the completion of our evaluation.
During the two quarters ended December 28, 2018, we had options or other share-based compensation outstanding under two shareholder-approved employee stock incentive plans (“SIPs”), the Harris Corporation 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (As Amended and Restated Effective August 27, 2010) and the Harris Corporation 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2015 EIP”).
Grants of share-based awards after October 23, 2015 were made under our 2015 EIP.
We believe that share-based awards more closely align the interests of participants with those of shareholders.
Certain share-based awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined under our SIPs).
The compensation cost related to our share-based awards that was charged against income was $15 million and $29 million for the quarter and two quarters ended December 28, 2018, respectively, and $13 million and $24 million for the quarter and two quarters ended December 29, 2017, respectively.
Such charges include termination benefits, contract termination costs and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees.
We record these charges at their fair value when incurred.
In cases where employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and will be retained beyond the minimum retention period, we record the expense ratably over the future service period.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $5 million charge for consolidation of certain Exelis Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, “Exelis”) facilities initiated in fiscal 2017.
Accounting Pronouncements” in our Fiscal 2017-2018 Update 8-K for additional information regarding this accounting standards update.
We have a receivables sale agreement (“RSA”) with a third-party financial institution that permits us to sell, on a non-recourse basis, up to $50 million of outstanding receivables at any given time.
From time to time, we have sold certain customer receivables under the RSA, which we continue to service and collect on behalf of the third-party financial institution.
Receivables sold pursuant to the RSA meet the requirements for sales accounting under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, and, accordingly, are derecognized from our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (Unaudited) at the time of sale.
Outstanding accounts receivable sold pursuant to the RSA were not material at December 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018.
Impairment losses related to receivables from contracts with customers were not material during the quarter or two quarters ended December 28, 2018 or the quarter or two quarters ended December 29, 2017.
 Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized exceeding amounts billed to customers for contracts utilizing the percentage of completion (“POC”) cost-to-cost revenue recognition method.
We bill customers as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals, upon achievement of contractual milestones or upon deliveries and, in certain arrangements, the customer may withhold payment of a small portion of the contract price until contract completion.
Contract assets and liabilities are reported on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
Changes in contract assets and contract liabilities balances during the quarter and two quarters ended December 28, 2018 were not materially impacted by any factors other than those described above.
Impairment losses related to our contract assets were not material during the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017.
For the quarter and two quarters ended December 28, 2018, we recognized revenue of $49 million and $207 million, respectively, related to contract liabilities that were outstanding at June 29, 2018.
For the quarter and two quarters ended December 29, 2017, we recognized revenue of $53 million and $163 million, respectively, related to contract liabilities that were outstanding at June 30, 2017.
We also sell extended product warranties and recognize revenue from these arrangements over the warranty period.
Deferred revenue associated with extended product warranties was $16 million at December 28, 2018 and June 29, 2018.
The non-service cost components of net periodic pension income are included in the “Non-operating income” line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (Unaudited).
As a result of this voluntary contribution as well as a $400 million voluntary contribution made during fiscal 2017, we made no contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans during the quarter and two quarters ended December 28, 2018, and we currently anticipate making no contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and minor contributions to a non-U.S. pension plan during the remainder of fiscal 2019.
We made no contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans during the quarter and two quarters ended December 29, 2017.
Salaried Retirement Plan (“U.S.
SRP”), a U.S. qualified pension plan, is our largest defined benefit pension plan, with assets valued at $4.6 billion and a projected benefit obligation of $5.2 billion as of June 29, 2018.
Effective December 31, 2016, accruals under the U.S. SRP benefit formula were frozen for all employees and replaced with a 1% cash balance benefit formula for certain employees who were not highly compensated on December 31, 2016.
Potential dilutive common shares primarily consist of employee stock options and restricted and performance unit awards.
Income from continuing operations per diluted common share excludes the antidilutive impact of 399,243 and 279,705 weighted average share-based awards outstanding for the quarter and two quarters ended December 28, 2018, respectively, and 222 and 81,496 weighted average share-based awards outstanding for the quarter and two quarters ended December 29, 2017, respectively.
Our effective tax rate was 16.5 percent in the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 compared with 34.7 percent in the two quarters ended December 29, 2017.
In addition to the items noted above for the quarters ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, our effective tax rate for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017 benefited from the favorable impact of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation.
•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.
In certain instances, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices obtained from external pricing services.
In obtaining such data from the external pricing services, we have evaluated the methodologies used to develop the estimate of fair value in order to assess whether such valuations are representative of fair value, including net asset value (“NAV”).
Additionally, in certain circumstances, the NAV reported by an asset manager may be adjusted when sufficient evidence indicates NAV is not representative of fair value.
We use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to such risks and formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions.
We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting.
We recognize all derivatives in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (Unaudited) at fair value.
We do not hold or issue derivatives for speculative trading purposes.
At December 28, 2018, we had two open foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $5 million, one of which had a notional amount of $4 million and was classified as a fair value hedge, and the other had a notional amount of $1 million and was classified as a cash flow hedge.
We use foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge certain balance sheet items, including foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and inventory.
At December 28, 2018, we had an outstanding foreign currency forward contract denominated in the Canadian Dollar to hedge a certain balance sheet item.
The net gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts designated as fair value hedges were not material in the quarter or two quarters ended December 28, 2018 or in the quarter or two quarters ended December 29, 2017.
In addition, no amounts were recognized in earnings in the quarter or two quarters ended December 28, 2018 or in the quarter or two quarters ended December 29, 2017 related to hedged firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges.
We use foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments and also have hedged U.S. Dollar payments to suppliers to maintain our anticipated profit margins in our international operations.
 Under the POC cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition, a single estimated profit margin is used to recognize profit for each performance obligation over its period of performance.
Recognition of profit on a contract requires estimates of the total cost at completion and transaction price and the measurement of progress towards completion.
Factors that must be considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, subcontractor performance and the risk and impact of delayed performance.
After establishing the estimated total cost at completion, we follow a standard Estimate at Completion (“EAC”) process in which we review the progress and performance on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently.
If we successfully retire risks associated with the technical, schedule and cost aspects of a contract, we may lower our estimated total cost at completion commensurate with the retirement of these risks.
Conversely, if we are not successful in retiring these risks, we may increase our estimated total cost at completion.
Additionally, as the contract progresses, our estimates of total transaction price may increase or decrease if, for example, we receive award fees that are higher or lower than expected.
When adjustments in estimated total costs at completion or in estimated total transaction price are determined, the related impact on operating income is recognized using the cumulative catch-up method, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of such adjustments for all prior periods.
Any anticipated losses on these contracts are fully recognized in the period in which the losses become evident.
Net EAC adjustments resulting from changes in estimates impacted our operating income favorably by $2 million ($.02 per diluted share) and unfavorably by $1 million for the quarter and two quarters ended December 28, 2018, respectively, and unfavorably by $16 million ($11 million after-tax or $.09 per diluted share) and $11 million ($8 million after-tax or $.06 per diluted share) for the quarter and two quarters ended December 29, 2017, respectively.
Revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was $9 million and $16 million for the quarter and two quarters ended December 28, 2018, respectively, and $16 million and $30 million for the quarter and two quarters ended December 29, 2017, respectively.
Backlog comprises both funded backlog (i.e., firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog.
Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts, such as indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts.
We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue associated with this backlog within the next twelve months and the substantial majority of the revenue associated with this backlog within the next 3 years.
•Space and Intelligence Systems, providing intelligence, space protection, geospatial, complete Earth observation, universe exploration, positioning, navigation and timing (“PNT”), and environmental solutions for national security, defense, civil and commercial customers, using advanced sensors, antennas and payloads, as well as ground processing and information analytics.
Intersegment sales are generally transferred at cost to the buying segment, and the sourcing segment recognizes a profit that is eliminated.
The “Corporate eliminations” line item in the table below represents the elimination of intersegment sales.
corporate expenses not allocated to our business segments and the elimination of intersegment profits.
The “Pension adjustment” line item in the table below represents the reconciliation of the non-service components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, which are a component of segment operating income but are included in the “Non-operating income” line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (Unaudited) as a result of our adoption of ASU 2017-07 as discussed in Note A — Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Standards in these Notes.
The non-service components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of net actuarial gain.
In connection with our pending merger with L3 (see Note S — Pending Merger in these Notes for additional information), two putative class action lawsuits and one individual lawsuit were filed against L3 and its directors (together, the “L3 Parties”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York between December 19, 2018 and January 15, 2019, and a third putative class action lawsuit, Kent v. L3 Technologies, Inc., et al., was filed against the L3 Parties and Harris Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, Leopard Merger Sub Inc. (Harris Corporation and Leopard Merger Sub Inc., the “Harris Parties”), in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 4, 2019.
The complaint in the Kent lawsuit further alleges that the Harris Parties are liable for these violations as “controlling persons” of L3 within the meaning of federal securities laws.
The complaints in all four lawsuits generally seek injunctive relief enjoining the merger, damages and costs, among other remedies.
Additional lawsuits in connection with the merger may be filed in the future.
On October 14, 2018, we announced that on October 12, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with L3 and Leopard Merger Sub Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which we and L3 have agreed to combine in an all-stock merger of equals.
Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, L3 shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 1.30 shares of Harris common stock for each share of L3 common stock.
Upon closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Harris Corporation will be re-named “L3 Harris Technologies, Inc.” and Merger Sub will merge with and into L3, with L3 being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of L3 Harris Technologies, Inc., which will be owned on a fully diluted basis approximately 54 percent by Harris shareholders and 46 percent by L3 shareholders.
Upon closing, the merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and Harris will be treated as the accounting acquirer.
The consummation of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among others, approval by the shareholders of each company and the expiration or earlier termination of any applicable waiting period, and the receipt of approvals under domestic and certain foreign antitrust and competition laws, including the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”).
In connection with the proposed merger, we and L3 each filed a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act (an “HSR Notification”) with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ on November 9, 2018.
We voluntarily withdrew our HSR Notification effective as of December 10, 2018 and re-filed our HSR Notification on December 11, 2018.
As part of the DOJ’s review of the merger, we and L3 each received on January 10, 2019 a request for additional information and documentary materials (the “Second Request”) from the DOJ, which extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after both we and L3 have complied with the Second Request or such later time as the parties may agree with the DOJ, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier.
We and L3 continue to work cooperatively with the DOJ on its review of the merger.
As part of the regulatory process, we are moving proactively to explore the possible sale of our Night Vision business within our Communication Systems segment.
The assets and liabilities of our Night Vision business were classified as held for use in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (Unaudited) at December 28, 2018 and will continue to be so classified unless the held for sale criteria are met, which has not occurred as of the date of this Report, because our Board of Directors has not approved commitment to any plan of sale.
We and L3 continue to expect the merger to close in the previously announced time frame of mid-calendar year 2019, although we can give no assurances regarding the timing or occurrence of closing.
L3 is a prime contractor in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (“ISR”) systems, aircraft sustainment (including modifications and fleet management of special mission aircraft), simulation and training, night vision and image intensification equipment and security and detection systems headquartered in New York, New York.
L3 is also a provider of a broad range of communication, electronic and sensor systems used on military, homeland security and commercial platforms.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 12, 2018, by and among L3, us, and Merger Sub, a copy of which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 16, 2018.
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Harris Corporation (the Company) as of December 28, 2018, the related condensed consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and equity for the quarter and two quarters ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “condensed consolidated interim financial statements”).
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 29, 2018, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB.
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.
It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Merger Litigation.
As described in Note R — Legal Proceedings and Contingencies in the Notes, in connection with our pending merger with L3 (see Note S — Pending Merger in the Notes for additional information), two putative class action lawsuits and one individual lawsuit were filed against the L3 Parties in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York between December 19, 2018 and January 15, 2019, and a third putative class action lawsuit, Kent v. L3 Technologies, Inc., et al., was filed against the L3 Parties and the Harris Parties in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 4, 2019.
The complaint in the Kent lawsuit further alleges that the Harris Parties are liable for these violations as “controlling persons” of L3 within the meaning of federal securities laws.
The complaints in all four lawsuits generally seek injunctive relief enjoining the merger, damages and costs, among other remedies.
Additional lawsuits in connection with the merger may be filed in the future.
These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with the authorities or ultimately through legal proceedings.
