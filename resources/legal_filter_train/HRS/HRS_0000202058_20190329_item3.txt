Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.
At March 29, 2019, we also had long-term variable-rate debt obligations of $250 million, comprised of $250 million of Floating Rate Notes due April 30, 2020.
We utilize derivative instruments, from time to time, to mitigate interest rate risk associated with anticipated debt transactions.
If the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of such instrument are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
See Note N â€” Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes for additional information.
