Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.
There were no material changes during the quarter ended September 27, 2019 with respect to the information appearing in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” of our Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K.
At September 27, 2019, we also had long-term variable-rate debt obligations of $250 million, comprised of $250 million of Floating Rate Notes due April 30, 2020.
See Note M — Debt in the Notes for further information.
We utilize derivative instruments, from time to time, to mitigate interest rate risk associated with anticipated debt transactions.
If the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of such instrument are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
We designated these treasury locks as cash flow hedges against fluctuations in interest payments on the Notes due to changes in the benchmark interest rate prior to issuance, which we expect to occur before the date of maturity of the 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes.
See Note U — Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes for additional information.
