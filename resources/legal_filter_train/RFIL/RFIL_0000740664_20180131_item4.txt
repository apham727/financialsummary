Item 4.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide reasonable assurance only of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in weighting the costs and benefits of possible new or different controls and procedures.
Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes.
Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Companyâ€™s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date.
