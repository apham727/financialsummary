On March 15, 2019, through C Enterprises, Inc. (“C Enterprises”), its newly formed subsidiary, the Company purchased the business and assets of C Enterprises L.P., a California based designer and manufacturer of quality connectivity solutions to telecommunications and data communications distributors.
The acquisition was determined not to be material and was accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recorded by the Company at their estimated fair values in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the weighted average cost method of accounting.
Certain items in inventory may be considered obsolete or excess and, as such, we periodically review our inventories for excess and slow moving items and make provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value.
The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors.
The Company assesses property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which are considered definite-lived assets, for impairment.
Definite-lived assets are reviewed when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment.
This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to value the stock option grants.
These inputs include the expected term of employee stock options, the expected volatility of the stock price, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.
Through its manufacturing and production facilities, the Company provides a wide selection of interconnect products and solutions primarily to telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers, wireless and network infrastructure carriers and manufacturers and to various original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in several market segments.
For the six months ended April 30, 2019, most of the Company’s revenues were generated from the Custom Cabling segment from the sale of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies, and wiring harnesses (which accounted for 73% of the Company’s total sales for the six months ended April 30, 2019).
Revenues from the RF Connector segment were generated from the sales of RF connector products and connector cable assemblies and accounted for 27% of the Company’s total sales for the six months ended April 30, 2019.
 ·As of April 30, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents equal to $13.9 million.
 ·As of April 30, 2019, the Company had $30.5 million in current assets and $4.7 million in current liabilities.
However, the Company has continued to receive additional bookings while maintaining its level of shipments.
As a result, the Company had $10 million of backlog as of the current quarter ended April 30, 2019.
Furthermore, purchase orders may be subject to cancellation from customers, although the Company has not historically experienced material cancellations of purchase orders.
As a result of the Company’s backlog balance as of April 30, 2019, the Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are expected to continue to improve during the balance of the current fiscal year.
The Company used cash of $2.6 million during the six months ended April 30, 2019 due largely to an increase in sales, which resulted in increased inventory purchases and an increase in outstanding accounts receivables as of quarter-end.
Net income of $1.7 million, with an added increase in cash from noncash credits of $0.3 million from depreciation and amortization and $0.2 million from stock-based compensation expense, was offset by an increase in accounts receivable ($2.4 million) and inventories ($0.3 million) as well as a decrease in accrued expenses primarily due to the payout of prior year bonuses ($0.8 million) and an increase in accounts payable ($0.7 million).
The Company used $0.8 million during the six months ended April 30, 2019 for capital expenditures and the purchase of the assets and business of C Enterprises.
These net cash outlays were partially offset by $0.4 million that the Company received from the exercise of stock options.
The Company does not anticipate needing material additional capital equipment in the next twelve months.
In the past, the Company has financed some of its equipment and furnishings requirements through capital leases.
No additional capital equipment purchases have been currently identified that would require significant additional leasing or capital expenditures during the next twelve months.
Management also believes that based on the Company’s current financial condition, its current backlog of unfulfilled orders and its anticipated future operations, the Company would be able to finance its expansion, if necessary.
Acquisitions may require the outlay of cash, which may reduce the Company’s liquidity and capital resources while dispositions may increase the Company’s cash position, liquidity and capital resources.
For example, on March 15, 2019, the Company purchased all of the assets of C Enterprises for $600,000 in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities.
If the Company acquires other businesses in the future for a purchase price payable in whole or in part in cash, its future liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected.
The Company has previously announced its intention to make additional acquisitions in order to expand its product offerings and customer base.
On October 31, 2018, the Company sold all of the shares of Comnet Telecom Supply, Inc. (“Comnet”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that was part of the Company’s Custom Cabling segment.
During the three months ended April 30, 2018, Comnet had net sales of $1.9 million and income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes of $0.1 million.
During the six months ended April 30, 2018, Comnet had net sales of $4.2 million and income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes of $0.3 million.
Comnet was sold as part of the Company’s business transformation toward a one company culture and operating structure to more efficiently leverage its capabilities across the entire business; Comnet’s business did not match the Company’s go-to-market strategy since it operated with a different sales model and margin profile than the rest of the Company.
On March 15, 2019, the Company acquired the assets and business of C Enterprises, L.P.
The C Enterprises business is now conducted by the Company through its new C Enterprises, Inc. subsidiary.
The Company paid $600,000 of cash, and assumed certain liabilities for the purchase of the C Enterprises business.
The financial results of C Enterprises during the period from March 15, 2019 to April 30, 2019 are included in the results of operations for 2019.
Three Months Ended April 30, 2019 vs. Three Months Ended April 30, 2018
Net sales of $13.6 million decreased by 34%, or $6.9 million, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 quarter”) when compared to the three months ended April 30, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 quarter”).
Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment decreased by $7.5 million, or 42%, when compared to the fiscal 2018 quarter.
The net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment in the fiscal 2019 second quarter were supplemented by $1.7 million of net sales that the Company generated from its newly acquired C Enterprises subsidiary.
The Company did not own C Enterprises in the 2018 fiscal year.
However, net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment for the second quarter ended April 30, 2019 increased over the first quarter ended January 31, 2019.
Even excluding the additional net sales generated by C Enterprises in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales in the Company’s Custom Cabling segment increased by $0.7 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the RF Connector segment increased by $0.6 million, or 22%, to $3.3 million as compared to $2.7 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter.
Engineering expenses decreased $0.3 million during the fiscal 2019 quarter to $0.3 million compared to $0.6 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter due to higher compensation expense related to engineering activities in the fiscal 2018 quarter to support the higher net sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter.
Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products.
Selling and general expenses decreased $0.7 million to $2.4 million compared to $3.1 million in the second quarter last year due to higher compensation expenses in the fiscal 2018 quarter as a result of the higher sales at the Custom Cabling segment.
For the fiscal 2019 quarter, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as compared to $4.4 million and ($0.5) million for the comparable second quarter last year.
The decrease in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment was primarily due to the higher sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter, while the RF Connector segment had an increase in income (loss) from continuing operations due in part to the increase in sales and an increase in gross margins.
The provision for income taxes was 23% and 20% of income before income taxes for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The increase in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily driven by the elimination of the benefit from the domestic production activities deduction and the one-time benefit recorded in the prior year related to the reduction in the Company’s deferred tax liability due to the change in the federal tax rate, both as a result of the Tax Act.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed the Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
In the second quarter of 2019, we completed our analysis to determine the effect of the Tax Act and recorded no additional adjustments as of December 22, 2018.
Six Months Ended April 30, 2019 vs. Six Months Ended April 30, 2018

The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2019 six month period decreased by 6% to 30% compared to 36% in the fiscal 2018 six month period due primarily to the substantially higher revenues at the Custom Cabling division in the fiscal 2018 six month period.
Engineering expenses decreased $0.3 million during the fiscal 2019 six month period to $0.7 million compared to $1.0 million for the fiscal 2018 six month period due to higher compensation expense related to engineering activities to support the higher net sales in the fiscal 2018 six month period.
Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products.
Selling and general expenses decreased by $0.4 million during the fiscal 2019 six month period to $4.4 million from $4.8 million in the fiscal 2018 six month period.
The decrease in selling and general expenses was primarily due to the higher compensation resulting from the higher net sales in the fiscal 2018 six month period.
Selling and general expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 18% for the fiscal 2019 six month period as compared to 17% for the fiscal 2018 six month period partially due to one-time costs of $100,000 related to the acquisition of C Enterprises in the fiscal 2019 quarter, and partially due to the absorption of the selling and general expenses of the newly acquired C Enterprises.
For the fiscal 2019 six month period, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $1.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as compared to $5.0 million and $(0.6) million for the comparable six months last year.
