The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balance, credit quality of the Company’s customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. 
The Company assesses property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which are considered definite-lived assets, for impairment. Definite-lived assets are reviewed when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. 
The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. 
We test our goodwill and trademarks and indefinite-lived assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances requires significant judgment and could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition and sale or disposition of all or a portion of a division. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. 
The purchase agreement for the Rel-Tech acquisition provides for earn-out payments of up to $800,000, payable through May 31, 2018. The fair value of the obligation under the earn-out purchase price arrangement for Rel-Tech was $206,000 as of January 31, 2018. The initial earn-out liability was valued at its fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation and is included as a component of the total purchase price. The earn-out was and will continue to be revalued quarterly using a present value approach and any resulting increase or decrease will be recorded into selling and general expenses. Any changes in the assumed timing and amount of the probability of payment scenarios could impact the fair value. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the earn-out as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, significant variances between actual and forecasted results or changes in the assumptions can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in future periods. 
If a deduction reported on a tax return for an equity-based incentive award exceeds the cumulative compensation cost for those instruments recognized for financial reporting purposes, any resulting realized tax benefit that exceeds the previously calculated deferred tax asset for those instruments is considered an excess tax benefit, and is recognized as additional paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the cumulative book compensation cost, the tax effect of the resulting difference is charged first to additional paid-in capital, to the extent of the available pool of windfall tax benefits, with any remainder recognized in income tax expense. 
The calculation of the tax provision involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.

 ·As of January 31, 2018, the Company had $18.8 million in current assets and $4.9 million in current liabilities. 
 ·As of January 31, 2018, the Company had no outstanding indebtedness for borrowed funds. 
Subsequent to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, the Company has seen an increase in orders for its products in each of its four divisions. As a result of these increased orders, the Company’s backlog has increased from $4.0 million as of October 31, 2017 to $20.2 million as of January 31, 2018. A substantial amount of this backlog is expected to be filled in the upcoming quarter ending April 30, 2018 and the remaining amount of the current backlog largely filled by the end of the current fiscal year ending October 31, 2018. Accordingly, the Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are also expected to materially increase in the current fiscal year. 
The Company used cash of $0.2 million during the three months ended January 31, 2018 due largely to the impact of increased sales. As a result of the increased sales, accounts receivables ($1.5 million) and inventories ($0.7 million) increased, which was partially offset by increased accounts payable ($0.7 million) and accrued expenses ($0.5 million). This net decrease in cash was partially offset by an increase in cash from net income of $0.5 million, noncash credits of $0.2 million primarily from depreciation and amortization related to the acquisitions of Comnet, Rel-Tech and CompPro, and $0.1 million of stock-based compensation expense. In addition, during the quarter the Company received $0.2 million from the exercise of stock options and paid out $0.2 million in dividends. 
The Company does not anticipate needing material additional capital equipment in the next twelve months. In the past, the Company has financed some of its equipment and furnishings requirements through capital leases. No additional capital equipment purchases have been currently identified that would require significant additional leasing or capital expenditures during the next twelve months. Management also believes that based on the Company’s current financial condition, its current backlog of unfulfilled orders and its anticipated future operations, the Company would be able to finance its expansion, if necessary. 
As part of its announced business plan, the Company may from time to time acquire other companies or product lines in the future in order to diversify its product and customer base. Any future acquisitions may require the Company to make cash payments, which may reduce the Company’s future liquidity and capital resources. 
The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter increased by 2% to 30% compared to 28% in the fiscal 2017 quarter due primarily to the increased revenues at the Custom Cabling division. 
Engineering expenses increased $0.1 million during the fiscal 2018 quarter to $0.3 million compared to $0.2 million for the fiscal 2017 quarter due to increased salary expense related to engineering activities. Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products. 
Selling and general expenses increased by $0.2 million during the fiscal 2018 quarter to $2.2 million from $2.0 million in the prior year. Selling and general as a percentage of sales declined to 21% for the fiscal 2018 quarter as compared to 30% for the fiscal 2017 quarter. The increase in selling and general expenses was primarily due to increased compensation in the form of commissions and accrued bonuses. 
For the fiscal 2018 quarter, net income was $0.5 million and fully diluted EPS was $0.05 per share as compared to a net loss of $0.2 million and fully diluted of net loss of $0.02 per share for the fiscal 2017 quarter.
