We evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventory reserves and contingencies on an ongoing basis.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the weighted average cost method of accounting.
Certain items in inventory may be considered obsolete or excess and, as such, we periodically review our inventories for excess and slow moving items and make provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value.
The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors.
The Company assesses property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which are considered definite-lived assets, for impairment.
Definite-lived assets are reviewed when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment.
These events or circumstances requires significant judgment and could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition and sale or disposition of all or a portion of a division.
This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The purchase agreement for the Rel-Tech acquisition provides for earn-out payments of up to $800,000, payable through May 31, 2018.
The earn-out was and will continue to be revalued quarterly using a present value approach and any resulting increase or decrease will be recorded into selling and general expenses.
Any changes in the assumed timing and amount of the probability of payment scenarios could impact the fair value.
Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the earn-out as of the acquisition date.
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
If a deduction reported on a tax return for an equity-based incentive award exceeds the cumulative compensation cost for those instruments recognized for financial reporting purposes, any resulting realized tax benefit that exceeds the previously calculated deferred tax asset for those instruments is considered an excess tax benefit, and is recognized as additional paid-in capital.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to value the stock option grants.
These inputs include the expected term of employee stock options, the expected volatility of the stock price, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.
Through its four manufacturing and production facilities, the Company provides a wide selection of interconnect products and solutions primarily to telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers, wireless and network infrastructure carriers and manufacturers, Data Center and Co-location companies, and to various original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in several market segments.
 ·As of January 31, 2018, the Company had $18.8 million in current assets and $4.9 million in current liabilities.
Subsequent to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, the Company has seen an increase in orders for its products in each of its four divisions.
As a result of these increased orders, the Company’s backlog has increased from $4.0 million as of October 31, 2017 to $20.2 million as of January 31, 2018.
A substantial amount of this backlog is expected to be filled in the upcoming quarter ending April 30, 2018 and the remaining amount of the current backlog largely filled by the end of the current fiscal year ending October 31, 2018.
Accordingly, the Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are also expected to materially increase in the current fiscal year.
The Company used cash of $0.2 million during the three months ended January 31, 2018 due largely to the impact of increased sales.
As a result of the increased sales, accounts receivables ($1.5 million) and inventories ($0.7 million) increased, which was partially offset by increased accounts payable ($0.7 million) and accrued expenses ($0.5 million).
This net decrease in cash was partially offset by an increase in cash from net income of $0.5 million, noncash credits of $0.2 million primarily from depreciation and amortization related to the acquisitions of Comnet, Rel-Tech and CompPro, and $0.1 million of stock-based compensation expense.
In addition, during the quarter the Company received $0.2 million from the exercise of stock options and paid out $0.2 million in dividends.
The Company does not anticipate needing material additional capital equipment in the next twelve months.
In the past, the Company has financed some of its equipment and furnishings requirements through capital leases.
No additional capital equipment purchases have been currently identified that would require significant additional leasing or capital expenditures during the next twelve months.
Management also believes that based on the Company’s current financial condition, its current backlog of unfulfilled orders and its anticipated future operations, the Company would be able to finance its expansion, if necessary.
As part of its announced business plan, the Company may from time to time acquire other companies or product lines in the future in order to diversify its product and customer base.
Any future acquisitions may require the Company to make cash payments, which may reduce the Company’s future liquidity and capital resources.
The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter increased by 2% to 30% compared to 28% in the fiscal 2017 quarter due primarily to the increased revenues at the Custom Cabling division.
Engineering expenses increased $0.1 million during the fiscal 2018 quarter to $0.3 million compared to $0.2 million for the fiscal 2017 quarter due to increased salary expense related to engineering activities.
Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products.
Selling and general expenses increased by $0.2 million during the fiscal 2018 quarter to $2.2 million from $2.0 million in the prior year.
Selling and general as a percentage of sales declined to 21% for the fiscal 2018 quarter as compared to 30% for the fiscal 2017 quarter.
The increase in selling and general expenses was primarily due to increased compensation in the form of commissions and accrued bonuses.

We will complete our analysis over a one-year measurement period ending December 22, 2018, and any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in net earnings from continuing operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined.
