In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases. This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets related to the rights and obligations created by those leases. The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if “the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.” The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Accrued receipts represent purchased inventory for which invoices have not been received. 
On December 13, 2017, the Company granted 80,000 incentive stock options to an employee. These options vested 8,000 shares on the date of grant, and the balance vests as to 8,000 shares per year thereafter on each of the next nine anniversaries of December 13, 2017, and expire ten years from the date of grant. On December 3, 2018, the Company granted each of two employees 25,000 incentive stock options. These options vested 5,000 each on the date of grant, and the balance vests as to 5,000 shares each per year thereafter on each of the next four anniversaries of December 3, 2018, and expire five years from the date of grant. On December 3, 2018, the Company also granted one employee 10,000 incentive stock options. These options vested 2,000 shares on the date of grant, and the balance vests as to 2,000 shares per year thereafter on each of the next four anniversaries of December 3, 2018, and expire five years from the date of grant. No other options were granted to Company employees during the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018. 
Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock price and other factors. The Company used the historical method to calculate the expected life of the 2019 and 2018 option grants. The expected life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate with a maturity date corresponding to the options’ expected life. The dividend yield is based upon the historical dividend yield. 
Non-employee directors receive a compensation package of $50,000 annually, which is paid one-half in cash and one-half through the grant of non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. During the quarter ended January 31, 2019, the Company granted each of its five non-employee directors 6,600 non-qualified stock options. The number of stock options granted to each director was determined by dividing $25,000 by the fair value of a stock option grant using the Black-Scholes model ($3.471 per share). These options vest ratably over fiscal year 2019 and expire five years from the date of grant. Effective November 1, 2018, in addition to the compensation received for serving on the Board of Directors, the Chairman of each committee of the Board will receive $15,000 per year in cash for services rendered as Chairman. 
During the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, stock-based compensation expense totaled $114,000 and $75,000, respectively, and was classified in selling and general expense. 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality financial institutions. At January 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of federally insured limits in the amount of approximately $11.8 million. 
Two customers, a distributor and an equipment manufacturer, accounted for approximately 38% and 14%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales for the three-month period ended January 31, 2019. At January 31, 2019, these two customers’ accounts receivable balances accounted for approximately 30% and 22%, respectively, of the total net accounts receivable balance. For the three-month period ended January 31, 2018, one customer, a distributor, accounted for approximately 47% of the Company’s net sales. At January 31, 2018, this customer’s accounts receivable balance accounted for approximately 44% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable balance. Although these customers have been on-going major customers of the Company, the written agreements with these customers do not have any minimum purchase obligations and they could stop buying the Company’s products at any time and for any reason. A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or the loss of these customers could significantly reduce the Company’s future revenues and profits. 
The RF Connector segment consisted of one division and the Custom Cabling segment was composed of two divisions. The three divisions that met the quantitative thresholds for segment reporting are the RF Connector and Cable Assembly division (“RF Connector division”), Cables Unlimited, and Rel-Tech. While each segment had similar products and services, with one major exception, there was little overlapping of these services to their customer base. In addition, sales or product and services for the RF Connector segment were primarily through the distribution channel while the Custom Cabling segment sales were through a combination of distribution and direct to the end customer. 
As reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Company evaluates the performance of each segment based on income or loss before income taxes. The Company charges depreciation and amortization directly to each division within the segment. Accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets are the only assets identified by segment. Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same for the Company as a whole. 
The Company had $65,000 and $58,000 of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties, as of January 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018, respectively. The unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would result in a net tax benefit of $15,000 as of January 31, 2019. 
Amortization expense for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and the year ended October 31, 2018 was $69,000 and $275,000, respectively. As of January 31, 2019, the weighted-average amortization period for the amortizable intangible assets is 10.98 years. 
The Company currently leases its corporate headquarters and RF connector and cable assembly manufacturing facilities in San Diego, California. On June 5, 2017, the Company entered into a fifth amendment to its lease for its facility in San Diego, California. As a result, the Company now leases a total of approximately 21,908 square feet of office, warehouse and manufacturing space at its San Diego location. The term of the lease expires on July 31, 2022, and the rental payments under the lease currently are $22,721 per month. The San Diego lease also requires the payment of the Company’s pro rata share of real estate taxes and insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses related to the facilities. 
   (iii) On November 1, 2018, the Cables Unlimited division entered into a lease agreement with 100 Bellport Avenue, LLC, as landlord, for approximately 7,500 square feet located in Yaphank, New York, with a monthly rent expense of $5,625. The lease expires on October 31, 2019. On February 1, 2019, Cables Unlimited entered into an amendment to this lease to expand the leased space by an additional 5,000 square feet and increasing the monthly rent expense by $3,750, resulting in a total rent expense of $9,375 per month. The lease’s expiration date remains at October 31, 2019.  
The Company paid dividends of $0.02 per share during the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 for a total of $186,000 and $176,000, respectively.  
On February 1, 2019, Cables Unlimited amended its lease with 100 Bellport Avenue, LLC to expand the leased space by an additional 5,000 square feet, resulting in a total rent expense of $9,375 per month. 
On March 8, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per share to be paid on April 15, 2019 to stockholders of record on March 31, 2019.  
On March 11, 2019, the Company announced that it has entered into a binding agreement to purchase all of the assets of C Enterprises, L.P., a California based designer, manufacturer, and distributor of fiber and copper custom cables and cable assembles, and other related products used in the data center, networking, and wireless markets. The total cash outlay related to the purchase of C Enterprises is currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s liquidity and capital resources.
