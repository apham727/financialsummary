 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
 Foreign currency exchange losses generated from the settlement and remeasurement of these transactions are recognized in earnings and presented within “Other expenses, net” in the Company’s unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses totaled $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 and $2.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.  
 As of March 31, 2018, the Company had no assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.  
to forgo a recognition of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities and record a lease expense on a straight-line basis. Entities should determine at the inception of the arrangement whether a contract represents a lease or contains a lease which is defined as a right to control the use of identified property for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Additionally, entities should separate the lease components from the non-lease components and allocate the contract consideration on a relative standalone price basis in accordance with provisions of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 and should be adopted via a modified retrospective approach with certain optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The Company expects to adopt the guidance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial position and results of operations.  
 In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for reporting credit losses. The new guidance introduces a new "expected loss" impairment model that applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities and other financial assets. Entities are required to estimate expected credit losses over the life of financial assets and record an allowance against the assets’ amortized cost basis to present them at the amount expected to be collected. Additionally, the guidance amends the impairment model for available for sale debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on such debt security is a credit loss. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of the newly issued guidance is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The standard should be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company expects to adopt the guidance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial position and results of operations.  
 For further information with regard to the Company’s Significant Accounting Policies, please refer to Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10‑K.  
 The Company invests in marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale and records them at fair value in the Company’s unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Marketable securities reported as current assets represent 
investments that mature within one year from the balance sheet date. Long-term marketable securities represent investments with maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. The securities are valued using matrix pricing and benchmarking and classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are not actively traded. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted prices.  
 Expected maturities could differ from contractual maturities because the security issuers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.  
 Cash equivalents of $51.2 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017 consist of money market funds and are classified within Level 1 of fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. Cash equivalents of $0.5 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively at 
March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017 consist primarily of bank certificates of deposits with original maturities of less than 90 days and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are not actively traded.   
 On October 5, 2017, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of 4titude Limited (“4titude”), a U.K.-based manufacturer of scientific consumables for biological sample materials used in a variety of genomic and DNA analytical applications. The acquisition of 4titude will expand the Company’s existing offerings of consumables and instruments within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. The aggregate purchase price of $65.1 million, net of cash acquired, consisted primarily of a cash payment of $64.8 million subject to working capital adjustments and the assumption of the seller’s liabilities of $0.4 million.  
 The Company used a market participant approach to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the 4titude acquisition. The purchase price allocation is based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to further adjustments within the measurement period as additional information becomes available related to the fair value of such assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company will refine such fair value estimates as new information becomes available during the measurement period. Any adjustments to the purchase price allocation will be made as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the acquisition date.  
 Fair values of intangible assets acquired consisted of customer relationships of $21.4 million, completed technology of $5.2 million, backlog of $0.4 million and trademarks of $0.2 million. The Company used the income approach in accordance with the excess-earnings method to estimate the fair values of customer relationships, backlog and trademarks equal to the present value of the after-tax cash flows attributable to each intangible asset. The Company used the income approach in accordance with the relief-from-royalty method to estimate the fair value of the completed technology which is equal to the present value of the after-tax royalty savings attributable to owning that intangible asset. The weighted average amortization periods for intangible assets acquired are 13 years for completed technology, 10 years for customer relationship intangible assets, 1 year for backlog and 1 year for trademarks. The intangible assets acquired are amortized over the total weighted average period of 10.4 years using methods that approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.   
 At the closing of the acquisition of 4titude, a cash payment of $0.4 million was placed into escrow which was ascribed to the purchase price. The escrow was related to potential working capital adjustments and the sellers’ satisfaction of general representations and warranties. The escrow balance was $0.2 million as of March 31, 2018.   
 Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired and has been assigned to the Brooks Life Sciences segment. Goodwill is primarily the result of expected synergies from combining the operations of 4titude with the Company’s operations and is not deductible for tax purposes.  
 The operating results of 4titude have been reflected in the results of operations for the Brooks Life Sciences segment from the date of the acquisition, which included approximately six months of activity during the first two quarter of fiscal year 2018. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, revenue and net loss from 4titude recognized in the Company’s results of operations were $4.3 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively. During the six months ended March 31, 2018, revenue and net loss from 4titude recognized in the Company’s results of operations were $7.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively. During the six months ended March 31, 2018, the net loss included non-recurring charges of $1.2 million related to the step-up in value of the acquired inventories. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, the net loss included recurring charges of $1.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, related to amortization expense of acquired intangible assets.  
 Acquisition of Pacific Bio-Material Management, Inc. and Novare, LLC  
 On July 5, 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Pacific Bio-Material Management, Inc. (“PBMMI”) and Novare, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of PBMMI (collectively, the “sellers”), pursuant to which the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the sellers’ business related to providing storage, transportation, management, and cold chain logistics of biological materials. The Company paid to the sellers cash consideration of $34.3 million, net of cash acquired and subject to working capital adjustments. As of December 31, 2017, the purchase price allocation is based on a preliminary valuation and subject to further adjustments when the Company obtains additional information during the measurement period.   
 At the closing of the acquisition of PBMMI, a cash payment of $3.3 million was placed into escrow which was ascribed to the purchase price. The escrow balance of $3.3 million included $2.9 million related to satisfaction of the sellers' indemnification obligations with respect to their representations and warranties and other indemnities, as well as $0.4 million payable to the former owner of Novare as a compensation for a sale of his ownership interest. This escrow arrangement is administered by the Company on behalf of the sellers. As of March 31, 2018, the escrow balance related to satisfaction of the sellers' indemnification obligations was $2.7 million, and the Novare escrow balance had been released.  
 The operating results of PBMMI have been reflected in the results of operations for the Brooks Life Sciences segment from the date of the acquisition. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, revenue and net loss from PBMMI recognized in the Company’s results of operations were $2.5 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively. During the six months ended March 31, 2018, revenue and net loss from PBMMI recognized in the Company’s results of operations were $4.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, the net loss included recurring charges of $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, related to amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. Please refer to Note 3, "Acquisitions" to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on PBMMI acquisition.  
 On November 28, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the equity of Cool Lab, LLC ("Cool Lab") from BioCision, LLC ("BioCision"). The Company held a 20% equity ownership interest in BioCision prior to the acquisition. The Company used a market participant approach to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Cool Lab acquisition. The purchase price allocation were finalized as of March 31, 2018. Please refer to Note 3, “Acquisitions” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on this transaction.  
 The Company recorded a liability of $0.7 million in the purchase price allocation that represented a preacquisition contingency incurred on the acquisition date. The obligation is related to a rebate that is due to a particular customer if the annual product sales volume metrics exceed threshold amounts under the provisions of the contract assumed by the Company. Fair value of such liability was determined based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The carrying amount of the liability was $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017.   
 Goodwill represents the excess of net book value over the estimated fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of a reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more often if impairment indicators are present at the reporting unit level. The Company elected April 1 as its annual goodwill impairment assessment date and performs additional impairment tests if triggering events occur. If events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce fair values of the reporting units below their carrying values, goodwill will be evaluated for impairment between annual tests. No triggering events indicating goodwill impairment occurred during the six months ended March 31, 2018. Please refer to Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal year 2017.   
 During the six months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a goodwill increase of $41.6 million primarily related to the acquisition of 4titude which represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Please refer to the Note 4 "Acquisitions" for further information on this transaction.  
 Amortization expense for intangible assets was $11.1 million and $8.4 million, respectively, during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.

 There were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017. The Company records commitment fees and other costs directly associated with obtaining line of credit financing as deferred financing costs which are presented within "Other assets" in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. At March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, deferred financing costs were $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Such costs are amortized over the term of the related financing arrangement and are included in “Interest expense” in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company was in compliance with the line of credit covenants as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017.   
 On October 4, 2017, the Company entered into a $200.0 million term loan with the lenders. The term loan was issued at $197.6 million, or 98.8% of its par value, resulting in a discount of $2.4 million, or 1.2%, which represented loan origination fees paid at the closing. The Company incurred additional deferred financing costs of $0.4 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018. The loan proceeds are to be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The loan principal amount may be increased by an aggregate amount equal to $75.0 million plus any voluntary repayments of the term loans plus any additional amount such that the secured leverage ratio of the Company is less than 3.00 to 1.00.   
 The Company’s obligations under the term loan are also guaranteed by BioStorage Technologies, Inc. as the guarantor, subject to the terms and conditions of the term loan agreement. The Company and the guarantor granted the lenders a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and the guarantor to secure the repayment of the term loan.  
 The term loan matures and becomes fully payable on October 4, 2024. The principal is payable in installments equal to 0.25% of the initial principal amount of the term loans on March 31st, June 30th, September 30th and December 31st of each year, commencing on March 31,2018, with any remaining amount of principal becoming due and payable on the maturity date. All accrued and unpaid interest on Borrowings shall be due on the last day of each interest period elected 
by the Company for such Borrowings, except for interest periods of more than three months in which case all accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable every three months.  
 Subject to certain conditions stated in the term loan agreement, the Company may redeem the term loan at any time at its option without a significant premium or penalty, except for a repricing transaction, as defined in the term loan agreement. The Company would be required to redeem the term loan at the principal amount then outstanding upon occurrence of certain events, including (i) net proceeds received from the sale or other disposition of the Company’s or guarantor’ assets, subject to certain limitations, (ii) casualty and condemnation proceeds received by the Company or the guarantor, subject to certain exceptions, (iii) net proceeds received by the Company or the guarantor from the issuance of debt or disqualified capital stock after October 4, 2017. Commencing on December 31, 2018, the Company will be required to make principal payments equal to the excess cash flow amount, as defined in the term loan agreement. Such prepayments are equal to 50% of the preceding year excess cash flow amount reduced by voluntary prepayments of the term loan, subject to certain limitations.  
 The Company records commitment fees and other costs directly associated with obtaining term loan financing as deferred financing costs which are presented as a reduction of the term loan principal balance in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such costs are accreted over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method and are included in “Interest expense” in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. At March 31, 2018, deferred financing costs were $2.6 million.   
 During the six months ended March 31, 2018, the weighted average stated interest rate paid on the term loan was 4%.

The term loan agreement does not contain financial maintenance covenants. As of March 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the term loan agreement.   
 As of March 31, 2018, estimated fair value of the term loan outstanding principal balance approximates its carrying value. The fair value was determined based on observable market inputs and classified within Level 2 of fair value hierarchy due to a lack of an active market for this term loan or a similar loan instrument.   
 The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $43.9 million and $41.0 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018. The tax benefit recorded during each period was primarily driven by a discrete

The units will vest on the date which is one day before the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders, but certain holders have elected to defer the receipt of the Company shares until they attain a certain age or cease to provide services to the Company in their capacity as Board members. The amount of units granted during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 related to deferred quarterly dividends was equal to the value of cash dividends that would be paid on the number of total deferred shares based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on the dividend record date. Such units vested upon their issuance, but the settlement was deferred by certain holders for the same conditions, as described above.  
 Performance-based restricted stock units are earned based on the achievement of performance criteria established by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The criteria for performance-based awards are weighted and have threshold, target and maximum performance goals.  
maximum threshold. Performance below the minimum threshold for each financial metric results in award forfeitures. Performance goals will be measured over a three year period at the end of fiscal year 2020 to determine the number of units earned by recipients who continue to meet a service requirement. Units held by recipients who fail to meet the continued service requirement are forfeited. Earned units for recipients who continue to meet the service requirements vest on the date the Company’s Board of Directors determines the number of units earned, which will be approximately the third anniversary of the grant date.  
 Performance-based awards granted in fiscal year 2016 also include provisions that allow participants to earn threshold, target and maximum awards ranging from 0% of the award for performance below the minimum threshold, 100% of the award for performance at target, and up to a maximum of 200% of the award if the Company achieves the maximum performance goals.  
 The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $25.41 and $20.76, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $33.61 and $14.32, respectively.

The Company had one customer that accounted for 10% or more of its consolidated revenue, at 12% and 11%, respectively, during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the Company had no customers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total receivables.  
 For purposes of determining the percentage of revenue generated from any of the Company’s original equipment manufacturer (the "OEM") customers, the Company does not include revenue from products sold to contract manufacturer customers who in turn sell to the OEMs. If the Company included revenue from products sold to contract manufacturer customers supporting the Company’s OEM customers, the percentage of the Company’s total revenue derived from certain OEM customers would be higher.  
 16. Commitments and Contingencies  
 The Company has non-cancellable contracts and purchase orders for inventory of $163.7 million and $122.0 million, respectively, at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017.  
 On April 6, 2018, the Company acquired approximately 93% of the outstanding capital stock of Tec-Sem Group AG (“Tec-Sem”), a Switzerland-based manufacturer of semiconductor fab automation equipment with a focus on reticle management.
