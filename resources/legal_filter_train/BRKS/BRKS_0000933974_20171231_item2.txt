anticipated or unanticipated events.
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q to "we", "us", "our" and "the Company" refer to Brooks Automation, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 We are a leading global provider of automation and cryogenic solutions for multiple applications and markets.
We primarily serve the semiconductor capital equipment market and sample management market for life sciences.
Our leadership position and global support structure in each of these markets makes us a valued business partner to the some of the world’s largest semiconductor capital equipment and device makers, as well as pharmaceutical and life science research institutions in the world.
 In the life sciences sample management market, we utilize our core competencies and capabilities in automation and cryogenics to provide comprehensive bio-sample management solutions to a broad range of end markets within the life sciences industry.
Over the past several years, we have acquired and developed essential capabilities required to strategically address the sample management needs across multiple end markets within the life sciences industry.
In October 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of 4titude Limited, or 4titude, a U.K.-based manufacturer of scientific consumables for biological sample materials used in a variety of genomic and DNA analytical applications, for a total purchase price of $65.2 million, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition will expand our existing offerings of consumables and instruments within the Brooks Life Sciences segment.
Please refer to Note 4, “Acquisitions” in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q for further information on this transaction.
Since entering the life sciences industry, we have also strengthened and broadened our product portfolio and market reach by investing in internal product development.
During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, more than 23% of our cumulative research and development spending was focused on innovating and advancing solutions in the life sciences sample management market.
In fiscal year 2016, we commercialized the internally developed Biostore III Cryo, an automated system which incorporates sample retrieval, archiving, monitoring, tracking, inventory control, and related enterprise systems connectivity with the industry’s leading cryogenic sample storage freezers.
In fiscal year 2017, we launched BioStudies, a bioinformatics sample intelligence software platform that enables customers to manage their global samples.
 We report our financial results for two operating and reportable segments which consist of Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and the Brooks Life Sciences segment.
 Results of Operations- Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased to $189.3 million, or by 18%, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Gross margin was 39.7% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to 35.6% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, which resulted in an increase in gross profit of $18.3 million.
Operating expenses were $54.4 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to $43.8 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of $10.6 million.
The increase of $2.6 million was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income of $7.7 million, as noted above, partically offset by the impact of non-operating expenses which reduced net income by $5.3 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
 Cash Flows and Liquidity- Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $231.9 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $104.3 million at September 30, 2017.
The increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $127.6 million was primarily attributable to cash inflows of $197.6 million related to proceeds from the term loan and cash inflows of $3.2 million generated from our operating activities, partially offset by cash outflows related to acquisition payments of $65.1 million, dividend payments of $7.1 million made to our shareholders during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, as well as capital expenditures of $2.7 million.
Cash inflows of $3.2 million generated from operating activities during the three months ended December 31, 2017 were comprised primarily of earnings of $27.1 million, including net income of $16.5 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $10.6 million, partially offset by uses of cash of $23.9 million related to the changes in our operating assests and liabilities, net of acquisitions.
Please refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below for a detailed discussion of our liquidity and changes in cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.

 We reported revenue of $189.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $160.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $29.4 million, or 18%.
We reported revenue growth in both the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and the Brooks Life Sciences segment.
The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected revenue by $2.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
 Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported revenue of $141.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $126.6 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $15.3 million, or 12%, reflects increases in sales of cryogenic pump products, robotic automation products and services and related spare parts, partially offset by a decline in sales of contamination controls systems.
The increase in revenue includes the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $1.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The semiconductor markets are cyclical, and often fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.
 Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported revenue of $47.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $33.3 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $14.1 million, or 42%, was primarily from internal growth of $7.7 million, principally in sample storage services, automated storage systems, consumables and instruments, and software.

 Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 33.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 34.4% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The decrease was a result of higher production costs and higher charges related to the sale of inventories obtained in acquisitions to which a step-up in value was applied in purchase accounting.
Such charges were $1.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.1 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
These increases were partially offset by a more favorable mix of products and services, volume leverage and higher margins on automated storage systems, consumables, and sample storage services.

 During the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded an income tax provision of $2.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively.
The tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by the foreign income generated during the current quarter.

Under SAB 118, a company may report provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates where the accounting is incomplete.
These amounts are subject to adjustments during a measurement period of up to one year beginning in the reporting period of the enactment date.
We have estimated that our accumulated foreign earnings are $120 million, which is a provisional amount subject to the measurement period described in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118.
There are still incomplete components related to the accumulated foreign earnings calculations for older tax years that require additional time to complete the calculations.
