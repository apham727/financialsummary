In October 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of 4titude Limited, or 4titude, a U.K.-based manufacturer of scientific consumables for biological sample materials used in a variety of genomic and DNA analytical applications.
The acquisition has expanded our existing offerings of consumables and instruments within the Brooks Life Sciences segment.
In April 2018, we acquired BioSpeciMan Corporation, or BioSpeciMan, a Canadian provider of storage services for biological sample materials.
The acquisition has expanded customer relationships and geographic reach within our growing sample management storage services business.
GENEWIZ is a global leader in genomics services that enable research scientists to advance their discoveries within the pharmaceutical, academic, biotechnology, agriculture and other markets.
GENEWIZ provides gene sequencing and synthesis services for more than 4,000 institutional customers worldwide supported by their global network of laboratories spanning the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.
This transaction will add a new and innovative platform which we expect to leverage, along with our core capabilities, to add even more value to samples under our care.
Please refer to Note 5, “Acquisitions” in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q for further information on these transactions.
Since entering the life sciences industry, we have also strengthened and broadened our product portfolio and market reach by investing in internal product development and sales and marketing infrastructure.
 Results of Operations- Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2018 increased to $179.4 million, or by 26%, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Gross margin was 40.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 38.1% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, which resulted in an increase in gross profit of $17.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of the fiscal year 2018.
Operating income was $5.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to $4.9 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Income from continuing operations was $6.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as compared to $1.6 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $4.6 million was primarily attributable to an increase in the tax benefit of $5.2 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
 Cash Flows and Liquidity- Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $138.3 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $251.2 million at September 30, 2018.
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $112.9 million was primarily attributable to net cash outflows of $445.2 million to acquire GENEWIZ, cash dividends paid of $7.2 million and capital expenditures of $3.6 million, partially offset by cash inflows from proceeds received from the amendment to our existing term loan of $340.5 million, proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $51.5 million and net cash inflows from operating activities of $6.3 million.
The $6.3 million of cash generated from operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 was comprised primarily of earnings of $21.5 million, including net income of $14.4 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $7.1 million, partially offset by uses of cash of $15.2 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions.
Please refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below for a detailed discussion of our liquidity and changes in cash flows for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
 Our unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.
 For a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to our unaudited consolidated financial statements, please refer to Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q.
 We reported revenue of $179.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, compared to $142.6 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $36.8 million, or 26%.
We reported revenue growth in both the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and the Brooks Life Sciences segment.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting guidance for recognizing revenue on a modified retrospective basis.
The difference in reported revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 due to the adoption of the standard was a net decrease of $0.4 million.
 Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported revenue of $112.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $95.2 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $17.5 million, or 18%.
The increase was primarily driven by increases in sales of system automation products, semiconductor services and contamination control systems, partially offset by a decline in sales of robotic automation products.
Additionally, the acquisition of Tec-Sem contributed incremental revenue of $9.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The semiconductor markets are cyclical and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.
The difference in reported revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net increase of $0.4 million.
 Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported revenue of $66.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $47.4 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $19.2 million, or 41%, was from internal growth of $2.6 million, principally in sample storage services, automated storage systems and related services and sample management services.
Additionally, the acquisitions of BioSpeciMan and GENEWIZ contributed incremental revenue of $16.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The difference in reported revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease of $0.8 million.
 Revenue generated outside the United States was $110.5 million, or 62% of total revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $90.7 million, or 64% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
We had no customers that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue for each of the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Gross margin increased in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 0.3 percentage points and in the Brooks Life Sciences segment by 6.0 percentage points in the 2019 period over the 2018 period.
Cost of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2018 included $2.0 million of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $0.9 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Cost of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2018 also included $0.2 million of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting, as compared to $1.2 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Excluding the purchasing accounting impact related to inventory step-up and the amortization of completed technology, gross margins expanded 1.9 percentage points during the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The difference in reported gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net increase in gross profit of $0.1 million.
 Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 40.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 40.5% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase is driven by volume leverage of fixed costs partially offset by higher warranty expense.
Cost of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2018 included $0.9 million of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $0.5 million incurred during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The results for the three months ended December 31, 2018 included $0.2 million of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting.
There were no such charges during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Excluding the purchase accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 0.7 percentage points during the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The difference in reported gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net increase in gross profit of $0.4 million.
 Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 39.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 33.2% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Cost of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2018 included $1.1 million of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $0.4 million incurred during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Cost of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 also included $1.2 million of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting.
Excluding the purchasing accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins increased 4.4 percentage points for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The difference in reported gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease in gross profit of $0.3 million.
 Research and development expenses were $13.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $11.4 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $1.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 reflects greater investments in the 2019 period of $1.0 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and $0.8 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment.
Higher research and development expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of prior fiscal year were primarily attributable new acquisitions and higher employee related costs.
 Amortization expense related primarily to customer relationships was $5.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $4.6 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
 Restructuring charges were nominal during the three months ended December 31, 2018.
There were no restructuring charges during the three months ended December 31, 2017.
 Interest income- During the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded interest income of $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, which represented income earned on our marketable securities.
 Interest expense- During the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded interest expense of $5.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
The increase in interest expense is due to interest on the $350.0 million incremental term loan secured in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 used to pay a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of GENEWIZ.
 Other expenses, net- During the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 we recorded other expenses, net of less than $0.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
The $1.9 million decrease was primarily attributable to higher foreign currency exchange losses of $2.0 million recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the current year period.
 We recorded an income tax benefit of $5.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and an income tax benefit of $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by discrete benefits related to stock compensation windfalls of $3.7 million for tax deductions that exceeded the associated compensation expense, $1.4 million of tax benefits related to the remeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax assets due to state tax rate changes, and a $1.1 million transition tax reduction.
These discrete benefits were slightly offset by the tax provision on foreign earnings during the period.
 The tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by discrete benefits related to the reduction of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $0.3 million and $0.7 million of tax benefits related to the remeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the reduced 21 percent federal income tax rate.
These discrete benefits were slightly offset by the tax provision on foreign earnings during the period.
We finalized our analysis of the toll charge and related liabilities, including uncertain tax positions, during the three months ended December 31, 2018 pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
 We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by tax-paying component and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an annual and quarterly basis.
 During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $37.4 million of deferred tax liabilities in purchase accounting in connection with the acquisition of GENEWIZ.
Also, as a result of the acquisition, we recorded a $13.4 million reserve in purchase accounting for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken by GENEWIZ in prior years.
118 and have decided to maintain our indefinite reinvestment assertion.
These liabilities involve judgment and estimation and are monitored based on the best information available.
We recognize interest related to unrecognized benefits as a component of the income tax benefit, of which $0.1 million was recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2018.
We currently anticipate that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced by approximately $0.1 million within the next twelve months.
 We incurred revenue and net income from discontinued operations of $39.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively for the three months ended December 31, 2018 related to our semiconductor cryogenics business as compared to $46.7 million and $14.9 million, respectively for the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The net income is inclusive of income from the Ulvac Cryogenics, Inc. joint venture in 2018 and 2017.
Indirect expenses which supported the Cryogenics business, and which will remain as part of the continuing operations, are not reflected in income from discontinued operations.
We believe that we have adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, financing activities, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
 The discussion of our cash flows and liquidity that follows does not include the impact of the disposition of our cryogenics business and is stated on a total company consolidated basis.
 Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world.
As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $135.8 million, of which $99.1 million was held outside of the United States.
Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current operating plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations.
At December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018, we had marketable securities of $2.5 million and $53.5 million, respectively.
 Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $138.3 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $251.2 million at September 30, 2018.
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $112.9 million was primarily attributable to net cash outflows of $445.2 million to acquire GENEWIZ, cash dividends paid of $7.2 million and capital expenditures of $3.6 million, partially offset by cash inflows from proceeds received from the incremental amendment to our existing term loan of $340.5 million, proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $51.5 million and net cash inflows from operating activities of $6.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2018.
 Cash flows provided by operating activities were $6.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2018, comprised primarily of earnings of $21.5 million, including net income of $14.4 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $7.1 million.
Partially offsetting these items were the uses of cash of $15.2 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
The changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in a use of cash consisted primarily of an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher revenue, an increase in inventory levels to support the growth of our business and a decrease in accrued compensation and tax withholdings as a result of year-end cash incentive bonus payments.
These uses of cash were partially offset by sources of cash related primarily to increases in accounts payable.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $3.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and comprised primarily of earnings of $27.1 million, including net income of $16.5 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $10.6 million, partially offset by the use of $23.9 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
 Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities as well as cash proceeds generated from sales and maturities of marketable securities.
Cash used in investing activities of $398.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2018 included cash outflow of $445.2 million for the acquisition of GENEWIZ, $3.6 million of capital expenditures, and $1.3 million for the purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by cash inflows from the proceeds of sales and maturities of marketable securities of $51.5 million.
 On October 4, 2017, we entered into a $200.0 million term loan with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.
The term loan was issued at $197.6 million, or 98.8% of its par value, resulting in a discount of $2.4 million, or 1.2%, which represented loan origination fees paid at the closing.
On November 15, 2018, we entered into an incremental amendment, or the Amendment to the existing credit agreement.
Under the Amendment, we obtained an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million.
The proceeds of the incremental loan were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of GENEWIZ acquisition.
Except as provided in the Amendment, the incremental loan is subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the existing credit agreement.
increased by an aggregate amount equal to $75.0 million plus any voluntary repayments of the term loans plus any additional amount such that the secured leverage ratio of the Company is less than 3.00 to 1.00.
Installment principal payments equal to 0.25% of the initial principal amount of the term loan are payable on the last day of each quarter, with any remaining principal amount becoming due and payable on the maturity date.
Subject to certain conditions stated in the term loan agreement, we may redeem the term loans at any time at our option without a significant premium or penalty, except for a repricing transaction, as defined in the original term loan agreement and the Amendment.
We would also be required to redeem the term loan at the principal amounts then outstanding upon the occurrence of certain events, as set forth in the original term loan agreement and the Amendment.
At December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate outstanding principal balances of $5.3 million for these term loans.
 At December 31, 2018, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loans was $540.8 million, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs of $11.6 million.
During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we incurred aggregate interest expense of $5.3 million on the term loan.
Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded through our existing sources of liquidity and operating cash flows.
 The term loan agreement and the Amendment contain certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default.
As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the term loan agreement.
 We maintain a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
The proceeds from the line of credit are available for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $47.3 million available for borrowing under the line of credit.
There were no amounts outstanding pursuant to the line of credit as of December 31, 2018.
The amount of funds available for borrowing under the line of credit arrangement may fluctuate each period based on our borrowing base availability.
The line of credit contains certain customary representations and warranties, a financial covenant, affirmative and negative covenants, as well as events of default.
We were in compliance with the line of credit covenants as of December 31, 2018.
Although we believe we will be able to generate sufficient cash in the United States and foreign jurisdictions to fund future operating costs, we secured the revolving line of credit as an additional assurance for maintaining liquidity in the United States during potentially severe downturns of the cyclical semiconductor market, as well as for strategic investments and acquisitions.
 On July 27, 2016, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to sell securities, including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, depositary shares, purchase contracts and purchase units in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering.
The specific terms of any securities to be sold will be described in supplemental filings with the SEC.
 On January 30, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share payable on March 22, 2019 to common stockholders of record as of March 1, 2019.
We may reduce, delay or cancel a quarterly cash dividend based on the severity of a cyclical downturn.
 On September 29, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to $50.0 million worth of our common stock.
There were no shares repurchased under this program during the three months ended December 31, 2018.
 Our non-cancellable inventory purchase commitments were $95.9 million at December 31, 2018.
 At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.3 million of letters of credit outstanding related primarily to customer advances and other performance obligations.
These arrangements guarantee the refund of advance payments received from our customers in the event that the product is not delivered or warranty obligations are not fulfilled in accordance with the contract terms.
These obligations could be called by the beneficiaries at any time before the expiration date of the particular letter of credit if we fail to meet certain contractual requirements.
None of these obligations were called during the three months ended December 31, 2018, and we currently do not anticipate any of these obligations to be called in the near future.
 As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
 Item 2.
 On September 29, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to $50.0 million worth of our common stock.
There were no shares repurchased under this program during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and there have been no shares repurchased under this program since its inception.
 Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
