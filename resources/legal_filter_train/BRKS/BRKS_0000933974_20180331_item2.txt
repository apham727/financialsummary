 Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q to "we", "us", "our" and "the Company" refer to Brooks Automation, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 We are a leading global provider of automation and cryogenic solutions for multiple applications and markets.
We primarily serve the semiconductor capital equipment market and sample management market for life sciences.
Our leadership position and global support structure in each of these markets makes us a valued business partner to the some of the world’s largest semiconductor capital equipment and device makers, as well as pharmaceutical and life science research institutions in the world.
 In the life sciences sample management market, we utilize our core competencies and capabilities in automation and cryogenics to provide comprehensive bio-sample management solutions to a broad range of end markets within the life sciences industry.
Our offerings include automated ultra-cold storage freezers, consumable sample storage containers, instruments which assist in the workflow of sample management, and both complete on-site and off-site full sample management services.
Over the past several years, we have acquired and developed essential capabilities required to strategically address the sample management needs across multiple end markets within the life sciences industry.
In October 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of 4titude Limited, or 4titude, a U.K.-based manufacturer of scientific consumables for biological sample materials used in a variety of genomic and DNA analytical applications, for a total purchase price of $65.1 million, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition will expand our existing offerings of consumables and instruments within the Brooks Life Sciences segment.
Please refer to Note 4, “Acquisitions” in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q for further information on this transaction.
Since entering the life sciences industry, we have also strengthened and broadened our product portfolio and market reach by investing in internal product development.
During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, more than 23% of our cumulative research and development spending was focused on innovating and advancing solutions in the life sciences sample management market.
In fiscal year 2016, we commercialized the internally developed Biostore III Cryo, an automated system which incorporates sample retrieval, archiving, monitoring, tracking, inventory control, and related enterprise systems connectivity with the industry’s leading cryogenic sample storage freezers.
In fiscal year 2017, we launched BioStudies, a bioinformatics sample intelligence software platform that enables customers to manage their global samples.
research and development and making strategic acquisitions and other investments with the objective of expanding our offerings in the life sciences sample management market.
On April 24, 2018, the Company acquired BioSpeciMan Corporation, a Canadian provider of storage services for biological sample materials.
The acquisition is expected to expand customer relationships and geographic reach within our growing sample management storage services business.
Gross margin was 40.6% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to 38.1% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, which resulted in an increase in gross profit of $19.7 million.
Operating expenses were $60.4 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to $49.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of $10.7 million.
Net income was $67.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $14.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $53.0 million was primarily attributable to the decrease in income taxes of $47.3 million driven by the substantial release of the tax valuation allowance of $46.2 million and an increase in operating income of $9.0 million, as noted above.
These increases were partially offset by higher non-operating expenses of $1.9 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, primarily related to interest expense on the term loan and lower net income from equity method investments of $1.4 million.

These increases were partially offset by higher non-operating expenses of $7.2 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, primarily related to increased interest expense of $4.2 million mainly due to the term loan, higher foreign exchanges losses of $1.5 million and the impact of a $1.8 million gain recorded on the settlement of our investment in Biocision during the six months ended March 31, 2017.
 Cash Flows and Liquidity- Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $245.2 million at March 31, 2018 as compared to $104.3 million at September 30, 2017.
The increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $140.9 million was primarily attributable to cash inflows related to proceeds from the term loan of $197.6 million and cash inflows of $23.4 million generated from our operating activities, partially offset by cash outflows related to acquisition payments of $65.0 million, dividend payments of $14.1 million made to our shareholders during the first half of fiscal year 2018, as well as capital expenditures of $5.7 million.
Cash inflows of $23.4 million generated
from operating activities during the six months ended March 31, 2018 were comprised primarily of earnings of $57.6 million, including net income of $83.5 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $25.9 million, partially offset by uses of cash of $34.2 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions.
