Revenue generated outside the United States was $115.7 million, or 57% of total revenue, for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $110.7 million, or 64% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Revenue generated outside the United States was $342.4 million, or 59% of total revenue, for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $298.0 million, or 63% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
We had no customers that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue for each of the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
We reported gross margins of 41.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 38.8% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Gross margin increased in the Brooks Life Sciences Segment by 3.6 percentage points and in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 1.6 percentage points in the 2019 period over the 2018 period.
We reported gross margins of 40.6% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 38.9% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Gross margin increased in the Brooks Life Sciences segment by 3.7 percentage points and in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group by 0.1 percentage points in the 2019 period over the 2018 period.
Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 also included $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting, as compared to $0.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
Excluding the purchasing accounting impact related to inventory step-up and the amortization of completed technology, gross margins expanded 2.3 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease in gross profit of $0.4 million and $0.9 million during three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.

favorable customer mix and product mix.
Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 40.8% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 39.9% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase is driven primarily by customer and product mix and productivity improvements in our services reporting unit.
Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 included $0.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $1.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
The results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 included $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting as compared to $0.8 million during both the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
Excluding the purchase accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 0.8 percentage points, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net increase in gross profit of $0.2 million and $0.8 million during three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 41.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 37.4% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 40.3% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 36.6% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase during both periods was due to a higher margin revenue mix from GENEWIZ.
Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 included $2.0 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
The results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 included $0.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting as compared to no such charges during both the corresponding periods of the current fiscal year.
Excluding the purchase accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 5.1 percentage points and 4.2 percentage points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease in gross profit of $0.6 million and $1.8 million during three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
Research and development expenses were $14.2 million and $41.5 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $12.0 million and $34.8 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $2.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2018 reflects higher expense of $1.2 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and $1.0 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment.
The increase of $6.7 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the same period of fiscal year 2018 reflects higher expense of $3.8 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and $2.9 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $52.6 million and $158.5 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $42.1 million and $120.7 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $10.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior year was primarily attributable to the selling, general and administrative infrastructure at GENEWIZ, and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of GENEWIZ.
These impacts were partially offset by lower expense accruals in the 2019 period as compared to the 2018 period related to variable compensation and lower professional services and merger and acquisition related expenses.
The increase of $37.8 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year was driven by selling, general and administrative expenses related to the acquisitions of GENEWIZ and Tec Sem and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with both acquisitions and higher merger and acquisition related expenses, partially offset by lower expenses related to
professional services and variable compensation as compared to the 2018 period.
The nine months ended June 30, 2019 included a $1.1 million credit related to an insurance claim.
Interest income - During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded interest income of $0.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as compared to $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
Interest expense - During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded interest expense of $8.0 million and $21.3 million, respectively, as compared to $2.5 million and $6.8 million, respectively, during corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
The increase in interest expense in the 2019 periods compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year are due to interest on the incremental term loan secured in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 to pay a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of GENEWIZ.
Loss on extinguishment of debt - During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9.1 million in connection with the syndication of the incremental term loan secured during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The syndication to a new group of lenders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 met the criteria of a debt extinguishment and therefore the amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the origination of the incremental term loan was accelerated and recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt in our statement of operations.
Other expenses, net - During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded other expenses, net of $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, as compared to $0.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, of the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.
The $1.9 million decrease during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to lower foreign currency exchange losses.
We recorded an income tax expense of $7.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019.
These expenses were partially offset by a discrete benefit for stock compensation windfalls of $0.4 million for tax deductions that exceeded the associated compensation expense, and a $0.3 million reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit upon the closing of an audit.
We recorded an income tax provision of $5.4 million and benefit of $49.8 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The tax provision for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was the result of our earnings for the period.
The tax benefit recorded during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by a discrete benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance against U.S. net deferred tax assets in the amount of $56.3
We finalized our analysis of the toll charge and related liabilities, including uncertain tax positions, during the three months ended December 31, 2018 pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2019, final U.S. tax regulations were issued that resulted in a $4.3 million increase to the previously calculated transition tax.
We evaluate the profitability of each tax-paying component on a historic cumulative basis and a forward-looking basis while performing this analysis.
These liabilities involve judgment and estimation and are monitored based on the best information available.
We recognized interest expense related to our unrecognized tax benefits of $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019.
We currently anticipate that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced by approximately $0.1 million within the next twelve months.
We generated revenue and net income from discontinued operations of $34.5 million and $6.3 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2019 related to our semiconductor cryogenics business as compared to $51.1 million and $17.8 million, respectively, for the corresponding period of fiscal 2018.
We generated revenue and net income from discontinued operations of $109.5 million and $20.7 million, respectively, for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 related to our semiconductor cryogenics business as compared to $148.2 million and $37.2 million, respectively, for the corresponding period of fiscal 2018.
The net income includes income from the Ulvac Cryogenics, Inc. joint venture during these periods.
Indirect expenses which supported the semiconductor cryogenics business, and which will remain as part of the continuing operations, are not reflected in income from discontinued operations.
We believe that we have adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, financing activities, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
The discussion of our cash flows and liquidity that follows does not include the impact of the disposition of the semiconductor cryogenics business and is stated on a total company consolidated basis.
Our cash is held in numerous locations throughout the world.
As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $156.9 million, of which $112.3 million was held outside of the United States.
As of June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we had marketable securities of $2.9 million and $53.5 million, respectively.
On July 1, 2019, subsequent to this third fiscal quarter reporting period, the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business was completed.
Cash received on July 1, 2019 was $669 million, of which, $3 million was placed in escrow.
The Company estimates obligations related to the sale include estimated closing costs of $13 million and estimated taxes of $105 million, resulting in estimated net proceeds from the sale of $550 million, subject to final working capital and other adjustments.
From the cash received on July 1, 2019 related to the sale, $348.3 million was applied to fully extinguish the balance of our incremental term loan and $147.0 million was applied to reduce the balance outstanding of our term loan.
The impact on the cash balance on July 1, 2019 due to the cash received from the sale partially offset by the application of the proceeds received to reduce debt, was a net increase of $173.4 million.
The Company expects to settle the other obligations from the sale including estimated closing costs of $13 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, and estimated taxes of $105 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
As described above, the Company routinely invests certain amounts of its cash balance in marketable securities.
When considering only the cash received related to the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business and the debt reductions made on July 1, 2019, as mentioned above, the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities reported as of June 30, 2019 on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $159.8 million increased $173.4 million to $333.2 million.
Similarly, the long-term debt reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019 of $534.7 million
decreased by $491.8 million on July 1, 2019 to $42.9 million and the current portion of long-term debt reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $6.3 million as of June 30, 2019 decreased to $2.8 million on July 1, 2019.
Total current liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2019 of $175.0 million increased on July 1, 2019 by approximately $118 million due to liabilities assumed related to the sale for the estimated tax payments of $105 million and estimated closing costs of $13 million, as mentioned above.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $159.8 million at June 30, 2019 as compared to $251.2 million at September 30, 2018.
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $91.5 million was primarily attributable to net cash outflows of $442.7 million to acquire GENEWIZ, cash dividends paid of $21.7 million and capital expenditures of $15.5 million, partially offset by net cash inflows primarily from proceeds received from the incremental amendment and syndication of our existing term loan of $331.4 million, proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $51.5 million and net cash inflows from operating activities of $58.2 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019.
Cash provided by operating activities was $58.2 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019, comprised primarily of earnings of $76.6 million, including net income of $25.1 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $51.5 million.
Partially offsetting these items were the uses of cash of $18.4 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
The changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in a use of cash consisted primarily of a decrease in accrued compensation and tax withholdings as a result of year-end cash incentive bonus payments, an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher revenue, an increase in inventory levels primarily related to our automation systems product lines, and increase in accounts payable.
Cash provided by operating activities was $42.8 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 comprised primarily of earnings of $95.0 million, including net income of $106.1 million and the unfavorable impact of non-cash related charges of $11.1 million, partially offset by the uses of cash of $52.2 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities as well as cash proceeds generated from sales and maturities of marketable securities.
Cash used in investing activities was $408.1 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $142.0 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 included cash outflow of $442.7 million for the acquisition of GENEWIZ, $15.5 million of capital expenditures, and $1.3 million for the purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by cash inflows from the proceeds of sales and maturities of marketable securities of $51.5 million.
Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 included cash payments of $83.0 million for acquisitions, $58.3 million for the purchases of marketable securities and $9.3 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by cash inflows from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $8.5 million.
Cash provided by financing activities was $309.8 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $176.4 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
In April 2019, we committed to construct a facility in Suzhou China, to consolidate the Suzhou operations of its GENEWIZ business and provide an infrastructure to support future growth.
The facility will be constructed in two phases.
During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we have incurred $0.1 million in capital expenditures related to the construction of this facility.
On July 1, 2019, we completed the sale of our semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group) for $675.0 million.
On July 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the sale, we used $348.3 million of the cash proceeds from the sale to extinguish the total remaining outstanding balance of the incremental term loan and $147.0 million of the cash proceeds from the sale to extinguish a portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan.
On October 4, 2017, we entered into a $200.0 million term loan with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.
The term loan was issued at $197.6 million, or 98.8% of its par value, resulting in a discount of $2.4 million, or 1.2%, which represented loan origination fees paid at the closing.
On November 15, 2018, we entered into an incremental amendment, or the Amendment to the existing credit agreement.
Under the Amendment, we obtained an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million.
The proceeds of the incremental loan were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of GENEWIZ acquisition.
Except as provided in the Amendment, the incremental loan is subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the existing credit agreement.
The loan principal amount may be increased by an aggregate amount equal to $75.0 million plus any voluntary repayments of the term loans plus any additional amount such that the secured leverage ratio of the Company is less than 3.00 to 1.00.
We wrote off the carrying value of the incremental term loan of $340.1 million as of February 15, 2019 and recorded the syndicated incremental term loan at its present value for $349.1 million and a loss on debt extinguishment for $9.1 million.
Except as provided in the Amendment for increase of interest rates, the incremental term loan was subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the incremental term loan.
Installment principal payments equal to 0.25% of the initial principal amount of the term loan are payable on the last day of each quarter, with any remaining principal amount becoming due and payable on the maturity date.
We would also be required to redeem the term loan at the principal amounts then outstanding upon the occurrence of certain events, as set forth in the original credit agreement and the Amendment.
On July 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the sale of our semiconductor cryogenics business, we used $348.3 million of the cash proceeds from the sales to extinguish the outstanding balance of the incremental term loan and $147.0 of the cash proceeds from the sales to extinguish a portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan.
At July 1, 2019, our total outstanding debt balance was approximately $46 million as a result of the debt extinguishment.
At June 30, 2019, we had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $1.7 million for the three five-year term loans.
The two one-year short term loans matured and were repaid in full as of June 30, 2019.
During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, we incurred aggregate interest expense of $21.3 million on the term loans including $1.3 million of deferred financing costs amortization.
Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded through our existing sources of liquidity and operating cash flows.
As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the credit agreement.
We maintain a revolving line of credit under a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
that provides for revolving credit facility of up to $75.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability, as defined in the credit agreement.
The proceeds from the line of credit are available for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes.
As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately $48.7 million available for borrowing under the line of credit.
There were no amounts outstanding pursuant to the line of credit as of June 30, 2019.
The credit agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, a financial covenant, affirmative and negative covenants, as well as events of default.
We were in compliance with the credit agreement as of June 30, 2019.
On July 31, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share payable on September 27, 2019 to common stockholders of record as of September 6, 2019.
We may reduce, delay or cancel a quarterly cash dividend based on the severity of a cyclical downturn.
On September 29, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to $50.0 million worth of our common stock.
There were no shares repurchased under this program during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and there have been no shares repurchased under this program since its inception.
Our non-cancellable inventory purchase commitments were $97.2 million at June 30, 2019.
At June 30, 2019, we had approximately $1.3 million of letters of credit outstanding related primarily to customer advances and other performance obligations.
These arrangements guarantee the refund of advance payments received from our customers in the event that the product is not delivered or warranty obligations are not fulfilled in accordance with the contract terms.
These obligations could be called by the beneficiaries at any time before the expiration date of the particular letter of credit if we fail to meet certain contractual requirements.
None of these obligations were called during the nine months ended June 30, 2019, and we currently do not anticipate any of these obligations to be called in the near future.
As of June 30, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
