 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
 We have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in Euros, British Pounds and a variety of Asian currencies. Sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were approximately 37% and 33% of our total sales, respectively, during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. These sales were made primarily by our foreign subsidiaries, which have cost structures that substantially align with the currency of sale.  
 In the normal course of our business, we have liquid assets denominated in non-functional currencies which include cash, short-term advances between our legal entities and accounts receivable which are subject to foreign currency exposure. Such balances were approximately $140.5 million and $84.7 million, respectively, at March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, and related to the Euro, British Pound and a variety of Asian currencies. We mitigate the impact of potential currency translation losses on these short-term intercompany advances by the timely settlement of each transaction, generally within 30 days. We also utilize forward contracts to mitigate our exposures to currency movement. We incurred foreign currency losses of $0.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively, during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, which related to the currency fluctuation on these balances between the time the transaction occurred and the ultimate settlement of the transaction. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates at March 31, 2019 and 2018 would result in an approximate change of $2.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in our net income during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
