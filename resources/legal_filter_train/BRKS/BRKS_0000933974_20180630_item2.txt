 We are a leading global provider of automation and cryogenic solutions for multiple applications and markets. We primarily serve the semiconductor capital equipment market and sample management market for the life sciences industry. Our leadership position and global support structure in each of these markets makes us a valued business partner to some of the world’s largest semiconductor capital equipment and device makers as well as pharmaceutical and life science companies and research institutions in the world. Our offerings are also applied to industrial capital equipment and other adjacent technology markets.  
 In the life sciences sample management market, we utilize our core competencies and capabilities in automation and cryogenics to provide comprehensive bio-sample management solutions to a broad range of end markets within the life sciences industry. Our offerings include automated ultra-cold storage freezers, consumable sample storage containers, instruments which assist in the workflow of sample management, and both complete on-site and off-site full sample management services. We expect the life sciences sample management market to remain one of our principal markets for our product and service offerings and provide favorable opportunities for the growth of our overall business. Over the past several years, we have acquired and developed essential capabilities required to strategically address the sample management needs across multiple end markets within the life sciences industry. In October 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of 4titude Limited, or 4titude, a U.K.-based manufacturer of scientific consumables for biological sample materials used in a variety of genomic and DNA analytical applications, for a total purchase price of $65.1 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition has expanded our existing offerings of consumables and instruments within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. In April 2018, we acquired BioSpeciMan Corporation, or BioSpeciMan, a Canadian provider of storage services for biological sample materials. We made a total cash payment of $5.2 million, net of cash acquired and subject to working capital adjustments. The acquisition is expected to expand customer relationships and geographic reach within our growing sample management storage services business. Please refer to Note 4, “Acquisitions” in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q for further information on these transactions. Since entering the life sciences industry, we have also strengthened and broadened our product portfolio and market reach by investing in internal product development and sales and marketing infrastructure. During 
fiscal years 2017 and 2016, more than 18% of our cumulative research and development spending was focused on innovating and advancing solutions while extending our reach into the life sciences sample management market. In fiscal year 2016, we commercialized the internally-developed Biostore III Cryo, an automated system which incorporates sample retrieval, archiving, monitoring, tracking, inventory control, and related enterprise systems connectivity with the industry’s leading cryogenic sample storage freezers. In fiscal year 2017, we launched BioStudies, a bioinformatics sample intelligence software platform that enables customers to manage their global samples. We expect to continue investing in research and development and making strategic acquisitions and other investments with the objective of expanding our offerings in the life sciences sample management market.   
 Results of Operations- Revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 increased to $620.1 million, or by 21%, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin was 40.1% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 37.8% for the nine months ended June 30, 2017, which resulted in an increase in gross profit of $55.6 million. Operating expenses were $177.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $146.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $31.0 million. Operating income was $71.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $46.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Revenue growth and gross margin improvement drove higher gross profits of $55.6 million, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Net income was $106.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $45.2 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $60.9 million was primarily attributable to the decrease in income taxes of $47.6 million driven by the substantial release of the tax valuation allowance of $45.6 million and an increase in operating income of $24.6 million. These increases were partially offset by higher net non-operating expenses of $11.3 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, primarily related to increased interest expense of $6.6 million mainly due to the term loan, higher foreign exchanges losses of $1.5 million and the impact of a $1.8 million gain recorded on the settlement of our investment in Biocision, LLC, or BioCision, during the nine months ended June 30, 2017. In addition, income from equity method investments decreased during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 by $2.3 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2017.   
 Cash Flows and Liquidity- Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $232.0 million at June 30, 2018 as compared to $104.3 million at September 30, 2017. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $127.7 million was primarily attributable to cash inflows related to proceeds from the term loan of $197.6 million and cash inflows of $42.8 million generated from our operating activities, partially offset by cash outflows related to business acquisitions of $83.0 million, dividend payments of $21.2 million, and capital expenditures of $9.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The $42.8 million of cash generated from operating activities during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 were comprised primarily of earnings of $95.0 million, including net income of $106.1 
million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $11.1 million, partially offset by uses of cash of $52.2 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions. Please refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below for a detailed discussion of our liquidity and changes in cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2017.   
 For a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to our unaudited consolidated financial statements, please refer to Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q.   
 We reported revenue of $223.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $181.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $41.8 million, or 23%. We reported revenue of $620.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $511.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $109.1 million, or 21%. We reported revenue growth in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and the Brooks Life Sciences segment for both periods. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected revenue by $4.0 million and $9.0 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.   
 Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported revenue of $173.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $145.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of 28.8 million, or 20%. Revenue for the segment was $474.4 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $406.2 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $68.1 million, or 17%. The increase in both periods were primarily driven by increases in sales of robotic automation products, cryogenic pump products and semiconductor services and related spare parts, partially offset by a decline in sales of contamination controls systems. 
 Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported revenue of $49.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $36.8 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $13.0 million, or 35%, was from internal growth of $5.3 million, principally in sample storage services, automated storage systems, service and maintenance and software. Additionally, the acquisitions of 4titude, Pacific Bio-Material Management, Inc. and Novare, LLC, or PBMMI, the web-based software platform acquired from RURO, Inc., or FreezerPro, and BioSpeciMan contributed incremental revenue of $7.6 million. Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported revenue of $145.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $104.8 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $40.9 million, or 39%, was primarily from internal growth of $20.4 million, principally in sample storage services, automated storage systems, consumables and instruments and software. Additionally, the acquisitions of 4titude, PBMMI, FreezerPro and BioSpeciMan, contributed incremental revenue of $20.5 million. Brooks Life Sciences internal revenue growth was favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rates by $0.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.  
 Revenue generated outside the United States was $139.0 million, or 62% of total revenue, for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $111.7 million, or 62% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Revenue generated outside the United States was $379.9 million, or 61% of total revenue, for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $338.1 million, or 66% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. We have one customer within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment that accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated revenue for both the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. We have one customer within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment that accounted for approximately 12% and 10% of our consolidated revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.   
 We reported gross margins of 39.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 39.4% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 0.6 percentage points and in the Brooks Life Sciences segment by 0.7 percentage points in the 2018 period over the 2017 period. We reported gross margins of 40.1% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 37.8% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 3.1 percentage points and 0.1 points in the Brooks Life Sciences segment in the 2018 period, as compared to the prior period. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 included $1.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $1.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 also included $0.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting, as compared to $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the purchasing accounting impact related to inventory step-up and the amortization of completed technology, gross margins expanded 0.9 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.  
 Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 40.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 40.1% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is driven by volume leverage of fixed costs partially offset by higher warranty expense. Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 41.2% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 38.1% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was driven by a favorable mix, volume leverage and lower costs related to materials. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 included $1.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $0.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The results for the three and 
nine months ended June 30, 2018 each included $0.7 million of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2017 included $0.1 million of such charges. Excluding the purchase accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 1.2 percentage points and 3.2 percentage points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.  
 Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 37.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 36.7% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was a result of volume leverage of fixed costs, the impact of higher margins of recent acquisitions, and favorable margins on consumables and instruments, partially offset by lower margins in automated storage systems and adverse mix. Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 36.6% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 36.4% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Margin improvement was mainly due to volume leverage of fixed costs and the impact of higher margins of recent acquisitions, offset by higher costs related to production and materials and adverse product mix. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 included $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $0.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 also included $1.2 million of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting. There were no such charges during the three months ended June 30, 2018. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017 included $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of such charges. Excluding the purchasing accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins increased 0.1 percentage points and 0.2 percentage points for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, respectively as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.   
 Research and development expenses were $14.2 million and $40.5 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $12.0 million and $34.1 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $2.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 reflects greater investments in the 2018 period of $1.4 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and $0.8 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. The increase of $6.4 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year reflects greater investments in the 2018 period of $3.7 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and $2.6 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. Higher research and development expenses during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the same periods of prior fiscal year were primarily attributable to higher employee related costs and project spending to support new product development and the growth of our business as well as research and development costs associated with new acquisitions made during the nine months ended June 30, 2018.   
 Restructuring charges were $0.1 million during both the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $0.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The charges during the three months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily related to severance in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. The charges during the nine months ended June 30, 2017 included $2.2 million in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment, $0.2 million in the Brooks Life Sciences segment and $0.3 million related to a company-wide restructuring action. Please refer to Note 15, “Restructuring and Other Charges” to our consolidated financial statements and “Restructuring Charges” of Item 7, “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on these restructuring actions.  
 Gain on settlement of equity method investment- During the nine months ended June 30, 2017, we recognized a gain of $1.8 million on the settlement of the equity method investment in BioCision which was included as a part of the non-cash consideration for an acquisition of Cool Lab, LLC, or Cool Lab, in November 2016. Please refer to Note 3, “Acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on this transaction.  
 Interest income- During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded interest income of $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, which represented income earned on our marketable securities.   
 Other expenses, net- During each of the three-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we recorded other expenses, net, of $0.3 million. During the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 we recorded other expenses, net of $2.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The $1.4 million increase was primarily attributable to higher foreign currency exchange losses of $1.5 million recognized during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Please refer to Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Currency Rate Exposure” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information about these currency exchange losses.   
 We recorded an income tax expense of $3.3 million and an income tax benefit of $37.7 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018. The tax provision for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by the income generated during the quarter. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by a discrete benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance against U.S. net deferred tax assets in the amount of $45.6 million. The tax benefit for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 also included $0.7 million of tax benefits related to the re-measurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to account for the reduced 21 
 We recorded an income tax provision of $3.7 million and $9.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017. The provision recorded during each period was primarily driven by foreign income. Tax provision during the nine months ended June 30, 2017 was partially offset by $0.9 million of tax benefits related to the reduction of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations.  
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) was enacted in the U.S., making significant tax law changes affecting the Company. The SEC has issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”), which has provided guidance for companies that have not completed the accounting for the income tax effects of Tax Reform. Under SAB 118, a company may report provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates where the accounting is incomplete. These amounts are subject to adjustments during a measurement period of up to one year beginning in the reporting period of the enactment date.  
 During the nine months ended June 30, 2017, we incurred losses of $0.5 million from our investment in BioCision which was settled during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 as a part of the non-cash consideration for the acquisition of Cool Lab in November 2016. We traditionally recorded the income and losses related to the equity method investment in BioCision one quarter in arrears. During the nine months ended June 30, 2017, we recorded two additional months of activity in the carrying value of the investment as a result of its settlement. We deemed the amount of $0.2 million related to two additional months of activity to be insignificant. Please refer to Note 3, “Acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements and “Equity in Earnings of Equity Method Investments” section of Item 7, “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on this transaction.   
 Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with substantial majority of those amounts located in the United States. As of June 30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $232.0 million, of which $81.3 million was held outside of the United States. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue withholding tax liabilities to repatriate these funds. As a result of recent changes in U.S. tax legislation, any repatriation in the future would not result in U.S. federal income tax. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current operating plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations. At June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had marketable securities of $52.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, which were held in the United States. Our marketable securities are generally readily convertible to cash without an adverse impact. We believe that our current cash balance, marketable securities portfolio and access to the revolving line of credit as well as to debt and capital markets along with cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital, financing activities, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.  
 On October 4, 2017, we entered into a $200.0 million Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, or the term loan, with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, or collectively, the lenders. The term loan was issued at $197.6 million, or 98.8% of its par value, resulting in a discount of $2.4 million, or 1.2%, which represented loan origination fees paid at the closing. We incurred additional deferred financing costs of $0.4 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018. At June 30, 2018, the outstanding term loan principal balance was $199.0 million, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs of $2.5 million. The loan proceeds will be used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2018, we had approximately $49.5 million available for borrowing under the line of credit. There were no amounts outstanding pursuant to the line of credit as of June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. The amount of funds available for borrowing under the line of credit arrangement may fluctuate each period based on our borrowing base availability. Please refer to the “Capital Resources” section below for further information on the term loan and the line of credit.   
 Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $232.0 million at June 30, 2018 as compared to $104.3 million at September 30, 2017. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $127.7 million 
was primarily attributable to cash inflows of $197.6 million related to proceeds from the term loan and cash inflows of $42.8 million generated from our operating activities, partially offset by cash outflows related to business acquisitions of $83.0 million, dividend payments of $21.2 million, and capital expenditures of $9.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018.   
 Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as earnings, working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and other operating charges impact reported cash flows.  
 Cash flows provided by operating activities were $42.8 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018, comprised primarily of earnings of $95.0 million, including net income of $106.1 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $11.1 million. Partially offsetting these items were the uses of cash of $52.2 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in a use of cash consisted primarily of an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher revenue, an increase in inventory levels to support the growth of our business and a decrease in accrued compensation and tax withholdings as a result of year-end cash incentive bonus payments. These uses of cash were partially offset by sources of cash related primarily to increases in accounts payable. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $61.4 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017 and comprised primarily of earnings of $68.3 million, including net income of $45.2 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $23.1 million. Partially offsetting these items were sources of cash of $6.9 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.   
 Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities as well as cash proceeds generated from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities was $141.9 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $9.0 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Cash used in investing activities of $141.9 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 included cash payments of $83.0 million for acquisitions, $58.3 million for the purchases of marketable securities and $9.3 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by cash inflows from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $8.5 million. Cash used in investing activities of $9.0 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017 included primarily $5.3 million for the acquisition of CoolLab and $6.8 million of capital expenditures, offset by $3.6 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities.  
  Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information technology infrastructure. Capital expenditures were $9.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $6.8 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.   
 On October 4, 2017, we entered into the $200.0 million term loan with the lenders. The term loan was issued at $197.6 million, or 98.8% of its par value, resulting in a discount of $2.4 million, or 1.2%, which represented loan 
origination fees paid at the closing. We incurred additional deferred financing costs of $0.4 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The loan proceeds are used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Please refer to Note 8, "Debt" in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" on this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on the term loan.  
 Borrowings under the term loan bear variable interest rates, at our option, based on either LIBOR, the federal funds effective rate or the prime rate plus an applicable percentage. As a result, we may experience exposure to interest rate risk due to the potential volatility associated with the variable interest rates on the term loan. If rates increase, we may be subject to higher costs of servicing the loan which could reduce our profitability and cash flows. During the nine months ended June 30, 2018, the weighted average stated interest rate on the term loan was 4.5%. During the nine months ended June 30, 2018, we incurred cash interest expense of $6.3 million on the term loan. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded through our existing sources of liquidity and operating cash flows.   
 The term loan agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. As of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the term loan agreement.  
 We maintain a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A that provides for revolving credit financing of up to $75.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability, as defined in the credit agreement. The line of credit matures on October 4, 2022. The proceeds from the line of credit are available for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Please refer to Note 7, "Line of Credit" in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" on this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on the terms and conditions of the line of credit.   
 As of June 30, 2018, we had approximately $49.5 million available for borrowing under the line of credit. There were no amounts outstanding pursuant to the line of credit as of June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. The amount of funds available for borrowing under the line of credit arrangement may fluctuate each period based on our borrowing base availability. The line of credit contains certain customary representations and warranties, a financial covenant, affirmative and negative covenants, as well as events of default. We were in compliance with the line of credit covenants as of June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. We believe we will be able to generate sufficient cash in the United States and foreign jurisdictions to fund future operating costs. We secured the revolving line of credit as an additional assurance for maintaining liquidity in the United States during potentially severe downturns of the cyclical semiconductor market, as well as for strategic investments and acquisitions.   
 On July 27, 2016, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to sell securities, including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, depositary shares, purchase contracts and purchase units in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering. Any such offering, if it does occur, may happen in one or more transactions. The specific terms of any securities to be sold will be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. This registration statement will expire on July 27, 2019.   
 On July 31, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.10 per share of our common stock. The total dividend of approximately $7.0 million will be paid on September 28, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 7, 2018. Dividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on actual cash flow from operations, our financial condition, debt service and capital requirements, and any other factors our Board of Directors may consider relevant. We intend to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future; however, the amount and timing of these dividends may be impacted by the cyclical nature of certain markets we serve. We may reduce, delay or cancel a quarterly cash dividend based on the severity of a cyclical downturn.  
 As of June 30, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.  
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
