 Results of Operations- Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased to $223.5 million, or by 23%, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Gross margin was 39.9% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to 39.4% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, which resulted in an increase in gross profit of $17.7 million.
Operating expenses were $62.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to $52.8 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of $9.7 million.
Net income was $22.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $17.4 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $5.3 million was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income of $7.9 million, partially offset by an increase in net non-operating expenses of $3.0 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, primarily related to interest expense on the term loan and lower income from equity method investments of $1.2 million.
 Results of Operations- Revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 increased to $620.1 million, or by 21%, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Gross margin was 40.1% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 37.8% for the nine months ended June 30, 2017, which resulted in an increase in gross profit of $55.6 million.

Operating income was $71.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $46.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase of $60.9 million was primarily attributable to the decrease in income taxes of $47.6 million driven by the substantial release of the tax valuation allowance of $45.6 million and an increase in operating income of $24.6 million.
These increases were partially offset by higher net non-operating expenses of $11.3 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, primarily related to increased interest expense of $6.6 million mainly due to the term loan, higher foreign exchanges losses of $1.5 million and the impact of a $1.8 million gain recorded on the settlement of our investment in Biocision, LLC, or BioCision, during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
In addition, income from equity method investments decreased during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 by $2.3 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
 Cash Flows and Liquidity- Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $232.0 million at June 30, 2018 as compared to $104.3 million at September 30, 2017.
The increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $127.7 million was primarily attributable to cash inflows related to proceeds from the term loan of $197.6 million and cash inflows of $42.8 million generated from our operating activities, partially offset by cash outflows related to business acquisitions of $83.0 million, dividend payments of $21.2 million, and capital expenditures of $9.3 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The $42.8 million of cash generated from operating activities during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 were comprised primarily of earnings of $95.0 million, including net income of $106.1
million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $11.1 million, partially offset by uses of cash of $52.2 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions.

The SEC has issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”), which has provided guidance for companies that have not completed the accounting for the income tax effects of Tax Reform.
Under SAB 118, a company may report provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates where the accounting is incomplete.
These amounts are subject to adjustments during a measurement period of up to one year beginning in the reporting period of the enactment date.
The toll charge is treated as an inclusion of the company’s accumulated foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income during the tax year ended September 30, 2018.
We have estimated that our accumulated foreign earnings are $120.0 million which is a provisional amount subject to the measurement period described in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118.
