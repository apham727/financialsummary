In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group), (the “Disposition”). The Company determined that the semiconductor cryogenics business met the “held for sale” criteria and the “discontinued operations” criteria in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205, Presentation of Financial Statements, (“FASB ASC 205”) as of September 30, 2018. The Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements were restated for all periods presented to reflect the discontinuation of the semiconductor cryogenics business, in accordance with FASB ASC 205. The discussion in the notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise noted, relate solely to the Company's continuing operations. Please refer to Note 3, “Discontinued Operations” for further information. 
On July 1, 2019, the Company completed the Disposition for $675.0 million, subject to adjustments for working capital and other items. The Company expects net cash proceeds from the sale to be approximately $550 million, after adjustments and deducting taxes and other items. In connection with the closing the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Asset Purchase Agreement with the purchaser. As part of this amendment, liabilities assumed by the purchaser were revised to include accounts payable related to the semiconductor cryogenics business. As of September 30, 2018, the Company has revised its accounts payable balance on a continuing operations basis to exclude accounts payable related to the semiconductor cryogenics business and revised its current liabilities held for sale balance to include accounts payable related to the semiconductor cryogenics business on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounts payable and total liabilities of the discontinued operation have also been revised in Note 3, “Discontinued Operations” below. As of September 30, 2018, the accounts payable balance related to the semiconductor cryogenics business was $11.1 million. The Company will also revise these balances in previously reported historical periods in the event those periods are presented in future filings. 
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company identified a misclassification related to the presentation of the product and service revenue and the cost of product and service revenue related to the GENEWIZ Group (“GENEWIZ”) in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 31, 2018. The total revenue and cost of revenue related to GENEWIZ for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were included in the product revenue and cost of product revenue line items instead of the service revenue and cost of 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Foreign currency exchange losses generated from the settlement and remeasurement of these transactions are recognized in earnings and presented within “Other expenses, net” in the Company’s unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses totaled $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and $1.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. 
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had no assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.
In May 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Targeted Transition Relief, which provides transition relief for entities adopting ASU 2016-13. The amendments in ASU 2019-05 allow entities to elect the fair value option on certain financial instruments. ASU 2019-05 amends ASU 2016-13 to allow companies to irrevocably elect, upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, the fair value option on financial instruments that were previously recorded at amortized cost and are within the scope of ASC 326-20 if the instruments are eligible for the fair value option under ASC 825-10. Entities are required to make this election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. ASU 2019-05’s amendments should be applied “on a modified-retrospective basis by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the statement of financial position as of the date that an entity adopted the amendments in ASU 2016-13.” Certain disclosures are required. For entities that have not adopted ASU 2016-13, the effective date of ASU 2019-05 will be the same as the effective date of ASU 2016-13 which is for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted if the entity has adopted ASU 2016-13. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU.
In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which makes targeted changes to standards on credit losses, hedging, and recognizing and measuring financial instruments to clarify them and address implementation issues. The amendments clarify the scope of the credit losses standard and address issues related to accrued interest receivable balances, recoveries, variable interest rates and prepayments, among other things. On recognizing and measuring financial instruments, the amendments address the scope of the guidance, the requirement for remeasurement under ASC 820 when using the measurement alternative, certain disclosure requirements and which equity securities have to be remeasured at historical exchange rates. The amendments in ASU 2019-04 related to ASU 2016-01 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted if the entity has adopted those standards. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU.
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842) - Codification Improvements, which makes targeted changes to lessor accounting and clarifies interim transition disclosure requirements. The targeted changes to the lessor accounting are not applicable to the Company because it is not in the industry to be targeted by the guidance. The ASU clarifies that companies are exempt from making the interim period transition disclosures required by ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, for the period in which a change in accounting principle is made as a result of adopting ASC 842. This interim period disclosure exemption is consistent with ASC 842, which already allowed companies to exclude the annual effect of the accounting change on income from continuing operations, net income and per-share amounts for periods post-adoption. This ASU is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU.
hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by these amendments. The provisions may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively. This ASU is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), which amends ASC 326 to add, remove, and clarify disclosure requirements related to credit losses of financial instruments. The new guidance introduces a new "expected loss" impairment model which applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities and other financial assets. Entities are required to estimate expected credit losses over the life of financial assets and record an allowance against the assets’ amortized cost basis to present them at the amount expected to be collected. Additionally, the guidance amends the impairment model for available for sale debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on such debt security is a credit loss. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The standard should be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company expects to adopt the guidance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial position and results of operations.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), an amendment of the FASB ASC. In accordance with the provisions of the newly issued guidance, a lessee should recognize at the inception of the arrangement a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability initially measured at the present value of lease payments over the lease term. For finance leases, interest on a lease liability should be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset, while for operating leases, total lease costs are recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying assets to forgo a recognition of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities and record a lease expense on a straight-line basis. Entities should determine at the inception of the arrangement whether a contract represents a lease or contains a lease which is defined as a right to control the use of identified property for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Additionally, entities should separate the lease components from the non-lease components and allocate the contract consideration on a relative standalone price basis in accordance with provisions of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 and should be adopted via a modified retrospective approach with certain optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The Company expects to adopt the guidance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial position and results of operations.
The Company adopted this standard effective October 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method and has only applied this method to contracts that were not completed as of the effective date and all new contracts initiated on or after the effective date. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with the governing revenue recognition standards applicable to that period. 
Upon adoption of ASC 606, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $0.9 million, net of a tax adjustment of $0.4 million, which resulted in an increase to the opening accumulated deficit balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily driven by deferral of previously recognized revenue within the Brooks Life Sciences segment, 
offset by deferral of previously recognized commission expense within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and acceleration of revenue within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. 
A portion of the adjustment related to the deferral of previously recognized revenue within the Brooks Life Science segment related to fees associated with registration of biological samples. This adjustment is derived from the new requirement to recognize revenue associated with certain sample life cycle management solutions transactions over time under ASC 606, while historically these transactions have been recorded at a point in time. Registration fees for these samples were previously recognized as revenue at a point in time upon completion of the registration and are now required to be recognized ratably over the period of benefit under ASC 606. As a result, upon adopting ASC 606, the Company deferred previously recognized registration fee revenue for contracts not completed as of the effective date. The period of benefit associated with registration fees has been determined to be approximately 24 months resulting in the deferral of revenue historically recognized at a point in time over this period. This change resulted in a decrease to accumulated deficit of $3.1 million as of October 1, 2018. 
Additional changes to the Company’s accumulated deficit were made as the result of adopting ASC 606. These changes, which resulted in a cumulative decrease to accumulated deficit of $0.2 million as of October 1, 2018, were driven by the identification of additional performance obligations as well as changes in the transfer of control of certain performance obligations across both the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group and Brooks Life Science segments. The additional changes to the Company’s accumulated deficit included a cumulative decrease to accumulated deficit of $0.2 million from discontinued operations. 
For further information with regard to the Company’s significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
On August 27, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group) (“Edwards”) for $675.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments. On July 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale for $675.0 million, subject to adjustments for working 
The semiconductor cryogenics business consists of the CTI pump business, Polycold chiller business, the related services business and the Company's 50% share in Ulvac Cryogenics, Inc., a joint venture based in Japan. The semiconductor cryogenics business was originally acquired by the Company in its 2005 merger with Helix Technology Corporation. The operating results of the semiconductor cryogenics business had been included in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment before the plan of disposition.
In connection with the closing of the Disposition on July 1, 2019, the Company and Edwards entered into a transition service agreement, a supply agreement, and lease agreements. The transition service agreement outlines the information technology, people, and facility support the Company will provide to Edwards for a period up to 9 months after transaction closing date. The supply agreement allows the Company to purchase CTI and Polycold goods at cost from Edwards up to an aggregate amount equal to $1.0 million during the one-year term after closing of the Disposition. The lease agreements provide facility space to Edwards free of charge for three years after the transaction closing date. Edwards will have the option to renew each lease at the then current market rates after the initial three-year lease term has ended. This Disposition is consistent with the Company’s long-standing strategy to increase shareholder value by accelerating the growth of its Life Sciences business with further acquisitions and strengthening its semiconductor automation business with opportunistic acquisitions.
The Disposition met the "held for sale" criteria and the “discontinued operation” criteria in accordance with FASB ASC 205 as of September 30, 2018. As such, its operating results have been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. 
The Company performed its fiscal year 2018 annual goodwill impairment analysis in April 2018. This analysis was updated upon announcement of entering into a definitive agreement for the Disposition for the year ended September 30, 2018. The Company concluded that there was no impairment indicator related to the goodwill of the semiconductor cryogenics business at either date the impairment analysis was performed. The Company did not include goodwill related to the semiconductor cryogenics business in its annual impairment analysis in April 2019, as the Disposition was classified as assets held for sale. 
The Company invests in marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale and records them at fair value in the Company’s unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Marketable securities reported as current assets represent investments that mature within one year from the balance sheet date. Long-term marketable securities represent investments with maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. The securities are valued using matrix pricing and benchmarking and classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are not actively traded. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted prices.
Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the security is sold or matures. Gains or losses realized from sales of marketable securities are computed based on the specific identification method and recognized as a component of "Other expenses, net" in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no sales of marketable securities during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018. There were no sales of marketable securities during the three months ended June 30, 2019. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, the Company sold marketable securities with a fair value and amortized cost of $49.4 million and $49.5 million, respectively, and recognized net losses of $0.1 million. As a result, during this period, the Company collected cash proceeds of $48.9 million from the sale of marketable securities and reclassified net unrealized holding losses of $0.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive income into "Other expenses, net" in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations as a result of these transactions.
Expected maturities could differ from contractual maturities because the security issuers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
Cash equivalents of less than $0.1 million and $50.6 million, respectively, at June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 consist of money market funds and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. 
On November 15, 2018, the Company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of GENEWIZ, a leading global genomics service provider headquartered in South Plainfield, New Jersey. GENEWIZ provides genomics services that enable research scientists to advance their discoveries within the pharmaceutical, academic, biotechnology, agriculture and other markets. It provides gene sequencing and synthesis services for more than 4,000 institutional customers worldwide supported by their global network of laboratories spanning the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. This transaction has added a new and innovative platform which the Company expects to leverage, along with its core capabilities, to add even more value to samples under the Company’s care. 
On the acquisition date, the Company paid $32.3 million to escrow accounts related to the satisfaction of the seller's indemnification obligations with respect to their representations and warranties and other indemnities. The Company also retained an amount equal to $1.5 million as collateral for any adjustment shortfall based on the final merger consideration calculation. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the final merger consideration was calculated to be $4.0 million less than the merger consideration paid at closing. To satisfy the shortfall, the Company reversed the $1.5 million liability associated with the holdback, received approval from the former shareholders to retain $0.7 million of funds the Company received on their behalf, and collected $1.8 million from the escrow accounts. 
The Company applied variations of the income approach to estimate the fair values of the intangibles assets acquired. The identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships (excess earnings method) of $125.5 million with a useful life of 14 years, completed technology (relief from royalty method) of $44.5 million with useful lives from 10 to 15 years and trademarks (relief from royalty method) of $19.1 million with a useful life of 13 years. The intangible assets acquired are amortized over the total weighted average period of 13.3 years using methods that approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company recorded a measurement adjustment related to the revised valuation of the intangible assets which increased intangible assets by $0.6 million. The additional amortization related to this adjustment was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2019. 
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company made a measurement period adjustment in the amount of $0.7 million to Prepaid expenses and other current assets and $0.7 million to Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The adjustment had no impact on goodwill.
The revenues and net income from GENEWIZ recognized in the Company's consolidated results of operations were $37.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The revenues and net income from GENEWIZ recognized in the Company’s consolidated results of operations were $86.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively for the reporting period since acquisition. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, and the period since acquisition, net income included $3.3 million and $8.2 million, respectively, related to amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. The Company incurred $3.8 million in transaction costs with respect to the GENEWIZ 
acquisition during fiscal year 2018. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, the Company incurred $0.1 million and $6.4 million, respectively, in transaction costs, which were recorded in "Selling, general and administrative" expenses within the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
The unaudited pro forma financial information presented in the table above has been adjusted to give effect to adjustments that are (1) directly related to the acquisition; (2) factually supportable; and (3) expect to have a continuing impact. These adjustments include, but are not limited to, the application of the Company’s accounting policies, elimination of related party transactions, depreciation and amortization related to fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and interest expense on acquisition related debt.
On April 6, 2018, the Company acquired approximately 93% of the outstanding capital stock of Tec-Sem Group AG (“Tec-Sem”), a Switzerland-based manufacturer of semiconductor fabrication automation equipment with a focus on reticle management. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company acquired the remaining 7% noncontrolling interest upon the completion of certain procedural steps. The total cash payment to acquire the business was $15.6 million, net of cash acquired and subject to working capital adjustments. The acquisition of Tec-Sem has expanded the Company’s contamination control solutions business within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. 
The Company applied variations of the income approach to estimate the fair values of the intangibles assets acquired. The identifiable intangible assets include completed technology (excess earnings method) of $8.4 million with a useful life of 10 years, backlog (excess earnings method) of $1.6 million with a useful life of 1 year, and customer relationships (distributor method) of $0.7 million with a useful life of 9 years. The intangible assets acquired are amortized over the total weighted average period of 8.6 years using methods that approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized. 
Goodwill of $7.7 million largely reflects the potential synergies and expansion of technical capabilities to the Company's existing contamination control solutions business. The goodwill from this acquisition is reported within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and is not tax deductible. 
As part of the acquisition, the Company assumed all the assets and liabilities of Tec-Sem’s Swiss defined benefit plan, which covered substantially all its full-time employees. At acquisition date, the plan was fully funded for each employee’s pension contribution plus an expected rate of return equal to the statutory discount rate. Total plan assets and plan liability were $5.1 million and $7.9 million, respectively, at acquisition date. The Company recorded a liability of $2.8 million for the unfunded projected benefit obligation related to each plan participant’s future services.
The Company reports the results of operations for Tec-Sem in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment starting from the acquisition date. The revenues and net income from Tec-Sem included in the Company's consolidated results for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $12.0 million and $4.4 million, respectively. The revenues and net income from Tec-Sem included in the Company's consolidated results for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 were $27.1 million and $7.0 million, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the net income included $0.5 million related to amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, the net income included $0.2 million related to the step-up in value of the acquired inventories and $2.2 million related to amortization expense of acquired intangible assets.
The escrow at closing had a balance of $2.6 million which consisted of $1.8 million related to satisfaction of the sellers' indemnification obligations with respect to their representations and warranties and other indemnities. The remaining $0.8 million of the escrow balance is related to a performance obligation that the Company assumed at the acquisition date for the transfer of non-core wafer stocker technology to an unrelated third party. The Company collected $0.4 million from the escrow related to the delivery of the technology during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. 
On October 5, 2017, the Company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of 4titude Limited (“4titude”), a U.K.-based manufacturer of scientific consumables for biological sample materials used in a variety of genomic and DNA analytical applications. The acquisition of 4titude has expanded the Company’s existing offerings of consumables and instruments within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. The aggregate purchase price of $65.1 million, net of cash acquired, consisted primarily of a cash payment of $64.8 million subject to working capital adjustments and the assumption of the seller’s liabilities of $0.4 million.
The Company applied variations of the income approach to estimate the fair values of the intangibles assets acquired. The identified intangible assets include customer relationships (excess earnings method) of $21.4 million with a useful life of 10 years, completed technology (relief from royalty method) of $5.2 million with a useful life of 13 years, backlog (excess earnings method) of $0.4 million with a useful life of 1 year and trademarks (excess earnings method) of $0.2 million with a useful life of 1 year. The intangible assets acquired are amortized over the total weighted average period of 10.4 years using methods that approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized. 
At the closing of the acquisition of 4titude, a cash payment of $0.4 million was placed into escrow which was ascribed to the purchase price. The escrow was related to potential working capital adjustments and the sellers’ satisfaction of general representations and warranties. 
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired and has been assigned to the Brooks Life Sciences segment. Goodwill is primarily the result of expected synergies from combining the operations of 4titude with the Company’s operations and is not deductible for tax purposes.
On April 20, 2018, the Company acquired BioSpeciMan Corporation (“BioSpeciMan”), a Canadian provider of storage services for biological sample materials. BioSpeciMan, founded in 2002, provides temperature controlled biological sample storage services to an attractive mix of pharma, biotech and contract lab customers. This acquisition has expanded customer relationships and geographic reach within its growing sample management storage services business in the Brooks Life Sciences segment. The total cash payment made by the Company was $5.2 million, net of cash acquired and subject to working capital adjustments. 
 The Company allocated the purchase price of $5.2 million based on the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date, which included $0.3 million of accounts receivable, $2.6 million of customer relationships, $2.7 million of goodwill and $0.7 million of assumed liabilities. The Company applied the excess earnings method, a variation of the income approach to determine the fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset. The goodwill from this acquisition is reported within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and is not tax deductible.
At the acquisition date, a cash payment of $0.5 million was held back for potential working capital adjustments and the sellers' satisfaction of general representations and warranties. These holdback payments were ascribed to the purchase price. 
Goodwill represents the excess of net book value over the estimated fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of a reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more often if impairment indicators are present at the reporting unit level. If events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce fair values of the reporting units below their carrying values, goodwill will be evaluated for impairment between annual tests. No triggering events indicating goodwill impairment occurred during the nine months ended June 30, 2019. 
The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment on April 1st of each fiscal year. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, the Company initially assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines, based on this assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, it performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. No impairment loss is recognized if the fair value of the reporting exceeds its carrying value. 
As of June 30, 2019, the Company completed the annual goodwill impairment test for its five reporting units, including Automation Solutions, Contamination Control Solutions and Global Semiconductor Services within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment, as well as Sample Management and GENEWIZ within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. Based on the test results, the Company determined that no adjustment to goodwill was necessary. The Company conducted a qualitative assessment for three reporting units within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and determined that it was more likely than not that their fair values were more than their carrying values. As a result of the analysis, the Company did not perform the quantitative assessment for these reporting units, and did not perform a quantitative analysis and, therefore, did not recognize any impairment losses. The Company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for the two reporting units within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. The Company determined that no adjustment to goodwill was necessary for these two reporting units. The 
Sample Management reporting unit’s fair value significantly exceeded book value. The GENEWIZ reporting unit, which was recently acquired, had a fair value slightly above its book value.
During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, the Company recorded a goodwill increase of $234.7 million primarily related to the acquisition of GENEWIZ, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments. Please refer to Note 5 "Acquisitions" for further information on this transaction.
Amortization expense for intangible assets was $26.2 million and $17.7 million, respectively, during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
7. Line of Credit
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had approximately $48.7 million available for borrowing under the line of credit. There were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit as of June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018. The Company records commitment fees and other costs directly associated with obtaining line of credit facility as deferred financing costs which are presented within "Other assets" in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred financing costs were $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, at June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018. Such costs are amortized over the term of the related facility arrangement and are included in “Interest expense” in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. The line of credit contains certain customary representations and warranties, a financial covenant and affirmative and negative covenants as well as events of default. The Company was in compliance with the line of credit covenants as of June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018. 
The Company’s obligations under the term loan are also guaranteed by BioStorage as the guarantor, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement. The Company and the guarantor granted the lenders a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and the guarantor to secure the repayment of the term loan.
The term loan matures and becomes fully payable on October 4, 2024. The principal is payable in installments equal to 0.25% of the initial principal amount of the term loans on March 31st, June 30th, September 30th and December 31st of each year, commencing on March 31, 2018, with any remaining amount of principal becoming due and payable on the maturity date. All accrued and unpaid interest on the term loan shall be due on the last day of each interest period elected by the Company for such borrowings, except for interest periods of more than three months in which case all accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable every three months.
Subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement, the Company may redeem the term loan at any time at its option without a significant premium or penalty, except for a repricing transaction, as defined in the credit agreement. The Company is required to redeem the term loan at the principal amount then outstanding upon occurrence of certain events, including (i) net proceeds received from the sale or other disposition of the Company’s or the guarantor’s assets, subject to certain limitations, (ii) casualty and condemnation proceeds received by the Company or the guarantor, subject to certain exceptions, (iii) net proceeds received by the Company or the guarantor from the issuance of debt or disqualified capital stock after October 4, 2017. Commencing on December 31, 2018, the Company was required to make principal payments equal to the excess cash flow amount, as defined in the credit agreement. Such prepayments are equal to 50% of the preceding year excess cash flow amount reduced by voluntary prepayments of the term loan, subject to certain limitations.
The deferred financing costs are accreted over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method and are included in “Interest expense” in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. At June 30, 2019, deferred financing costs were $5.8 million. 
The credit agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. If any of the events of default occur and are not waived or cured within applicable grace periods, any unpaid amounts under the credit agreement will bear an annual interest rate at 2.00% above the rate otherwise applicable under the terms and conditions of such agreement. The credit agreement does not contain financial maintenance covenants. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the credit agreement. 
On July 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the sale of its semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards, the Company used $348.3 million of the cash proceeds from the sale to extinguish the total remaining outstanding balance of the incremental term loan and $147.0 million of the cash proceeds from the sale to extinguish a portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan. The total amount of debt extinguished on July 1, 2019 was $495.3 million. Please refer to Note 17, “Subsequent Events”.
During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, the weighted average stated interest rate paid on all outstanding debt was 5.4%. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, the Company incurred aggregate interest expense of $21.3 million in connection with the borrowings, including $1.3 million of deferred financing costs amortization.
As of June 30, 2019, the estimated fair value of the outstanding principal balance of the debt on the Company’s balance sheet approximates its carrying value. The fair value was determined based on observable market inputs and classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy due to a lack of an active market for this term loan or a similar loan instrument.
10. Other Balance Sheet Information
Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $16.2 million and $15.0 million, respectively, at June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018.
At June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, the Company had cumulative capitalized direct costs of $9.1 million and $5.6 million, respectively, associated with the development of software for its internal use which are included within "Property, plant and equipment, net" in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, the Company capitalized direct costs of $2.6 million associated with the development of software for its internal use.
The Company establishes reserves for estimated costs of product warranties based on historical information. Product warranty reserves are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized, and retrofit accruals are recorded at the time retrofit programs are established. The Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the Company.
Among the total restricted stock units granted, 28,493 shares were granted to the employees who belong to the semiconductor cryogenics business that was classified as a discontinued operation during the nine months ended June 30, 2018. No shares were granted to the employees who belong to the semiconductor cryogenics business during the nine months ended June 30, 2019.
The stock awards granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors include restricted stock awards and deferred restricted stock units. 
Certain members of the Board of Directors have elected to defer receiving their annual awards of restricted stock units and related quarterly dividends until they attain a certain age or cease to provide services as the Company’s Board members. Restricted stock awards granted in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 are subject to a one-year vesting period, while the restricted stock awards granted in fiscal year 2019 were vested as of the grant date.
Performance-based restricted stock units are earned based on the achievement of performance criteria established by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. The criteria for performance-based awards have threshold, target and maximum performance goals. 
Performance-based awards granted in fiscal year 2019, 2018 and 2017 allow participants to earn 100% of restricted stock units if the Company’s performance meets its target goal for each applicable financial metric, and up to a maximum of 200% if the Company’s performance for such metrics meets or exceeds the maximum or stretch goal. Performance below the threshold financial metric results in award forfeiture. Performance goals for each plan will be measured over a three-year period for each plan and at the end of the period. Around the third anniversary of each plan’s grant date, the Company’s Board of Directors determines the number of units earned for participants who continue to meet the service requirements on the vest date.
The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $36.12 and $25.71, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $30.47 and $33.31, respectively. The fair value of restricted stock units vested during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $3.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively.

●Products, including sales of tool automation and automated cold sample management systems, atmospheric and vacuum robots, contamination control solutions, as well as consumables and spare parts.
●Identify the contract with a customer. Contracts are accounted for when approval and commitment has been received from both parties, the rights of each party are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration to which the Company is entitled is probable. Contracts are generally evidenced through receipt of an approved purchase order or execution of a binding arrangement. Within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment, contracts are typically short-term with the exception of service-type warranty contracts, which generally have a stated contract term that is greater than one year. Within the Brooks Life Sciences segment, contracts are both short and long-term. Long-term contracts within this segment relate to the sale of products with attached service-type warranty contracts that generally have a stated contract term that is greater than one year. Contracts within both operating segments may contain acceptance provisions where the Company is required to obtain technical acceptance from the customer upon completion of installation services and evidence of the systems functional performance within the customer’s operating environment. The Company has concluded that acceptance criteria within its contracts can be objectively evaluated and will not impact the Company’s transfer of control assessment under ASC 606. 
●Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations include the sale of products and services. Certain customer arrangements related to the sale of automated cold sample management systems and contamination control solution products generally include more than one performance obligation and may include a combination of goods and or services, such as products with installation services or service-type warranty obligations. These contracts include multiple promises and as a result, the Company is required to evaluate each promise and determine whether the promise qualifies as a performance obligation within the contract. Contracts may contain the option to acquire additional products or services at defined prices. The Company reviews the pricing of these options to determine whether the option would exist independently of the current contract. If the pricing of contract options provides a material right to the customer that it would not receive without entering into the current contract, the Company accounts for the option as a separate performance obligation. 
●Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For customer contracts that contain more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the total transaction consideration to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation within the contract. The Company relies on either observable standalone sales or an expected cost plus margin approach to determine the standalone selling price of offerings, depending on the nature of the performance obligation. Performance obligations whose standalone selling price is estimated using an expected cost plus margin approach relate to the sale of customized automated cold sample management systems and service-type warranties within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. 
Revenue from the sales of certain products that involve significant customization, which include primarily automated cold sample management systems is recognized over time as the asset created by the Company’s performance does not have alternative use to the Company and an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date is present. The Company recognizes revenue as work progresses based on a percentage of actual labor hours incurred on the project to-date and total estimated labor hours expected to be incurred on the project. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment. The Company has concluded that using the percentage of labor hours incurred to estimated labor hours needed to complete the project most appropriately depicts the Company’s efforts towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. The Company develops profit estimates for long-term contracts based on total revenue expected to be generated from the project and total costs anticipated to be incurred in the project. These estimates are based on a number of factors, including the degree of required product customization and the work required to be able to install the product in the customer’s existing environment, as well as the Company’s historical experience, project plans and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the contract related to implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within the Company’s control. The Company estimates a loss on a contract by comparing total estimated contract revenue to the total estimated contract costs and recognizes a loss during the period in which it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews profit estimates for long-term contracts during each reporting period and revises the estimate based on changes in circumstances. Revenue for certain arrangements that involve significant product customization but do not provide the customer with an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date are recognized at a point in time, upon completion or substantial completion of the project, provided transfer of control has occurred. The project is considered substantially complete when the Company receives acceptance from the customer and remaining tasks are perfunctory or inconsequential and in control of the Company. Generally, the terms of long-term contracts provide for progress billings based on completion of milestones or other defined phases of work. In certain instances, payments collected from customers in advance of recognizing the related revenue are recorded and presented as contract liabilities within “Deferred revenue” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, due to certain billing constraints within contracts, the customer may retain a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract. In these contracts, revenue recognized may exceed billings, which the Company presents as a contract asset on the balance sheet, which is included within the “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Accounts Receivable, Net. Accounts receivable represent rights to consideration in exchange for products or services that have been transferred by the Company, when payment is unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payment is due. Accounts receivable do not bear interest and are recorded at the invoiced amount. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts representing its best estimate of probable credit losses related to its existing accounts receivable and their net realizable value. The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a number of factors, including an evaluation of customer credit worthiness, the age of the outstanding receivables, economic trends and historical experience. Accounts receivable, net were $163.1 million and $125.2 million at June 30, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively.
Contract Assets. Contract assets represent rights to consideration in exchange for products or services that have been transferred by the Company, when payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. These amounts typically relate to contracts within the Brooks Life Sciences segment where the right to payment is not present until completion of the contract or the achievement of specified milestones and the value of the products or services transferred exceed this constraint. Contract assets are classified as current. Contract asset balances which are included within “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, were $5.2 million and $8.2 million at June 30, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively.
Deferred Commissions. Deferred commissions represent a direct and incremental cost of obtaining a contract. These amounts primarily relate to sales commissions within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and are deferred and amortized over a 60 month period, which represents the average period of contract performance. The Company classifies deferred commissions as noncurrent as the original amortization period of this asset is greater than one year. Deferred commissions balances are included within “Other assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred commissions were $0.9 million and $1.5 million at June 30, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively. The Company recorded $0.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of amortization expense related to deferred commissions for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019.
The Company capitalizes sales commissions when incurred if they are (i) incremental costs of obtaining a contract, (ii) expected to be recovered and (iii) have an expected amortization period that is greater than one year. As part of the Company’s cumulative effect adjustment, incremental costs associated with obtaining a contract were capitalized and have been classified as deferred commissions within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts 
The Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment provides a variety of products, services and solutions that enable improved throughput and yield in controlled operating environments, as well as an extensive range of support services. The solutions include atmospheric and vacuum robots, robotic modules, tool automation systems, contamination control of wafer and reticle carriers and reticle management systems. The support services include repair services, diagnostic support services, and installation services in support of the products, which enable the customers to maximize process tool uptime and productivity. This segment also provides end-user customers with spare parts and productivity enhancement upgrades to maximize tool productivity. 
The Brooks Life Sciences segment provides comprehensive life cycle sample management solutions to life science and bioscience customers including complete end-to-end “cold chain of custody” solutions and a variety of sample-based lab services such as genomic sequencing and gene synthesis to advance scientific research and support drug development. The segment’s product offerings include automated cold sample management systems for compound and biological sample storage, equipment for sample preparation and handling, consumables, and informatics that help customers manage samples throughout their research discovery and development work flows. The segment’s service offerings include sample storage, genomic sequencing, gen synthesis, lab processing services, lab analysis, and other support services provided to a wide range of life science customers, including pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, biorepositories and research institutes.
In conjunction with the acquisition of GENEWIZ during the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the Company reassessed Brooks segment reporting structure and determined that GENEWIZ represents a separate operating segment based on ASC 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”). As permitted by ASC 280, the Company elected to aggregate the Sample Management operating segment and the GENEWIZ operating segment as a single reportable segment titled Brooks Life Sciences. The aggregation was based on similarities in long-term forecasted economic characteristics, particularly adjusted operating income, similarity in services they offer, the customers they serve, the nature of their service delivery models, and their regulatory environments. The Company believes that the aggregated presentation is more useful to investors and other financial users. Management formally assesses the long-term financial outlook of its operating segments on an annual basis as part of its strategic planning process and more frequently on an informal basis. The customer bases of the operating segments overlap, serving life science and bioscience customers in the pharmaceutical and bio-technology companies as well as academic and government institutions. Both of these operating segments provide services relating to the biological samples needed to advance non-clinical and clinical research, 
serving scientific and business operations functions. In a typical customer workflow, a biological sample is collected, processed and analyzed with results interpreted and used to make scientific judgements. Critical or valuable samples are then annotated and stored for many years in environments where they can be easily retrieved for additional study. These operating segments provide services across this workflow. Both of these operating segments offer services meeting the standards of Good Manufacturing Practices set forth by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The Company had no customer that accounted for 10% or more of its consolidated revenue during each of the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. As of June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, the Company had no customers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total receivables.
For purposes of determining the percentage of revenue generated from any of the Company’s original equipment manufacturer (the "OEM") customers, the Company does not include revenue from products sold to contract manufacturer customers who in turn sell to the OEMs. If the Company included revenue from products sold to contract manufacturer customers supporting the Company’s OEM customers, the percentage of the Company’s total revenue derived from certain OEM customers would be higher.
