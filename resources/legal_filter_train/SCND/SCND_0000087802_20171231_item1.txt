 The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs.
 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
 Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
 Level 3 - Prices or valuation that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
 In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments.
These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties.
The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.
 The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria.
The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables.
Cost of work-in-process and finished goods inventories include material, labor, and manufacturing overhead.
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisitions.
 Total amortization expense was $61,100 and $76,200 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $122,200 and $154,100 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
As of December 31, 2017, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $124,700 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, $185,800 for fiscal 2019, $65,400 for fiscal 2020, $48,000 for fiscal 2021, $27,000 for fiscal 2022, and $7,400 thereafter.
