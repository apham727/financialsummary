 The Company records revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended” (“ASC Topic 606”).
 The following table summarizes the Company’s disaggregation of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
 Benchtop Laboratory Equipment sales are comprised primarily of standard benchtop laboratory equipment from its stock to laboratory equipment distributors, or to end users primarily via e-commerce.
Customers either pay by credit card (online sales) or net 30-90, depending on the customer.
The standard warranty is typically comprised of one to two years of parts and labor and is deemed immaterial.
Some contracts call for training and installation, which is considered ancillary and not a material part of the contract.
Due to the size and nature of the instruments, the Company subjects the instruments to an extensive factory acceptance testing process prior to shipment to ensure that they are fully operational once they reach the customer’s site.
Normally, the Company warrantees its instruments for a period of twelve months for parts and labor which normally consists of replacement of small components or software support.
Catalyst research instruments are never returned for repairs.
During the year, the Company’s management uses its best judgement to estimate the royalty revenues earned during the period.
 Approximately 36% and 49% of net sales of Benchtop Laboratory Equipment for the three month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories.
Approximately 33% and 25% of total Benchtop Laboratory Equipment sales were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
  For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, three customers accounted for approximately 23% (both periods) of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (18% and 19% of the Company’s total revenues).
Sales to two customers during the three months ended September 30, 2019 accounted for approximately 90% of the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations revenues and 6% of the Company’s total revenues.
Sales to three customers during the three months ended September 30, 2018 accounted for approximately 83% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations’ revenues and 9% of the Company’s total revenues.
 The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs.
 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
 Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments.
The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.
 The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria.
The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables.
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisitions.
Goodwill amounted to $705,300 at September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
 Total amortization expense was $19,500 and $61,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As of September 30, 2019, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $51,000 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending, June 30, 2020, $54,300 for fiscal 2021, $31,700 for fiscal 2022, $15,000 for fiscal 2023 and $10,900 for fiscal 2024.
 On July 1, 2019 the Company adopted the new accounting pronouncement as it relates to its leases which requires a lessee to recognize all long-term leases on its balance sheet as a liability for its lease obligation, measured at the present value of lease payments not yet paid, and a corresponding asset representing its right to use the underlying asset over the lease term and expands disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements.
  The Company leases certain properties consisting principally of a facility in Bohemia, New York (headquarters) through February 2025, a facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for its Catalyst Research Instrument Operations through November 2020 and another facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for its Bioprocessing Systems Operations through November 2020.
In addition, the Company had a lease for its Torbal Division of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations which was mutually terminated early effective as of October 31, 2019 and a new lease for a similar sales and administration office was entered into as of November 1, 2019 through October 2022.
All of the Company’s leases are deemed operating leases.
  The Company determines whether an agreement contains a lease at inception based on the Company’s right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and its right to direct the use of the identified asset.
Lease liabilities represent the present value of future lease payments and the Right-Of-Use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use the underlying assets for the respective lease terms.
The ROU asset is further adjusted to account for previously recorded lease expenses such as deferred rent and other lease liabilities.
As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate of 5.0% as the discount rate to calculate the present value of future lease payments, which was the interest rate that its bank would charge for a similar loan.
  The Company elected not to recognize a ROU asset and a lease liability for leases with an initial term of twelve months or less.
The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees.
  The Company elected available practical expedients for existing or expired contracts of lessees wherein the Company is not required to reassess whether such contracts contain leases, the lease classification or the initial direct costs.
The Company is not utilizing the practical expedient which allows the use of hindsight by lessees and lessors in determining the lease term and in assessing impairment of its ROU assets.
The Company utilized the transition method allowing entities to only apply the new lease standard in the year of adoption.
  As of September 30, 2019, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating lease liabilities was approximately 4 years and the weighted-average discount rate was 5.0%.
Total cash payments under these leases were $68,400, of which $68,300 was recorded as leases expense.
