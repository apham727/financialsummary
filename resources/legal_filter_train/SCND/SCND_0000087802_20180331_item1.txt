 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption of the update is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the new standard.
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”.
This update provides guidance on how to record eight specific cash flow issues.
This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements.
 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
 On December 22, 2017, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
The Company is a fiscal-year end taxpayer and is required to use a blended statutory federal tax rate, inclusive of the Federal rate change enacted on December 22, 2017 to compute its effective rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017.
The various provisions under the 2017 Tax Act most relevant to the Company have been considered in the preparation of the financial statements as of March 31, 2018.
The Company estimates it will record a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $30,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 due to an estimated reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the Federal tax rate.
We expect to complete our accounting during the one year measurement period from the enactment date.

 The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs.
 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
 Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
 Level 3 - Prices or valuation that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
 In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments.
The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.
 The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria.
The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables.
Cost of work-in-process and finished goods inventories include material, labor, and manufacturing overhead.
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisitions.
 Total amortization expense was $61,200 and $69,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $183,400 and $224,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
As of March 31, 2018, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $60,200 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, $185,800 for fiscal 2019, $65,400 for fiscal 2020, $48,000 for fiscal 2021, $27,000 for fiscal 2022, and $12,800 thereafter.
