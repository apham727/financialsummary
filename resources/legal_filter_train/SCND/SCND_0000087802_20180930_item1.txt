 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Scientific Industries, Inc., Altamira Instruments, Inc. (“Altamira”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, and Scientific Bioprocessing, Inc. (“SBI”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, and Scientific Packaging Industries, Inc., an inactive wholly-owned subsidiary (all collectively referred to as the “Company”).
All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
Early adoption of the update is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”.
This update provides guidance on how to record eight specific cash flow issues.
This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
  Trade accounts receivable, current of $67,100 and $278,200, and trade accounts receivable, long term of $245,400 for both periods were reclassified to contract assets, current; and contract assets, less current portion, respectively, on the balance sheet as of September 30, and June 30, 2018.
Customer advances were reclassified to contract liabilities as of September 30, and June 30, 2018.
In addition the Company’s Bioprocessing Systems Operations’ revenues are comprised of royalty revenues.
All revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation(s) under the contract (either implicit or explicit) by transferring the promised product or service to its customer either when (or as) its customer obtains control of the product or service.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation.
 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products or providing services.
As such, revenue is recorded net of returns, allowances, customer discounts, and incentives.
 Approximately 49% and 46% of net sales of benchtop laboratory equipment for the three month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories.
There was no significant customer sale during the three months ended September 30, 2017.
 The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs.
 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments.
The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.
 The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria.
The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables.

 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisitions.
Goodwill amounted to $705,300 at September 30, 2018 and June 30, 2018, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
 Total amortization expense was $61,000 and $61,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
As of September 30, 2018, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $125,900 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, $66,400 for fiscal 2020, $49,100 for fiscal 2021, $26,100 for fiscal 2022, $9,800 for fiscal 2023, and $1,600 thereafter.

The benchtop laboratory equipment sales reflected $425,300 of Torbal brand product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $304,200 in the three months ended September 30, 2017 as a result of continued growth in sales of the new force gauges product line.
Sales of catalyst research instruments increased by $188,800 to $217,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $28,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 because there were no large orders shipped during the prior year period.

 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2018 amounted to $416,500 compared to $428,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 due to various minor decreases in expenses for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations and the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations.
 Selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $35,100 (17.5%) to $236,100 from $201,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 primarily due to increased sales and marketing activities by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations.
 Research and development expenses decreased by $11,700 (9.1%) to $117,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $129,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily because of reduced new product development activities in the current year period for benchtop laboratory equipment.
 Total other income was $1,800 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $300 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, due primarily to unrealized holding gains on equity securities.
 The Company reflected income tax expense of $35,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to a tax benefit of $73,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to the income generated during the three months ended September 30, 2018.

Net cash used in investing activities was $4,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $41,500 used during the three months ended September 30, 2017 principally due to new capital equipment purchased during the prior year period by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations.
The Company used $1,600 in financing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $144,300 in the three months ended September 30, 2017 due to the contingent consideration paid in the prior year period.
