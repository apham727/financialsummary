The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ.
 The wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented and is comprised of several national distributors.
In addition, many manufacturers sell direct.
Consolidation of larger wireless carriers has and will most likely continue to impact our current and potential customer base.
We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, industry experience and knowledge, and our large customer base and purchasing relationships with approximately 440 manufacturers, provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the marketplace.
 Total Revenues.
Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 4.1% compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Revenues in our public carrier market increased by 47.9%.
This growth was primarily driven by our ability to expand market share with Tier 1 Carrier installers and contractors.

The annual federal rate has dropped from 35% to 21% due to the Tax Act.
Net income increased 72.2% and diluted earnings per share increased 68.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding prior-year quarter.

Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased 7.1% compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2018.

We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation.
We incurred bad debt expense of $1,499,700 and $433,200 for the nine months ended December 30, 2018 and December 24, 2017, respectively.
We experienced several atypical bad debt events during fiscal year 2019 thus far, which have resulted in a higher than usual fiscal year 2019 year to date bad debt expense.
In addition, our bad debt expense for the same prior year period was unusually low, which affects the comparison.
Increased focus on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers has required us to maintain increased inventory and accounts receivable levels, and at times has resulted in increased borrowings and interest expense under our secured Revolving Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).

As such, on October 19, 2017 we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as discussed below, based upon our then anticipated borrowing and cash needs.
expenditures of $2.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Cash used in both periods was due to capital expenditures largely comprised of investments in information technology.
 Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 million for the first nine months of both fiscal 2019 and 2018.
We utilized our asset based secured Revolving Credit Facility during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, leading to a cash inflow of $6.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively, during those periods.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, we had cash outflows of $5.1 million and $5.0 million, respectively, due to cash dividends paid to shareholders.
 On October 19, 2017, the Company and its primary operating subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the Company’s primary lenders.
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement for the secured Revolving Credit Facility previously established in June 2016, was amended and restated in order to, among other things, increase the Company’s borrowing limit from up to $35 million to up to $75 million.
In addition to expanding the borrowing limit, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement extends the applicable maturity date to October 19, 2021.
As of December 30, 2018, we had a $16.9 million balance on the secured Revolving Credit Facility; therefore, we had $58.1 million available, subject to the Borrowing Base limitations and compliance with the other applicable terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the financial and other covenants discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

The term loan is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of $2,300, with the balance due at maturity on April 1, 2019.
At December 30, 2018, the principal balance of this term loan was $9,200.
 We have made quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock since the third quarter of fiscal 2010.

On January 23, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.20 per share, payable on February 27, 2019 to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2019.
 Any future declaration of dividends and the establishment of any corresponding record and payment dates remains subject to further determination from time to time by the Board of Directors.
 We believe that our existing cash, payments from customers and availability under our secured Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to support our operations for at least the next twelve months.
