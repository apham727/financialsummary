 Our third quarter fiscal 2019 revenue increased by 4.1% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We experienced third quarter fiscal 2019 revenue growth within our commercial segment of 7.8% and a decrease in revenue in the retail segment of 2.1%, as compared to the third fiscal quarter of 2018. The growth in our commercial segment was driven by an increase in our public carrier market related to increased sales to Tier 1 carriers and associated contractors. For the retail segment, revenue decreased due, in part, to the decline in lower consumer traffic in retail stores and a decrease in Ventev mobile device accessory sales. Among our product categories, revenue increased in our base station infrastructure category by 18.7%.   
 Our third quarter fiscal year 2019 gross profit increased by 4.7%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the increase in revenue discussed above. Gross margin for the third quarter fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 was 20.4% and 20.2%, respectively. The improvement in gross margin was a result of lower freight expenses and improved profitability in our non-public carrier sales. Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the third quarter fiscal year 2019 were up 
0.3% compared to the third quarter fiscal year 2018. The increase is related to increased corporate support expense, information technology expense, and compensation expense, and was offset by a decrease in marketing expense and benefit expense. As a result of the factors discussed above, net income increased by 72.2% and diluted earnings per share increased by 68.4% compared to the prior-year quarter.  
 Total Revenues. Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 4.1% compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Revenues in our public carrier market increased by 47.9%. This growth was primarily driven by our ability to expand market share with Tier 1 Carrier installers and contractors. The growth in our public carrier market was partially offset by a 2.1% and 5.4% decline in sales to the retail market and the value-added resellers and integrators market.  
 Total Gross Profit. Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by 4.7% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Overall gross profit margin increased slightly from 20.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to 20.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases were primarily due to lower freight expenses and to improved profitability within our non-public carrier markets. Within our commercial segment, gross profit in our public carrier market increased by 44.2%. Gross profit in our value-added resellers and integrators market decreased by 0.4%. Within our retail segment, gross profit increased by 0.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 2018.   
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $81,600 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 18.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, to 18.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were consistent as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, despite the 4.1% increase in sales. There was an increase of $0.5 million in corporate support expense, primarily related to bad debt expenses, an increase of $0.3 million in information technology infrastructure to support our sales initiatives, and an increase of $0.2 million in compensation and benefits expense, during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. These increases were offset by the $0.9 million decrease in marketing expense.  
 We continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation. We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation. We incurred bad debt expense of $478,400 and $185,300 for the three months ended December 30, 2018 and December 24, 2017, respectively.   
 Interest, Net. Net interest expense increased from $114,500 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to $247,900 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Increased focus on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers has required us to maintain increased inventory and accounts receivable levels, and at times has resulted in increased borrowings and interest expense under our secured Revolving Credit Facility (discussed 
in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). We expect this higher level of interest expense to continue for at least the next several quarters.   
 Income Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share. The effective tax rate decreased from 24.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to 16.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was lower primarily due to a change in tax law and a reduction in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, due to a lapse in the related statute of limitations. The annual federal rate has dropped from 35% to 21% due to the Tax Act. Net income increased 72.2% and diluted earnings per share increased 68.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding prior-year quarter.   
 Total Gross Profit. Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased by 5.0% compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Within our commercial segment, gross profit in our public carrier market and our value-added resellers and integrators market increased by 35.2% and 1.6%, respectively, for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018. This growth in our commercial segment was partially offset by a decrease in our retail segment by 1.0%. Overall gross profit margin decreased from 20.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 to 20.2% for the first nine months of fiscal 2019. This decline was primarily caused by a change in customer mix, including the increase in lower margin sales in the public carrier market.   
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 19.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, to 18.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2019.  
 Information technology expense increased $1.4 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018. We continue to invest in our information technology infrastructure to support our sales initiatives.  
 We continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation. We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation. We incurred bad debt expense of $1,499,700 and $433,200 for the nine months ended December 30, 2018 and December 24, 2017, respectively. We experienced several atypical bad debt events during fiscal year 2019 thus far, which have resulted in a higher than usual fiscal year 2019 year to date bad debt expense. In addition, our bad debt expense for the same prior year period was unusually low, which affects the comparison.   
 Interest, Net. Net interest expense increased from $339,600 for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 to $667,100 for the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Increased focus on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers has required us to maintain increased inventory and accounts receivable levels, and at times has resulted in increased borrowings and interest expense under our secured Revolving Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). We expect this higher level of interest expense to continue for at least the next several quarters.  
 Income Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share. The effective tax rate decreased from 36.9% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 to 22.1% for the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was lower primarily due to a change in tax law. The annual federal rate has dropped from 35% to 21% due to the Tax Act. Our provision for income taxes decreased by 38.9% compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of reduced tax rate. Net income increased by 25.5% and diluted earnings per share increased 22.9% for the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018.  
 The following table summarizes our cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended December 30, 2018 and December 24, 2017.  
 Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $7.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018. This fiscal 2019 inflow was driven by net income plus depreciation and amortization, and partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory. Increasing sales to our public carrier customers at times requires significant investments in inventory, and at times results in larger accounts receivable balances. Both current and potential opportunities within our public carrier business have required an increase in working capital investments. As such, on October 19, 2017 we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as discussed below, based upon our then anticipated borrowing and cash needs.  
expenditures of $2.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Cash used in both periods was due to capital expenditures largely comprised of investments in information technology.   
 On October 19, 2017, the Company and its primary operating subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the Company’s primary lenders. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement for the secured Revolving Credit Facility previously established in June 2016, was amended and restated in order to, among other things, increase the Company’s borrowing limit from up to $35 million to up to $75 million. In addition to expanding the borrowing limit, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement extends the applicable maturity date to October 19, 2021. As of December 30, 2018, we had a $16.9 million balance on the secured Revolving Credit Facility; therefore, we had $58.1 million available, subject to the Borrowing Base limitations and compliance with the other applicable terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the financial and other covenants discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
 We have made quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Our most recent quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share was paid in November 2018. On January 23, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.20 per share, payable on February 27, 2019 to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2019.   
 Any future declaration of dividends and the establishment of any corresponding record and payment dates remains subject to further determination from time to time by the Board of Directors.   
 We believe that our existing cash, payments from customers and availability under our secured Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to support our operations for at least the next twelve months. To minimize interest expense, our policy is to apply excess available cash to reduce the balance outstanding from time to time on our secured Revolving Credit Facility. Our increased focus over the past several quarters on business

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  
 The Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the period covered by this quarterly report, there have been no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to 
materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
