 TESSCO architects and delivers innovative product and value chain solutions to support wireless broadband systems.
The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ.
also be affected by wireless carrier consolidation or the overall global economic environment.
 The wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented and is comprised of several national distributors.
In addition, many manufacturers sell direct.
Consolidation of larger wireless carriers has and will most likely continue to impact our current and potential customer base.
We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, industry experience and knowledge, and our large customer base and purchasing relationships with approximately 400 manufacturers, provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the marketplace.
 Total Revenues.
Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased 10.6% compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Revenues in our public carrier market, value-added resellers and integrators market and retail market decreased by 1.3%, 6.1% and 24.1%, respectively.
The decline in the retail segment was driven by significantly lower revenues from one of our more significant retail customers following its acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, change in business model and subsequent transition of its business elsewhere, as well as ongoing overall market softness.
Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased by 16.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Overall gross profit margin decreased from 19.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to 18.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
Within our commercial segment, gross profit margin in our public carrier market increased from 12.0% to 12.4% due to changes in customer mix.
Gross profit margin in our value-added resellers and integrators market decreased from 24.6% to 23.8%.
Agreements or arrangements on which these relationships are based typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale, are of limited duration, and are terminable by either party upon relatively short notice.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $3.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 18.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, to 18.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020.

Increased focus on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers has required us to maintain increased inventory levels, and at times has resulted in increased borrowings and interest expense under our secured Revolving Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).
We expect this higher level of interest expense to continue for at least the next several quarters.
 Income Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share.
The effective tax rate increased from 28.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to 90.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
The increase in the effective tax rate is the result of permanent and other tax adjustments remaining consistent year over year while pre-tax income decreased year over year.
The significant increase in rates is also due to a change in estimated fiscal year pre-tax earnings from the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, resulting in a significant adjustment in this quarter’s rate.
Net income decreased 98.2% and diluted earnings per share decreased 100% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the corresponding prior-year quarter.

Revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2019 decreased 12.0% compared with the first six months of fiscal 2019.
Revenues in our public carrier market, value-added resellers and integrators market and retail market decreased by 9.2%, 3.4% and 26.3%, respectively.
The decline in the commercial segment was primarily due to the project-oriented nature of this business.
Several large customers adjusted their forecasts or pushed out their product requirements from the first six months into the remainder of the fiscal year.
The decline in the retail segment was driven by significantly lower revenues from one of our more significant retail customers following its acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, change in business model and subsequent transition of its business elsewhere, as well as ongoing overall market softness.
Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2020 decreased by 16.9% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2019.

 We used $14.0 million of net cash from operating activities for the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $3.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019.
This fiscal 2020 outflow was driven by a net loss and an increase in inventory.
 Net cash used in investing activities of $3.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020 increased from cash used of $2.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019.
Cash used in both periods was due to capital expenditures largely comprised of investments in information technology.

We utilized our asset based secured Revolving Credit Facility during the first six months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, leading to a cash inflow of $20.9 million and $8.9 million, respectively, during those periods.
We had cash outflows of $3.4 million during the first six months of both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, due to cash dividends paid to shareholders.
 On October 19, 2017, the Company and its primary operating subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as a lender (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated the terms of a previously established secured Revolving Credit Facility and which resulted in, among other modifications, an increase in the Company’s borrowing limit to up to $75 million, from the previous borrowing limit of up to $35 million.
In addition to increasing the borrowing limit, and among other modifications, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement extended the applicable maturity date to October 19, 2021.
As of September 29, 2019, borrowings under the secured Revolving Credit Facility totaled $35.3 million; therefore, we then had $39.7 million available, subject to the Borrowing Base limitations and compliance with the other applicable terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the financial and other covenants discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
