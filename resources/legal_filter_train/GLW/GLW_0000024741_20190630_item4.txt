Based on that evaluation, we have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date.
Corning’s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning’s management, including Corning’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that there was no change in Corning’s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
