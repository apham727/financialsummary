This interim MD&A should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in our 2017 Form 10-K.
The Framework outlines our leadership priorities and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses.
We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.
Under our Framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.
Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.
This strategy allows us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.
 Net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $3.0 billion and $8.3 billion, compared to $2.6 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, for the same periods in 2017, driven by an increase in net sales in all segments.
The increase in both periods was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $200 million and $409 million, respectively, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North America and Europe, an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in data centers and sales from 3M’s Communications Market Division which we acquired in June.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $57 million and $23 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, with volumes exceeding the display glass market’s strong growth and more than offsetting price declines.
Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $54 million and $155 million, respectively, driven by growth in all product categories.
Life Sciences sales increased by $8 million and $54 million, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product lines.

   ·    Lower segment net income in the All Other segment, down $8 million, resulting from continued investment in product development.
 Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.28 per share, or 72%, when compared to the third quarter of 2017, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 76 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
   ·    An increase in the translated earnings contract gains of $174 million.
 Diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.07 per share, or 8%, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, driven by the decrease in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 76 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
In our Display Technologies segment, we expect pricing to continue to improve, with moderate year-over-year declines during the fourth quarter, an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns.
For the full year, we anticipate Corning’s glass volume will grow faster than the expected display glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase in the high-teen percentage range, including approximately $200 million from the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division.
We expect organic growth will improve by a low-teen percentage range driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers.
We expect mid-to-high single digit percentage growth in the Life Sciences segment.

In the third quarter of 2018, Corning amended and restated its revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”).
The Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which Corning must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.
The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.
 There were no significant items that impacted Corning’s financing structure in the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
 During 2017, Corning repurchased 84.4 million shares for approximately $2.4 billion through accelerated share repurchase agreements and open market repurchases under the 2016 Repurchase Program.

 We ended the first three quarters of 2018 with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents.
We utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
There were no incremental taxes beyond the Toll Charge due with the respect to this distribution of cash.
 To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements.
We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $550 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.
Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.
In addition, the company has entered into $300 million of treasury lock agreements to economically fix the benchmark interest rate associated with future debt issuances.
This hedge is designated as a cash flow hedge.
Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
The Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.
 We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.
 Our major source of funding for 2018 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.
We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.

 Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.
The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.
At September 30, 2018, our leverage using this measure was approximately 28%.
As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement.
 Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.
In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.
As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all such provisions.
 There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the contractual obligations disclosed in our 2017 Form 10-K under the caption “Contractual Obligations.”
The estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in our 2017 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first nine months of 2018.
For certain items, additional details are provided below.
 We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.
We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present.
We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.
 Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.
These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life.
This review considers all of the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.
 At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $624 million and $711 million, respectively.
These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.
Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.
The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.
 Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.
Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.
It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Corning had accrued approximately $33 million and $38 million, respectively, (undiscounted) for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.
Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.
The company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements.
