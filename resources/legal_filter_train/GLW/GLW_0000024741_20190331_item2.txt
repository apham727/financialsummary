 ITEM 2.
This interim MD&A should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in our 2018 Form 10-K.
The Framework outlines our leadership priorities and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses.
We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.
Under our Framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.
Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.
This strategy allows us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.
 Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $2.8 billion, compared to $2.5 billion in the same period in 2018.
The increase was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $178 million, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North America, an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in hyper-scale data centers and sales from our acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division (“CMD”).
Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $40 million driven primarily by sales growth of gas particulate filters.
Life Sciences sales increased by $11 million.

   ·    Higher segment net income in all our business segments and All Other segment, up $68 million.
 Diluted earnings per share increased by $1.27 per share when compared to the first quarter of 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 55.5 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
 We believe 2019 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework.
In our Display Technologies segment, we expect full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a mid-single digit percentage.
We anticipate Corning’s display glass volume will grow faster than the expected display glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by television screen size growth and the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China.
We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on the adoption of our innovations.
We expect approximately ten percent or slightly higher sales growth in our Environmental Technologies segment.
We anticipate low to mid-single digit percentage growth in sales for the Life Sciences segment.

   ·    An increase of $11 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales in all product categories.
 Movements in foreign exchange rates increased Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $25 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
 In the three months ended March 31, 2019, gross margin increased by $144 million, or 15% primarily driven by an increase in sales across all operating segments.
   ·    An increase of $25 million in the Optical Communications segment, driven largely by the acquisition of CMD in June 2018.
As a percentage of sales, these expenses decreased by 1% when compared to the same period last year.
 Equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased by $14 million, driven by the absence of a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from a legal settlement.

 (1) The impact to income was primarily driven by yen-denominated hedges of translated earnings.
 The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes in the three months ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
   ·    The release of foreign valuation allowances on deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable from the restructuring of certain Israeli operations.

   (1)    Refer to Note 6 (Earnings (Loss) per Common Share) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
 For the three months ended March 31, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $667 million when compared to the same period in 2018, due to an increase in net income of $1.1 billion.
The increase in net income was offset by the negative impacts of the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $374 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and the Korean won, and $53 million related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI.
Corning utilizes constant currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar currencies.
Effective January 1, 2019, Corning also began using constant currency reporting for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan.

 Net sales of this segment increased by $4 million, or 8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, driven primarily by an increase in sales in our emerging businesses.
 There were no significant items that impacted Corning’s financing structure in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
 In December 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $4 billion share repurchase program with no expiration (the “2016 Repurchase Program”).
On April 26, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $2 billion share repurchase program with no expiration (the “2018 Repurchase Program”).
 In the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 27.1 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $814 million as part of its 2016 Repurchase Program.
 Capital spending totaled $524 million and $655 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We expect our 2019 capital expenditures to be slightly more than $2.0 billion.

 Net cash used by operating activities increased by $349 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in the prior year.
The change was primarily driven by the changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable in the amount of $130 million and $137 million, respectively, and the negative impact of fewer customer deposits received in the amount of $274 million.
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $161 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by lower capital expenditures of $131 million.
 Net cash used in financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2019 decreased by $566 million when compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by a decrease of $543 million in share repurchases.
 We ended the first quarter of 2019 with approximately $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents.
We utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
The Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.
 We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.
 © 2019 Corning Incorporated.
 Our major source of funding for 2019 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.
We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.
 Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.
The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.
At March 31, 2019, our leverage using this measure was approximately 31%.
As of March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with this financial covenant and no amounts were outstanding.
 Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.
In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.
As of March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all such provisions.
 There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the contractual obligations disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K under the caption “Contractual Obligations.”
The estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in our 2018 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first three months of 2019.
For certain items, additional details are provided below.
 We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.
We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present.
We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.
 Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.
These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life.
Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.
This review considers all the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.
 At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $332 million and $719 million, respectively.
These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.
Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.
The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.
 Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements.

 Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.
Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.
It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Corning had accrued approximately $28 million and $30 million, respectively, for the undiscounted estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.
Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.
