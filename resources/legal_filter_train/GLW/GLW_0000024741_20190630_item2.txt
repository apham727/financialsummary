This interim MD&A should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in our 2018 Form 10-K.
The Framework outlined our leadership priorities and articulated the opportunities we saw across our businesses.
We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.
Under the Framework, we targeted generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.
As of June 30, 2019, Corning met its goal of returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and is on track to invest $11 billion for growth and extended leadership.
On June 14, 2019, Corning introduced its 2020-2023 Strategy and Growth Framework.
From 2020 to 2023, the company plans to invest $10 billion to $12 billion for growth and to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders.

Net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $2,940 million and $5,752 million, compared to $2,747 million and $5,247 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2018.
Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased $67 million and $245 million, respectively.
Growth from multi-year hyperscale data center projects drove the increase in enterprise sales in both periods.
Sales in carrier networks were down in the three months and up in the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division (“CMD”), which took place during the second quarter of 2018, also contributed to sales growth.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $68 million and $141 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, with volume increases in the mid-teens in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines.
Life Sciences sales increased by $15 million and $26 million, respectively.
Higher costs of $33 million, primarily accelerated depreciation, within the Display Technologies segment.
Diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.69 per share when compared to the second quarter of 2018, driven by the decrease in net income described, offset by the repurchase of 35.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
The increases in net income outlined above were offset by other net charges and credits of $20 million, primarily driven by accelerated depreciation within the Display Technologies segment and other corporate charges.
Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.53 per share when compared to the first half of 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, offset by the repurchase of 35.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.

We believe 2019 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework and recently introduced Strategy and Growth Framework.
We anticipate Corning’s display glass volume will grow by high-single digits driven by television screen size growth and the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in Hefei, China.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase by a low-to-mid-single digit percentage, including the impact of a full year of sales from the acquisition of CMD.
We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on the adoption of our innovations.
We anticipate a mid-single digit percentage growth in sales for the Life Sciences segment.

For the three months ended June 30, 2019 comprehensive income decreased by $152 million when compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower net income of $646 million offset by $466 million of positive impacts from the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and Korean won.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $515 million when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in net income of $442 million and $92 million of positive impacts from the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses, driven primarily by the euro and the Chinese yuan.
These impacts were partially offset by $53 million related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI.
Corning utilizes constant-currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar currencies.
Effective January 1, 2019, Corning also began using constant-currency reporting for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan.

Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
The Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.
At December 31, 2018 Corning had no outstanding commercial paper.
As of June 30, 2019, Corning had $446 million of outstanding commercial paper.
We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.
We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.
Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.
The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.
As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance and no amounts were outstanding.
Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.
In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.
As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all such provisions.
There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the contractual obligations disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K under the caption “Contractual Obligations.”
The estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in our 2018 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first six months of 2019.
For certain items, additional details are provided below.
We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.
We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present.
We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.
Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.
These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life.
This review considers all the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.
© 2019 Corning Incorporated.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $380 million and $719 million, respectively.
These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.
Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.
The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.
Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements.
Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.
Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.
It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Corning had accrued approximately $26 million and $30 million, respectively, for the undiscounted estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.
Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.
