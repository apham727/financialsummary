This interim MD&A should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in our 2017 Form 10-K.
The Framework outlines our leadership priorities and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses.
We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.
Under our Framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.
Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.
This strategy allows us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.
 Net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2,747 million and $5,247 million, compared to $2,497 million and $4,872 million, respectively, in the same periods in 2017, driven by an increase in net sales in all segments.
The increase in both periods was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $141 million and $209 million, respectively, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North American and Europe, and an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in data centers.
Life Sciences sales increased by $24 million and $46 million, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product lines.
Net sales in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments increased by $3 million and $6 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2018.

   ·    The impact of discrete tax and other tax-related items in the amount of $49 million.
 Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.36 per share, or 86%, when compared to the second quarter of 2017, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 24.6 million shares of common stock for approximately $674 million.
   ·    A decrease of $47 million in equity earnings, driven largely by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of long-term sales agreements with a customer of HSG.
 The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.
 We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that segment net sales will reach approximately $11.3 billion, an increase from prior expectations of $11.0 billion.
In our Display Technologies segment, we expect pricing to continue to improve, with year-over-year declines reaching mid-single digits in the third quarter, an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns.
We anticipate Corning’s LCD glass volume will grow faster than the expected LCD glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase in the high-teen percentage range with organic growth improving by a low-teen percentage range with an additional $200 million from the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers.

 We ended the first half of 2018 with approximately $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents.
We utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
There were no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with the respect to this distribution of cash.
 To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements.
We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $850 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.
Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.
Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
The Company’s $2 billion revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.
 We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.
 Our major source of funding for 2018 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.
We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.

Corning has access to a $2 billion unsecured committed revolving credit facility.
This credit facility includes a leverage ratio financial covenant.
The required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%.
At June 30, 2018, our leverage using this measure was approximately 28%, and, as such, are in compliance with the financial covenant.
 Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.
In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.
As of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all such provisions.
 There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the contractual obligations disclosed in our 2017 Form 10-K under the caption “Contractual Obligations.”
The estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in our 2017 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first six months of 2018.
For certain items, additional details are provided below.
 We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.
We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present.
We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.
 Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.
These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life.
This review considers all of the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.
 At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $663 million and $711 million, respectively.
These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.
Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.
The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.
 Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
