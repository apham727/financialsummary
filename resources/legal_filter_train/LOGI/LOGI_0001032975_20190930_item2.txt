You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.
On September 26, 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire all equity interests of General Workings, Inc. ("Streamlabs") for a total consideration of $89 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment, plus an additional earn-out of up to $29 million in stock based on the achievement of certain net revenues for the period beginning on January 1, 2020 and ending on June 30, 2020 (the "Streamlabs Acquisition"). Streamlabs is a leading provider of software and tools for professional streamers. The Streamlabs Acquisition will supplement our portfolio opportunities. The transaction is subject to various closing conditions and is expected to close in late October 2019. 
Our total sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019 increased 4% and 5%, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, supported by stronger sales in the Americas and EMEA. 
Our sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased 5%, 6%, and 1% in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific, respectively, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Our sales for the six months ended September 30, 2019 increased 5%, 8%, and 1% in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific, respectively, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. 
Our gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased 70 basis points to 37.8% from 37.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Our gross margin for the six months ended September 30, 2019 increased 60 basis points to 37.5% from 36.9% for the six months ended September 30, 2018. Our gross margin for both periods benefited from cost savings, tariff mitigation efforts and product mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange and an increase in U.S.-China tariffs. We expect a negative impact in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 from these tariffs, net of our ongoing mitigation efforts.
Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased to $204.0 million compared to $191.0 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Operating expenses were 28.3% of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to 27.6% of sales in the same period of the prior fiscal year. 
Operating expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2019 increased to $395.5 million compared to $382.5 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Operating expenses were 29.0% of sales for the six months ended September 30, 2019, compared to 29.4% of sales in the same period of the prior fiscal year. 
We believe our future growth will be determined by our ability to rapidly create innovative products across multiple digital platforms, including gaming, digital music devices, video and computing. The following discussion represents key trends specific to our market opportunities.
 On May 19, 2019, the Swiss electorate approved TRAF, a major reform to better align the Swiss tax system with international tax standards. The legislation was subsequently published in the federal register on August 6, 2019 to take effect on January 1, 2020. As of September 30, 2019, TRAF has not been enacted in all cantons, including the canton of Vaud, as the cantonal legislative procedures are in process. We have benefited from a longstanding tax ruling from the canton of Vaud through March 31, 2019. During the second quarter ended September 30, 2019, the canton of Vaud concluded the longstanding cantonal tax ruling will only continue to apply 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of goodwill, intangible assets acquired from business acquisitions, operating right-of-use assets, warranty liabilities, accruals for customer incentives, cooperative marketing, and pricing programs and related breakage when appropriate, accrued sales return liability, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory, share-based compensation expense, uncertain tax positions, and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. 
Other than the recent accounting pronouncement adoptions and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies discussed in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no substantial changes in our significant accounting policies during the six months ended September 30, 2019, compared with the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recent accounting pronouncements adopted and to be adopted.
References to “sales” mean net sales, except as otherwise specified, and the sales growth discussion and sales growth rate percentages are based on U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise specified.
Although our financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a portion of our sales was generated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, such as the Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Taiwan New Dollar, British Pound and Australian Dollar. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, approximately 51% of our sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. 
The increase in sales in our EMEA region for the three-month ended period presented above was primarily driven by growth in Video Collaboration and Pointing Devices, partially offset by a decline in sales in Tablet and Other Accessories and Mobile Speakers. The increase in sales in our EMEA region for the six-month period presented above was primarily driven by growth in Video Collaboration, Mobile Speakers, Pointing Devices and Smart Home.
Sales of Pointing Devices increased 3% and decreased 1% in the three and six months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase in sales for the three-month period was primarily driven by growth in cordless mice, partially offset by a decline in corded mice. The decline in sales for the six-month period was primarily driven by a decrease in corded mice and presentation tools, partially offset by growth in cordless mice. 
Our PC Webcams category comprises PC-based webcams targeted primarily at consumers.
PC Webcams sales increased 2% and decreased 2% in the three and six months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase in sales for the three-month period was primarily driven by an increase in the sales of our Webcam C260, 1080P Pro Stream Webcam, BRIO 4K Stream Edition and C270i IPTV CAM, partially offset by a decline in sales of our HD Pro Webcam C920 and Webcam C170. The decrease in sales for the six-month period was primarily driven by a decline in sales of our HD PRO Webcam C920 and Webcam C170, partially offset by an increase in sales of our Webcam C260, 1080P Pro Stream Webcam, BRIO 4K Stream Edition and C270i IPTV CAM. 
Gaming sales remained flat for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. Increases in the sales of gaming mice, PC gaming keyboard and console gaming controllers were offset by declines in the sales of our gaming headsets and console gaming headsets for both periods presented above.
Sales of Video Collaboration products increased 57% and 41% in the three and six months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase for both periods was primarily driven by the sales of our Rally Ultra-HD PTZ Conference Camera introduced in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, an increase in the sales of our MeetUp video conference camera, and our Tap Touch Controller introduced in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. 
Smart Home sales increased 2% and 6% during the three and six months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase for both periods was primarily due to an increase in the sales of our home security products, partially offset by a decline in sales of our Harmony remote products. 
During the three and six months ended September 30, 2019, marketing and selling expenses increased $12.4 million and $20.8 million, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by higher advertising and marketing expenses and higher personnel-related costs due to increased headcount, partly resulting from the Blue Microphones acquisition. 
Research and development expenses consist of personnel and related overhead costs, contractors and outside consultants, supplies and materials, equipment depreciation and facilities costs, all associated with the design and development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
During the three and six months ended September 30, 2019, research and development expenses increased $2.4 million and $5.7 million, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by higher personnel-related costs due to increased headcount, partly resulting from the Blue Microphones acquisition. 
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead, information technology, and facilities costs for the infrastructure functions such as finance, information systems, executives, human resources, and legal.
During the three and six months ended September 30, 2019, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.2 million and $4.5 million, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower personnel-related costs. 
Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization of acquired intangible assets, including customer relationships and trade names. Acquisition-related costs include legal expense, due diligence costs, and other professional costs incurred for business acquisitions. 
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, amortization of intangible assets and acquisition-related costs remained relatively flat compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. During the six months ended September 30, 2019, amortization of intangible assets and acquisition-related costs increased $1.0 million compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by the intangible assets acquired through the Blue Microphones acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related costs. 
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we implemented a restructuring plan to streamline and realign our overall organizational structure and reallocate resources to support our long-term growth opportunities. In July, 2018, our Board of Directors approved additional costs under this restructuring plan, totaling pre-tax charges of approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million, of which $11.4 million has been recognized cumulatively as of September 30, 2019. The total charges consisted of cash severance and other personnel costs and are presented as restructuring charges (credit), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of June 30, 2019, the Company has substantially completed this restructuring plan. 
Investment income represents earnings, gains, and losses on trading investments related to a deferred compensation plan offered by one of our subsidiaries. 
Currency exchange gain (loss), net relates to balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in our subsidiaries, as well as to the sale of currencies, and to gains or losses recognized on currency exchange forward contracts. We do not speculate in currency positions, but we are alert to opportunities to maximize currency exchange gains and minimize currency exchange losses.
The change in the effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to the transitional income tax impact in Switzerland. We have benefited from a longstanding tax ruling from the canton of Vaud through March 31, 2019. During the second quarter, the canton of Vaud concluded the longstanding cantonal tax ruling will only continue to apply through December 31, 2019. The transitional income tax impact, which represents income tax provision at the current full statutory income tax rate of 13.63% without taking account of the tax reform yet to be enacted, resulted in a tax benefit of $5.9 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2019. In addition, there was a discrete tax benefit of $4.0 million from adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities in Switzerland in the three months ended September 30, 2019. 
The change in the effective income tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the transitional income tax impact in Switzerland discussed above. In the six months ended September 30, 2019, there was a discrete tax benefit of $1.7 million from adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities in Switzerland. Furthermore, there were discrete tax benefits of $6.7 million and $1.8 million from the recognition of excess tax benefits in the United States and reversal of uncertain tax positions from the expiration of statutes of limitations, respectively, in the six-month period ended September 30, 2019, compared with $9.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in the six-month period ended September 30, 2018. 
As of September 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $574.5 million, compared to $604.5 million as of March 31, 2019. As of September 30, 2019, 48% of the cash and cash equivalents were held in Switzerland and 12% held in Hong Kong and China. We do not expect to incur any material adverse tax impact except for what has been recognized, or be significantly inhibited by any country in which we do business from the repatriation of funds to Switzerland, our home domicile.
 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the six months ended September 30, 2019, was primarily due to payment of cash dividends, purchases of property, plant and equipment, tax withholdings related to settlements of restricted stock units and shares repurchased under our share buyback program, partially offset by proceeds from exercises of stock options and purchase rights and net cash provided by operating activities.
As of September 30, 2019, our working capital was $622.4 million, compared to $632.6 million as of March 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower cash and cash equivalents and higher accounts payable, partially offset by higher accounts receivable, net, higher inventories, higher other current assets and lower accrued and other current liabilities. Our working capital increased by $183.8 million compared to $438.6 million as of September 30, 2018, which was primarily driven by higher cash and cash equivalents, higher accounts receivable, net, lower accounts payable, and lower accrued and other current liabilities, partially offset by lower inventories.
We had several uncommitted, unsecured bank lines of credit aggregating $77.5 million as of September 30, 2019. There are no financial covenants under these lines of credit with which we must comply. As of September 30, 2019, we had outstanding bank guarantees of $20.6 million under these lines of credit. 
DSO for the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by 2 days to 58 days, compared to 60 days for the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to timing of customer payments and claims.
ITO for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased to 5.3 compared to 4.9 in the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to higher sales growth (hence higher cost of goods sold) than inventory increase. 
During the six months ended September 30, 2019, we generated $143.0 million of cash from operating activities. Our main sources of operating cash flows were from net income, after adding back non-cash expenses of depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation expense, and from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable, net was primarily driven by growth and timing of customer payments and claims. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by the expectation of increased sales for the holidays in the third quarter. The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by the timing of purchases and related payments. 
Net cash used in investing activities was $18.6 million, primarily due to $18.1 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities was $150.9 million, primarily due to $124.2 million payment of cash dividend, $15.1 million used for repurchases of our registered shares, and $20.9 million tax withholdings related to net share settlements of restricted stock units, partially offset by $9.3 million in proceeds received from exercises of stock options and purchase rights.
During the six months ended September 30, 2019, there was a $3.6 million loss from effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, compared to a loss of $9.2 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. The loss from effect of currency exchange rate changes during the six months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Chinese Renminbi and Brazilian Real against the U.S.Dollar by 3%, 5%, 7% respectively. The loss from effect of currency exchange rate changes during the six months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Brazilian Real, and Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar by 6%, 9%, 18% and 6%, respectively, during the period. 
On September 26, 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire all equity interests of Streamlabs for a total consideration of $89 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment, plus an additional earn-out of up to $29 million in stock based on the achievement of certain net revenues for the period beginning on January 1, 2020 and ending on June 30, 2020. The transaction is subject to various closing conditions and is expected to close in late October 2019.
In fiscal year 2020, we paid a cash dividend of CHF 121.8 million (U.S. Dollar amount of $124.2 million) out of retained earnings available at the end of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2019, we paid a cash dividend of CHF 110.7 million (U.S. Dollar amount of $114.0 million) out of retained earnings available at the end of fiscal year 2018. Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our shareholders.
We lease facilities under operating leases, certain of which require us to pay property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Operating leases for facilities are generally renewable at our option and usually include escalation clauses linked to inflation. The remaining terms of our non-cancelable operating leases expire in various years through 2031. 
As of September 30, 2019, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to original design manufacturers, contract manufacturers and other suppliers, the majority of which are expected to be fulfilled within the next 12 months. Non-cancelable purchase commitments for capital expenditures primarily relate to commitments for tooling for new and existing products, computer hardware, leasehold and improvements. We expect to continue making capital expenditures in the future to support product development activities and ongoing and expanded operations. Although open purchase commitments are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us to reschedule or adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to delivery of goods or performance of services. 
For further detail about our contractual obligations and commitments, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
 We did not repurchase any of our registered shares during the three months ended September 30, 2019. As of September 30, 2019, $172.4 million is still available for repurchase under the 2017 share buyback program.
