Percentage of constant dollar sales growth is calculated by translating prior period sales in each local currency at the current period’s average exchange rate for that currency and comparing that to current period sales.
Dollars, our financial results could be affected by shifts in currency exchange rates.
References to “sales” mean net sales, except as otherwise specified, and the sales growth discussion and sales growth rate percentages are based on U.S.
Although our financial results are reported in U.S.
Dollars, a portion of our sales was generated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, such as the Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Taiwan New Dollar, British Pound and Australian Dollar.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, approximately 51% of our sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.

During the three months ended September 30, 2019, amortization of intangible assets and acquisition-related costs remained relatively flat compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.
During the six months ended September 30, 2019, amortization of intangible assets and acquisition-related costs increased $1.0 million compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by the intangible assets acquired through the Blue Microphones acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related costs.
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we implemented a restructuring plan to streamline and realign our overall organizational structure and reallocate resources to support our long-term growth opportunities.

Currency exchange gain (loss), net relates to balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in our subsidiaries, as well as to the sale of currencies, and to gains or losses recognized on currency exchange forward contracts.

The change in the effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to the transitional income tax impact in Switzerland.

The change in the effective income tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the transitional income tax impact in Switzerland discussed above.
In the six months ended September 30, 2019, there was a discrete tax benefit of $1.7 million from adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities in Switzerland.
Furthermore, there were discrete tax benefits of $6.7 million and $1.8 million from the recognition of excess tax benefits in the United States and reversal of uncertain tax positions from the expiration of statutes of limitations, respectively, in the six-month period ended September 30, 2019, compared with $9.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in the six-month period ended September 30, 2018.

As of September 30, 2019, 48% of the cash and cash equivalents were held in Switzerland and 12% held in Hong Kong and China.
 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the six months ended September 30, 2019, was primarily due to payment of cash dividends, purchases of property, plant and equipment, tax withholdings related to settlements of restricted stock units and shares repurchased under our share buyback program, partially offset by proceeds from exercises of stock options and purchase rights and net cash provided by operating activities.
As of September 30, 2019, our working capital was $622.4 million, compared to $632.6 million as of March 31, 2019.
The decrease was primarily driven by lower cash and cash equivalents and higher accounts payable, partially offset by higher accounts receivable, net, higher inventories, higher other current assets and lower accrued and other current liabilities.
Our working capital increased by $183.8 million compared to $438.6 million as of September 30, 2018, which was primarily driven by higher cash and cash equivalents, higher accounts receivable, net, lower accounts payable, and lower accrued and other current liabilities, partially offset by lower inventories.

DSO for the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by 2 days to 58 days, compared to 60 days for the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to timing of customer payments and claims.
ITO for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased to 5.3 compared to 4.9 in the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to higher sales growth (hence higher cost of goods sold) than inventory increase.
During the six months ended September 30, 2019, we generated $143.0 million of cash from operating activities.
The increase in accounts receivable, net was primarily driven by growth and timing of customer payments and claims.
The increase in inventories was primarily driven by the expectation of increased sales for the holidays in the third quarter.
The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by the timing of purchases and related payments.
Net cash used in investing activities was $18.6 million, primarily due to $18.1 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities was $150.9 million, primarily due to $124.2 million payment of cash dividend, $15.1 million used for repurchases of our registered shares, and $20.9 million tax withholdings related to net share settlements of restricted stock units, partially offset by $9.3 million in proceeds received from exercises of stock options and purchase rights.
During the six months ended September 30, 2019, there was a $3.6 million loss from effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, compared to a loss of $9.2 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year.
The loss from effect of currency exchange rate changes during the six months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Chinese Renminbi and Brazilian Real against the U.S.Dollar by 3%, 5%, 7% respectively.
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow generated from operations and, to a much lesser extent, capital markets and borrowings.
On September 26, 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire all equity interests of Streamlabs for a total consideration of $89 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment, plus an additional earn-out of up to $29 million in stock based on the achievement of certain net revenues for the period beginning on January 1, 2020 and ending on June 30, 2020.
The transaction is subject to various closing conditions and is expected to close in late October 2019.

In fiscal year 2019, we paid a cash dividend of CHF 110.7 million (U.S. Dollar amount of $114.0 million) out of retained earnings available at the end of fiscal year 2018.
Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our shareholders.
In March 2017, our Board of Directors approved our 2017 share buyback program, which authorizes us to purchase up to $250.0 million of our outstanding shares over a three-year period.
Although we enter into trading plans for systematic repurchases (e.g., 10b5-1 trading plans) from time to time, our share buyback program provides us with the opportunity to make repurchases during periods of favorable market conditions and is expected to remain in effect for a period of three years.
Shares may be repurchased from time to time on the open market, through block trades or otherwise.
As of September 30, 2019, $172.4 million is still available for repurchase under the 2017 share buyback program.
We lease facilities under operating leases, certain of which require us to pay property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.
Operating leases for facilities are generally renewable at our option and usually include escalation clauses linked to inflation.
The remaining terms of our non-cancelable operating leases expire in various years through 2031.
As of September 30, 2019, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to original design manufacturers, contract manufacturers and other suppliers, the majority of which are expected to be fulfilled within the next 12 months.
Non-cancelable purchase commitments for capital expenditures primarily relate to commitments for tooling for new and existing products, computer hardware, leasehold and improvements.
Although open purchase commitments are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us to reschedule or adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to delivery of goods or performance of services.
For further detail about our contractual obligations and commitments, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
The scope of these indemnities varies, but in some instances includes indemnification for damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
As of September 30, 2019, no amounts have been accrued for indemnification provisions.
We also indemnify our current and former directors and certain current and former officers.
Certain costs incurred for providing such indemnification may be recoverable under various insurance policies.
We believe that these matters lack merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them.
 We did not repurchase any of our registered shares during the three months ended September 30, 2019.
As of September 30, 2019, $172.4 million is still available for repurchase under the 2017 share buyback program.
