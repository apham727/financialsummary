Fiscal 2019 first half net sales of $174,498,000 decreased $5.3 million or 3% as compared to first half fiscal 2018 net sales of $179,771,000.
Fiscal 2019 second quarter operating loss of $(20.3) million represents a $24.8 million change from operating income of $4.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $24.8 million change from operating income in fiscal 2018 to an operating loss in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Adjusted fiscal 2019 second quarter operating income of $1.5 million decreased $3.1 million or 66% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $4.6 million.
Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Fiscal 2019 first half operating loss of $(17.3) million represents a $2.9 million improvement from an operating loss of $(20.3) million in the first half of fiscal 2018.
Both fiscal years recorded goodwill impairment charges in the Lighting Segment.
There was a $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2019 and a $28 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018.
Adjusted first half fiscal 2019 operating income of $5.1 million decreased $2.8 million or 35% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $7.8 million.
Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million.
The Company believes it is appropriate to evaluate its performance after making adjustments to the as-reported U.S. GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share.
Adjusted operating income, net income and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of goodwill impairment, severance costs, transition and re-alignment costs, and restructuring and plant closure costs, are non-GAAP financial measures.
We believe that these adjusted supplemental measures are useful in assessing the operating performance of our business.
Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the periods indicated.

The change in the net loss in fiscal 2018 to the net loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by the $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 with no comparable charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter change is a $4.7 million charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets with no comparable charge in fiscal 2019.
When the impact of all non-GAAP charges is removed from both fiscal years, the fiscal 2019 adjusted net income of $875,000 decreased $2.4 million from fiscal 2018 adjusted net income of $3,267,000.

The $4,437,000 income tax benefit in the first half of fiscal 2019 represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 24.0%, which is slightly higher than the expected annual rate of 23% due to the goodwill impairment.
The first half FY 2018 effective tax rate of 18.9% and income tax benefit of $3,990,000 was most notably influenced by the first quarter goodwill impairment partially offset by a $4.7 million re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets for the US tax rate change on the enactment date of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.
The Company reported a net loss of $(14,033,000) in the first half of fiscal 2019 compared to net loss of $(17,097,000) in the same period of the prior year.
The change from the net loss in fiscal 2018 to the net loss in the second half of fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by the $20.2 million and the $28 million goodwill impairment charges in the first of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
Also contributing to the year-over-year change is a $4.7 million charge in the first half of fiscal 2018 related to the re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets with no comparable charge in fiscal 2019.
When the impact of all non-GAAP charges is removed from both fiscal years, the fiscal 2019 adjusted net income of $3,078,000 decreased $1.9 million from fiscal 2018 adjusted net income of $5,001,000.

The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity.
For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures.
At December 31, 2018, the Company had working capital of $74.8 million, compared to $67.9 million at June 30, 2018.
The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.49 to 1 as compared to a ratio of 2.61 to 1 at June 30, 2018.
The $6.9 million increase in working capital from June 30, 2018 to December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the net effect of increased cash and cash equivalents ($6.4 million), increased net accounts receivable ($5.8 million), increased net inventory ($3.1 million), an increase in accrued expenses ($0.7 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes ($0.8 million), and an increase in accounts payable ($8.8 million).
Of the $5.8 million increase in accounts receivable, $5.3 million is attributed to the adoption of the new revenue guidance.
The Company generated $7.6 million of cash from operating activities in the first half of fiscal 2019 as compared to a use of cash of $43,000 in the same period of the prior year.
This $7.7 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily the net result of an increase rather than a decrease in accounts payable (favorable change of $11.3 million), a smaller increase in net accounts receivable (favorable change of $9.8 million), an increase rather than a decrease in net inventory (unfavorable change of $9.6 million), a greater decrease in accrued expenses and other (unfavorable change of $1.2 million), and an improvement in net loss from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 more than offset by several non-cash add-backs to the net loss in both fiscal years (unfavorable change of $3.3 million).
Net accounts receivable were $56.4 million and $50.6 million at December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.
DSO was 53 days at December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018.

Net inventories of $54.1 million at December 31, 2018 increased $3.1 million from $51.0 million at June 30, 2018.
The increase of $3.1 million is the result of an increase in gross inventory of $3.8 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.7 million.
Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increased 4.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2019 in the Graphics Segment which was partially offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $1.7 million.
The Company has a secured $100 million revolving line of credit with its bank, with $48.4 million of the credit line available as of January 28, 2019.
Capital expenditures for the first half of fiscal 2019 increased $0.4 million to $1.6 million from the same period in fiscal 2018.

In January 2019, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable February 12, 2019 to shareholders of record as of February 4, 2019.
The indicated annual cash dividend rate for fiscal 2019 is $0.20 per share.
The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which indicates that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant.
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
