The increase in adjusted operating income was the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit and increased gross profit as a percentage of sales, and an increase in selling and administrative expenses.
Fiscal 2018 first half operating loss of $(20,267,000) represents a $24.2 million change from operating income of $3,884,000 in the first half of fiscal 2017.
The change from operating income in fiscal 2017 to an operating loss in fiscal 2018 is primarily the result of a $28 million goodwill impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The Company believes it is appropriate to evaluate its performance after making adjustments to the as-reported U.S. GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share.
We believe that these adjusted supplemental measures are useful in assessing the operating performance of our business.
Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the periods indicated.
The reconciliation of reported net income and earnings per share to adjusted net income and earnings per share may not agree due to rounding differences and due to the difference between basic and dilutive weighted average shares outstanding in the computation of earnings per share.

Light fixtures having solid-state LED technology represent 91.7% of total lighting product net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 78.2% of total lighting product net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Total lighting product net sales excludes sales related to installation and shipping and handling.
There was a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 as customers continue to convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.
Lighting Segment total net sales of solid-state LED technology in light fixtures have been recorded as indicated in the table below.

Administrative expenses of $2,985,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.9 million or 41.0% from the same period of the prior year.
Most of the increase in employee compensation and benefit expense is the result of the reduction of incentive-based compensation in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 which was driven by the operating results of the Company.
The Company reported $417,000 net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to net interest income of $20,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
The change from interest income in fiscal 2017 to interest expense in fiscal 2018 is the result of borrowing against the Company’s line of credit.
The Company reported a net loss of $(1,468,000) in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to net income of $2,006,000 in the same period of the prior year.
The change between net income in fiscal 2017 to a net loss in fiscal 2018 is mostly driven by the $4.7 million charge in fiscal 2018 related to the re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets.
Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter net change in net income are increased net sales, increased gross profit and an improvement of gross profit as a percentage of sales, increased selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring and plant closure costs in fiscal 2017 with no comparable costs in fiscal 2018.
Diluted loss per share of $(0.06) was reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $0.08 diluted earnings per share in the same period of fiscal 2017.

The Graphics Segment first half fiscal 2018 operating income of $3,731,000 increased $1.5 million or 70.3% from operating income of $2,191,000 in the same period of fiscal 2017.
The gross profit (loss) relates to the change in the intercompany profit in inventory elimination.
The $0.7 million increase is the result of increased employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.5 million increase) and by a net increase in other cost categories.
Most of the increase in employee compensation and benefit expense is the result of the reduction of incentive-based compensation in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 which is driven by the operating results of the Company.
The Company reported $820,000 net interest expense in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to net interest income of $34,000 in the first half of fiscal 2017.
The change from interest income in fiscal 2017 to interest expense in fiscal 2018 is the result of borrowing against the Company’s line of credit.
The $3,990,000 tax benefit in the first half of fiscal 2018 represents a consolidated overall tax rate of 135.6%.
This is a result of an effective tax rate of 58.2% influenced most notably by the first quarter goodwill impairment, and by a $4.7 million tax adjustment related to the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets partially offset by a favorable tax impact related to the re-alignment of the Company’s tax expense to a lower effective tax rate, both related to the recently enacted TCJA legislation.
The change between net income in fiscal 2017 to a net loss in fiscal 2018 is mostly driven by the $4.7 million charge in fiscal 2018 related to the re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and by the first quarter goodwill impairment.
Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter net change in net income are increased net sales, increased gross profit and an improvement of gross profit as a percentage of sales, increased selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring and plant closure costs in fiscal 2017 with no comparable costs in fiscal 2018.

The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the first half of fiscal 2018 were 25,824,000 shares as compared to 25,859,000 shares in the same period last year.
The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity.
For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures.
The Company used $0.8 million of cash from operating activities in the first half of fiscal 2018 as compared to a source of cash of $4.6 million in the same period of the prior year.
This $5.4 million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily the net result of a larger increase in accounts receivable (unfavorable change of $8.2 million), a larger decrease in accounts payable (unfavorable change of $2.4 million), a decrease rather than an increase in customer prepayments (unfavorable change of $0.4 million), a smaller decrease in net inventory (unfavorable change of $0.7 million), a smaller decrease in accrued expenses and other (favorable change of $1.9 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes (favorable change of $0.8 million), and a change from net income in fiscal 2017 to a net loss in fiscal 2018 more than offset by an increase in non-cash items (favorable change of $3.7 million).
Net accounts receivable were $59.7 million and $48.9 million at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively.
DSO increased to 56 days at December 31, 2017 from 52 days at June 30, 2017.
The Company believes that its receivables are ultimately collectible or recoverable, net of certain reserves, and that aggregate allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate.
Net inventories of $48.7 million at December 31, 2017 decreased $1.4 million from $50.0 million at June 30, 2017.
The decrease of $1.4 million is the result of a decrease in gross inventory of $1.0 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.4 million.
Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increases occurred in the first half of fiscal 2018 in the Graphics Segment of approximately $0.9 million which was more than offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $2.2 million.
The Company believes that its $100 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2018 operational and capital expenditure needs.
Capital expenditures for the first half of fiscal 2018 decreased $1.6 million to $1.2 million from the same period in fiscal 2017.
The Company sold its Woonsocket manufacturing facility for $1.5 million which contributed to the change in cash flow from investing activities from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018.
The $3.3 million favorable change in cash flow was the net result of borrowings in excess of payments of long term debt of $2.5 million, and a decrease in the purchase of treasury shares coupled with an increase in the distribution of treasury shares (favorable change of $0.7 million).
The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk and has no off-balance sheet arrangements, except for various operating leases.
In January 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable February 13, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 5, 2018.
The indicated annual cash dividend rate for fiscal 2018 is $0.20 per share.
The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which indicates that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant.
The Company continually reviews these estimates and their underlying assumptions to ensure they remain appropriate.
The Company believes the items discussed below are among its most significant accounting policies because they utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management’s judgment.
Revenue is recognized when title to goods and risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of a purchase arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured.
Sales are recorded net of estimated returns, rebates and discounts.
In certain arrangements with customers, as is the case with the sale of some of our solid-state LED video screens, revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the video screen at the job site.
Product revenue related to orders where the customer requires the Company to install the product is recognized when the product is installed.
The company provides product warranties and certain post-shipment service, support and maintenance of certain solid-state LED video screens and billboards.
Installation revenue is recognized when the products have been fully installed.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities, other than normal warranties.
Revenue from the management of media content and digital hardware related to active digital signage is recognized evenly over the service period with the customer.
Shipping and handling revenue coincides with the recognition of revenue from the sale of the product.
In situations where the Company is responsible for re-imaging programs with multiple sites, each site is viewed as a separate unit of accounting and has stand-alone value to the customer.
Revenue is recognized upon the Company’s complete performance at the location, which may include a site survey, graphics products, lighting products, and installation of products.
The selling price assigned to each site is based upon an agreed upon price between the Company and its customer and reflects the estimated selling price for that site relative to the selling price for sites with similar image requirements.
The Company also evaluates the appropriateness of revenue recognition in accordance with the accounting standard on software revenue recognition.
Our solid-state LED video screens, billboards and active digital signage contain software elements which the Company has determined are incidental.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are reported on the Company’s balance sheet.
The Company has adopted ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.” As a result of early adoption of this accounting guidance, prior periods have been re-classified, which only affected the financial statement presentation and not the measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets.
These audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve.
In management’s opinion, adequate provision has been made for potential adjustments arising from these audits.
The reserve for uncertain tax positions is not expected to change significantly in the next twelve months.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company re-valued the deferred tax balances because of the change in US tax rate resulting in a one-time deferred tax expense of $4,676,578.
Carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and intangible assets.
The Company may first assess qualitative factors in order to determine if goodwill is impaired.
If through the qualitative assessment it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired, no further testing is required.
If it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, or if the Company elects not to first assess qualitative factors, the Company’s impairment testing continues at the reporting unit level with the estimation of the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets using a combination of a market approach and an income (discounted cash flow) approach.
Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests.
  Carrying values for long-lived tangible assets and definite-lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant.
Impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of Company management when it believes that a change in circumstances in the business or external factors warrants a review.
The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for probable estimated losses resulting from either customer disputes or the inability of its customers to make required payments.
The Company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by first considering all known collectability problems of customers’ accounts, and then applying certain percentages against the various aging categories based on the due date of the remaining receivables.
The resulting allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is an estimate based upon the Company’s knowledge of its business and customer base, and historical trends.
The amount ultimately not collected may differ from the reserve established, particularly in the case where percentages are applied against aging categories.
In all cases, it is management’s goal to carry a reserve against the Company’s accounts receivable which is adequate based upon the information available at that time so that net accounts receivable is properly stated.
These allowances are based upon contractual terms and historical trends.
The Company offers a limited warranty that its products are free from defects in workmanship and materials.
The specific terms and conditions vary somewhat by product line, but generally cover defective products returned within one to five years, with some exceptions where the terms extend to ten years, from the date of shipment.
The Company calculates its liability for warranty claims by applying estimates based upon historical claims as a percentage of sales to cover unknown claims, as well as estimating the total amount to be incurred for known warranty issues.
The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
The Company maintains an inventory reserve for probable obsolete and excess inventory.
The Company first determines its obsolete inventory reserve by considering specific known obsolete items, and then by applying certain percentages to specific inventory categories based upon inventory turns.
The Company uses various tools, in addition to inventory turns, to identify which inventory items have the potential to become obsolete.
A combination of financial modeling and qualitative input factors are used to establish excess and obsolete inventory reserves and management adjusts these reserves as more information becomes available about the ultimate disposition of the inventory item.
Management values inventory at lower of cost or market.
The Company continually reviews these estimates and their underlying assumptions to ensure they remain appropriate.
The Company believes the items discussed below are among its most significant accounting policies because they utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management’s judgment.
In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.” The amended guidance requires an entity to measure in scope inventory at lower of cost and net realizable value.
The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, or the Company’s fiscal 2018.
We adopted the new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and there was no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company has not yet determined the impact the amended guidance will have on its financial statements.
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-08, “Principal versus Agent Considerations.” The amendment is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, or the Company’s fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
The Company has determined the amended guidance will have an immaterial impact on its financial statements.
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” This amended guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, or the Company’s fiscal 2018.
Additionally, excess tax benefits are now included in net cash flows provided by operating activities rather than net cash flows provided by financing activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The treatment of forfeitures has not changed, as the Company is electing to continue the current process of estimating forfeiture at the time of grant.
The Company had no unrecognized excess tax benefits from prior periods to record upon the adoption of this ASU.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019, or the Company’s fiscal 2021.
  (1)   In the first half of fiscal 2018, all 575,000 shares authorized for the Company’s Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan have been extinguished by purchase in the open market.
Newly issued shares from the Company’s 2012 Stock Incentive Plan will replace shares purchased in the open market to fulfill the obligation the plan has to its participants.
