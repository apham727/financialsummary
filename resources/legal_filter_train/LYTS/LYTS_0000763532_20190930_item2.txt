Fiscal 2020 first quarter operating income of $6.9 million increased $4.0 million from operating income of $2.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The $4.0 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2019 was impacted by the sale of the Company’s New Windsor, New York facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which favorably resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4.8 million. Also contributing to the period-over-period change in operating income is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million with no comparable event in fiscal 2020. When the impact of the sale of the New Windsor facility along with the other restructuring and plant closure costs are removed from the operating results along with the one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019, operating income period-over-period remained relatively flat. Refer to the discussions in the “results of operations” for each of the Company’s reportable segments for further explanation of the period-over-period change in sales and operating income. 
Selling and administrative expenses of $8,060,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 decreased $3.6 million from the same period of fiscal 2019 selling and administrative expenses of $11,625,000, primarily due to the $4.8 million gain on the sale of the New Windsor, New York facility. When the $4.8 million gain is removed from fiscal 2020 results, there was a $1.3 million or 11.1% increase in selling and administrative expenses. The increase in selling and administrative expenses is mostly driven by higher commission expense which is the result of increased sales volume and a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 with no comparable event in fiscal 2020. 
The Lighting Segment first quarter fiscal 2019 operating income of $9,159,000 increased $5.3 million from operating income of $3,850,000 in the same period of fiscal 2019 primarily due to the $4.8million gain on the sale of its New Windsor, New York facility. When the impact of $4.8 million gain is removed from fiscal 2020 results along with the restructuring and plant closure costs in both fiscal years, fiscal 2020 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $4,510,000 was $70,000 higher than fiscal 2019 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $4,440,000. The increase in sales volume and gross profit was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses.  
Graphics Segment net sales of $25,510,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $2.0 million or 8.4% from fiscal 2019 same period net sales of $23,525,000. Growth was realized across three product market applications; petroleum, other retail printed graphics, and digital signage. 
The gross profit or loss relates to the elimination of intercompany profit in inventory. 
The Company reported $431,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $518,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The change from interest expense from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 is primarily the result of reduced borrowings against the Company’s line of credit. The Company also incurred $82,000 expense related to net foreign currency transaction losses from transactions with its customer and suppliers through its Mexican subsidiary. 
The Company reported a net income of $4,475,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to net income of $1,749,000 in the same period of the prior year. The change in net income between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 includes the $4.8 million gain on the sale of the Company’s New Windsor, New York facility along with other restructuring and plant closure costs. The change in net income is also the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit, increased selling and administrative expenses, decreased interest expense, and a higher tax rate. Diluted earnings per share of $0.17 was reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $0.07 diluted earnings per share in the same period of fiscal 2018. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were 26,293,000 shares as compared to 26,365,000 shares in the same period last year. 
The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity. For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures. 
The Company generated $6.4 million of cash from operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to a source of cash of $2.2 million in the same period of the prior year. This $4.2 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities is the result the Company’s strategy to aggressively manage its working capital which includes the reduction of the accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO), increasing inventory turns while simultaneously reducing inventory levels, and effectively managing the Company’s supply chain which includes partnering with its suppliers to find the appropriate service level while effectively managing payment terms. 
Net accounts receivable was $58.4 million and $54.7 million at September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. DSO decreased to 57 days at September 30, 2019 from 63 days at June 30, 2019. The Company believes that its receivables are ultimately collectible or recoverable, net of certain reserves, and that aggregate allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate. 
Net inventories of $43.1 million at September 30, 2019 decreased $0.4 million from $43.5 million at June 30, 2019. The decrease of $0.4 million is the result of a decrease in gross inventory of $0.3 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.1 million. Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory decreased 0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in the Graphics Segment which more than offset an increase in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $0.4 million. 
Cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the Company’s line of credit is the Company’s primary source of liquidity. The Company has a secured $75 million revolving line of credit with its bank, with $53.0 million of the credit line available as of October 21, 2019. This line of credit is a $75 million five-year credit line expiring in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company believes that its $75 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2020 operational and capital expenditure needs. The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants. 
The Company had a source of cash of $12.0 million related to investing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to a use of cash of $0.6 million in the same period of the prior year, resulting in a favorable change of $12.6 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $0.3 million to $0.4 million from the same period in fiscal 2019. The Company sold its New Windsor, New York manufacturing facility for $12.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which contributed to the change in cash flow from investing activities from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. 
The Company used $17.7 million of cash related to financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to a use of cash of $0.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The $17.2 million unfavorable change in cash flow was the net result of payments in excess of borrowings of long-term debt of $17.2 million. 
In November 2019, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable November 26, 2019 to shareholders of record as of November 18, 2019. The indicated annual cash dividend rate for fiscal 2020 is $0.20 per share. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which indicates that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant.
