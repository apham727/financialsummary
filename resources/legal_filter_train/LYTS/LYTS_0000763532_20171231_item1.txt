 The accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these financial statements.
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements include all normal adjustments and disclosures necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of  December 31, 2017, the results of its operations for the three and six month periods ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, and its cash flows for the six month periods ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LSI Industries Inc. (an Ohio corporation) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), all of which are wholly owned.
All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Sales are recorded net of estimated returns, rebates and discounts.
In certain arrangements with customers, as is the case with the sale of some of our solid-state LED (light emitting diode) video screens, revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the video screen at the job site.
Product revenue related to orders where the customer requires the Company to install the product is recognized when the product is installed.
The Company provides product warranties and certain post-shipment service, support and maintenance of certain solid state LED video screens.
Installation revenue is recognized when the products have been fully installed.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities, other than normal warranties.
Service revenue from integrated design, project and construction management, and site permitting is recognized when all products at a customer site have been installed.
Revenue from the management of media content and digital hardware related to active digital signage is recognized evenly over the service period with the customer.
Shipping and handling revenue coincides with the recognition of revenue from sale of the product.
In situations where the Company is responsible for re-imaging programs with multiple sites, each site is viewed as a separate unit of accounting and has stand-alone value to the customer.
Revenue is recognized upon the Company’s complete performance at the location, which  may include a site survey, graphics products, lighting products, and installation of products.
The selling price assigned to each site is based upon an agreed upon price between the Company and its customer and reflects the estimated selling price for that site relative to the selling price for sites with similar image requirements.
The Company also evaluates the appropriateness of revenue recognition in accordance with the accounting standards on software revenue recognition.
Our solid-state LED video screens and active digital signage contain software elements which the Company has determined are incidental.
The Company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by first considering all known collectability problems of customers’ accounts, and then applying certain percentages against the various aging categories based on the due date of the remaining receivables.
Receivables deemed uncollectable are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted.
These allowances are based upon historical trends.
The following table presents the Company’s net accounts receivable at the dates indicated.
The Company maintains balances at financial institutions in the United States.
In the United States, the FDIC limit for insurance coverage on non-interest bearing accounts is $250,000.
As of  December 31, 2017 and  June 30, 2017, the Company had bank balances of $4,827,512 and $4,488,000, respectively, without insurance coverage.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out basis.
The Company maintains an inventory reserve for obsolete and excess inventory.
The Company first determines its obsolete inventory reserve by considering specific known obsolete items, and then by applying certain percentages to specific inventory categories based upon inventory turns.
The Company uses various tools, in addition to inventory turns, to identify which inventory items have the potential to become obsolete.
A combination of financial modeling and qualitative input factors are used to establish excess and obsolete inventory reserves and management adjusts these reserves as more information becomes available about the ultimate disposition of the inventory item.
The Company recorded $1,862,000 and $1,669,000 of depreciation expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $3,744,000 and $3,397,000 of depreciation expense in the first half of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized to expense over periods ranging between seven and twenty years.
The Company evaluates definite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment when triggering events are identified.
Neither indefinite-lived intangible assets nor the excess of cost over fair value of assets acquired ("goodwill") are amortized, however they are subject to review for impairment.
See additional information about goodwill and intangibles in Note 7.
Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment analyses, long-lived asset impairment analyses, and in the purchase price of acquired companies (if any).
The accounting guidance on fair value measurement was used to measure the fair value of these nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities.
The Company offers a limited warranty that its products are free from defects in workmanship and materials.
The specific terms and conditions vary somewhat by product line, but generally cover defective products returned within one to five years, with some exceptions where the terms extend to ten years, from the date of shipment.
The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
The Company expenses as research and development all costs associated with development of software used in solid-state LED products.
Research and development costs related to both product and software development totaled $1,379,000 and $1,269,00 for the three months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $2,941,000 and $2,670,000 for the six months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The computation of basic earnings per common share is based on the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period net of treasury shares held in the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
Common share equivalents include the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, contingently issuable shares and common shares to be issued under a deferred compensation plan, all of which totaled 756,000 and 787,000 shares for the three month ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 686,000 shares and 852,000 shares for the six months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
See further discussion of earnings per share in Note 4.
In  February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.
In  March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” This amended guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2016, or the Company’s fiscal 2018.
Additionally, excess tax benefits are now included in net cash flows provided by operating activities rather than net cash flows provided by financing activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The treatment of forfeitures has not changed, as the Company is electing to continue the current process of estimating forfeiture at the time of grant.
The Company had no unrecognized excess tax benefits from prior periods to record upon the adoption of this ASU.
In  January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which simplifies the testing for goodwill impairment by eliminating a previously required step.
The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after  December 15, 2019, or the Company’s fiscal 2021.
The Company does not have any comprehensive income items other than net income.
No items were identified during this evaluation that required adjustment to or disclosure in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company merged its Technology Segment with the Lighting Segment to be in alignment with the financial information received by the Chief Executive Officer and how the business is managed.
Corporate and Eliminations, which captures the Company’s corporate administrative activities, is also reported in the segment information.
The Company’s corporate administration activities are reported in the Corporate and Eliminations line item.
These activities primarily include intercompany profit in inventory eliminations, expense related to certain corporate officers and support staff, the Company’s internal audit staff, expense related to the Company’s Board of Directors, stock option expense for options granted to corporate administration employees, certain consulting expenses, investor relations activities, and a portion of the Company’s legal, auditing and professional fee expenses.
There was no concentration of consolidated net sales in the three and six months ended  December 31, 2017 or 2016.
There was no concentration of accounts receivable at  December 31, 2017 or  June 30, 2017.
The segment net sales reported above represent sales to external customers.
Segment operating income, which is used in management’s evaluation of segment performance, represents net sales less all operating expenses.
Identifiable assets are those assets used by each segment in its operations.
The Company’s operations are located solely within the United States.
    (a)   Includes shares accounted for like treasury stock.
    (b)   Calculated using the “Treasury Stock” method as if dilutive securities were exercised and the funds were used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period.
Carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment.
The Company  may first assess qualitative factors in order to determine if goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired.
If through the qualitative assessment it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not impaired, no further testing is required.
If it is determined more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are impaired, or if the Company elects not to first assess qualitative factors, the Company’s impairment testing continues with the estimation of the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets using a combination of a market approach and an income (discounted cash flow) approach, at the reporting unit level.
Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether assets  may have become impaired between annual impairment tests.
The Company has a total of three reporting units that contain goodwill.
There are two reporting units within the Lighting Segment and one reporting unit within the Graphics Segment.
One reporting unit previously reported in the Technology Segment has been transferred to the Lighting Segment as a result of the merge of the Technology Segment with the Lighting Segment (See Note 3).
A sustained and significant decline in the Company’s stock price in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 led management to believe that a triggering event occurred and that an interim goodwill impairment test was required for one of the reporting units in the Lighting Segment that contains goodwill, as of  September 30, 2017.
Because the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, the requirement to perform step 2 in the impairment test was not required.
The line of credit expires in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
The increment over the LIBOR borrowing rate, as periodically determined, fluctuates between 125 and 250 basis points depending upon the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), as defined in the line of credit agreement.
The increment over LIBOR borrowing rate will remain at 175 basis points for the next twelve months.
Under the terms of this line of credit, the Company has agreed to a negative pledge of real estate assets and is required to comply with financial covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
As of  December 31, 2017, there was $52.1 million borrowed against the line of credit, and $47.9 million was available as of that date.
Based on the terms of the line of credit and the maturity date, the debt has been classified as long term.
Dividends on restricted stock units in the amount of $38,463 and $19,826 were accrued as of  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
In  January 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable  February 13, 2018 to shareholders of record as of  February 5, 2018.
The indicated annual cash dividend rate is $0.20 per share.
The Company’s equity compensation plan, the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (“the 2012 Plan”), was approved by shareholders in  November 2012.
The 2012 Plan covers all of its full-time employees, outside directors and certain advisors and replaced all previous equity compensation plans.
In  November 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the 2012 Plan that added 1,600,000 shares to the plan and implemented the use of a fungible share ratio that consumes 2.5 available shares for every 1 full value share awarded by the Company as stock compensation.
The 2012 Plan allows for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock awards, and other stock awards.
Stock option grants or stock awards made pursuant to the 2012 Plan are granted at fair market value at the date of option grant or stock award.
Stock option grants  may be service-based or performance-based.
Service-based options granted during fiscal 2017 and prior fiscal years generally have a four year ratable vesting period beginning one year after the date of grant.
The maximum exercise period of stock options granted under the 2012 Plan is ten years.
If a stock option holder’s employment with the Company terminates by reason of death, disability or retirement, as defined in the Plan, the Plan generally provides for acceleration of vesting.
The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2012 Plan is 1,453,356 shares, all of which were available for future grant or award as of  December 31, 2017.
Service-based and performance-based stock options were granted and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were awarded during the six months ended  December 31, 2017.
As of  December 31, 2017, the approximate unvested stock option expense that will be recorded as expense in future periods is $2,563,987.
The weighted average time over which this expense will be recorded is approximately 24 months.
Additionally, as of  December 31, 2017, a total of 187,150 RSUs were outstanding.
The approximate unvested stock compensation expense that will be recorded as expense in future periods for the RSUs is $775,144.
The weighted average time over which this expense will be recorded is approximately 30 months.
The fair value of each option on the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
At  December 31, 2017, the 794,537 options granted during the first six months of fiscal 2018 to employees had exercise prices ranging from $5.92 to $6.54 per share, fair values ranging from of $1.71 to $1.96 per share, and remaining contractual lives of between 9.5 and 10 years.
At  December 31, 2016, the 834,320 options granted during the first six months of fiscal 2017 to employees had exercise prices ranging from $9.65 to $11.06 per share, fair values ranging from of $3.29 to $3.83 per share, and remaining contractual lives of between 9.5 and 10 years.
The Company calculates stock option expense using the Black-Scholes model.
Stock option expense is recorded on a straight line basis, or sooner if the grantee is retirement eligible as defined in the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, with an estimated 8.54% forfeiture rate effective  October 1, 2017.
The expected life of outstanding options is determined to be less than the contractual term for a period equal to the aggregate group of option holders’ estimated weighted average time within which options will be exercised.
The Company recorded $367,920 of expense in the three months ended  December 31, 2017 and recorded a reduction of expense of $142,434 in the three months ended  December 31, 2016, related to stock options.
The reduction of stock option expense in the three months ended  December 31, 2016 was the result of expectations that the performance criteria related to incentive based options will not be met.
The Company recorded $1,125,728 and $1,296,009 of expense related to stock options in the six months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
As of  December 31, 2017, the Company had 3,344,138 stock options that were vested and that were expected to vest, with a weighted average exercise price of $8.13 per share, an aggregate intrinsic value of $905,309 and weighted average remaining contractual terms of 7.4 years.
The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the six months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $22,079 and $99,883, respectively.
The aggregate grant date fair value of options that vested during the six months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1,793,086 and $1,779,490, respectively.
In the first six months of fiscal 2018 the Company recorded a $83,608 reduction of the federal income tax payable, $559,474 as an increase in common stock, $87,354 as a reduction of income tax expense, and $170,462 as a reduction of the deferred tax assets.
In the first six months of fiscal 2017 the Company recorded $95,443 as a reduction of federal income taxes payable, $124,056 as a decrease in common stock, $22,073 as a reduction of income tax expense, and $197,427 as a reduction of the deferred tax asset related to the issuance of RSUs and the exercises of stock options in which the employees sold the common shares prior to the passage of twelve months from the date of exercise.
A total of 91,490 RSUs with a fair value of $5.92 per share were awarded to employees during the six months ended  December 31, 2017.
A total of 71,700 RSUs with a fair value of $11.06 per share were awarded to employees during the six months ended  December 31, 2016.
The Company determined the fair value of the awards based on the closing price of the Company stock on the date the RSUs were awarded.
The RSUs have a four year ratable vesting period.
The RSUs are non-voting, but accrue cash dividends at the same per share rate as those cash dividends declared and paid on LSI’s common stock.
Dividends on RSUs in the amount of $38,463 and $19,826 were accrued as of  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Accrued dividends are paid to the holder upon vesting of the RSUs and issuance of shares.
As of  December 31, 2017, the 187,150 RSUs had a remaining contractual life of between 2.5 and 3.5 years.
Of the 187,150 RSUs outstanding as of  December 31, 2017, 176,073 RSUs are vested or expected to vest in the future.
An estimated forfeiture rate of 8.5% was used in the calculation of expense related to the RSUs.
The Company recorded $81,895 and $337,310 of expense related to RSUs in the three and six month periods ended  December 31, 2017, respectively.
As of  December 31, 2016, the 118,575 RSUs had a remaining contractual life of between 2.5 and 3.5 years.
Of the 118,575 RSUs outstanding as of  December 31, 2016, 114,531 RSUs are vested or expected to vest in the future.
An estimated forfeiture rate of 3.4% was used in the calculation of expense related to the RSUs.
The Company recorded $89,896 and $392,197 of expense related to RSUs in the three and six month periods ended  December 31, 2016, respectively.
The Company awarded a total of 19,920 and 21,199 common shares in the six months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as stock compensation awards.
These common shares were valued at their approximate $155,974 and $228,000 fair market values based on their stock price at dates of issuance multiplied by the number of common shares awarded, respectively, pursuant to the compensation programs for non-employee directors who receive a portion of their compensation as an award of Company stock and for employees who received a nominal recognition award in the form of Company stock.
Stock compensation awards are made in the form of newly issued common shares of the Company.
The Company has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan providing for both Company contributions and participant deferrals of compensation.
All plan investments are in common shares of the Company.
As of  December 31, 2017 there were 38 participants, all with fully vested account balances.
A total of 245,732 common shares with a cost of $2,187,811, and 257,898 common shares with a cost of $2,456,875 were held in the plan as of  December 31, 2017 and  June 30, 2017, respectively, and, accordingly, have been recorded as treasury shares.
The Company issued 42,280 new common shares for purposes of the non-qualified deferred compensation plan as of  December 31, 2017 and the company did not issue new common shares for plan in fiscal 2017.
The Company used approximately $106,537 and $390,288 to purchase 15,225 and 39,487 common shares of the Company in the open stock market during the six months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for either employee salary deferrals or Company contributions into the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
The Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation is no longer funded by purchases in the open market of LSI stock as of  September 30, 2017.
This plan is now solely funded by newly issued shares that are authorized from the Company’s 2012 Stock Incentive Plan.
The Company  may occasionally issue a standby letter of credit in favor of third parties.
As of  December 31, 2017, there were no standby letter of credit agreements.
The Company recorded severance expense of $83,000 and $173,000 in the six months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
This severance expense was related to reductions in staffing not related to plant restructuring.
See further discussion of restructuring expenses in Note 14.
The decision was based upon the market shift away from fluorescent and other technologies and the rapid movement to LED lighting which is produced at other LSI facilities.
The Company expects to continue to meet the demand for products containing fluorescent light sources as long as these products are commercially viable.
Fiscal 2017 restructuring costs related to the closure of the Kansas City facility were $944,000.
There have been no restructuring costs in fiscal 2018.
The write-down was related to inventory that was previously realizable until the decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to close the Kanas City plant due to the planned curtailment of the manufacturing of fluorescent light fixtures.
The Company also announced the consolidation of the Beaverton, Oregon facility into other LSI facilities.
This consolidation was completed  September 30, 2016.
In  November 2016, the Company announced the consolidation of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island manufacturing operation into its North Canton, Ohio operation.
The manufacturing operations in Woonsocket ceased prior to  December 31, 2016.
The Company owned the facility in Woonsocket and realized a small gain when the facility was sold in  September 2017.
Total restructuring costs related to the consolidation of the Woonsocket facility were $452,000 in fiscal 2017.
There have been no restructuring charges in fiscal 2018.
Management does not expect any significant restructuring charges for fiscal 2018.
All previously announced restructuring projects were completed in fiscal 2017 and all restructuring charges were recorded in fiscal 2017.
The above tables exclude the gain on the sale of the Kansas City and Woonsocket facilities.
Additionally, the above tables do not include expense of $400,000 recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 related to the write-down of inventory included as cost of sales as part of the Kansas City facility closure.
Refer to Note 13 for information regarding additional severance expenses that are not included in the restructuring costs identified in this footnote.
This continual estimation process often results in a change to the expected effective income tax rate for the year.
The Company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Act during the quarter.
