Any forward-looking statements we make herein are pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
All forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-Q are based upon information available to us as of the filing date of this Form 10-Q.
We undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason.
We discuss certain factors in greater detail in Business Overview below.
The terms fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 refer to our fiscal years ending April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Corporate capital spending trends and commitments are the primary determinants of the size of the market for business software.
In January 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided an update to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) for the 2018 and 2019 world economic growth forecast.
The update noted that, Global economic activity continues to firm up.
Global output is estimated to have grown by 3.7 percent in 2017, which is 0.1 percentage point faster than projected in the fall and  1⁄2 percentage point higher than in 2016.
The pickup in growth has been broad based, with notable upside surprises in Europe and Asia.
Global growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been revised upward by 0.2 percentage point to 3.9 percent.
The revision reflects increased global growth momentum and the expected impact of the recently approved U.S. tax policy changes.
For the remainder of fiscal 2018, we expect the global economy to improve when compared to the prior year, which could result in an improved selling environment.
Overall information technology spending is improving as a result of the current global economic environment.
We believe information technology spending will incrementally improve over the long term as increased global competition forces companies to improve productivity by upgrading their technology systems.
Customers continue to take long periods to evaluate discretionary software purchases.
We believe the improvement in economic conditions may be driving some businesses to invest in achieving more process and efficiency enhancements in their operations and to invest in solutions that improve operating margins, rather than make large infrastructure-type technology purchases.
If this trend continues, we believe it may tend to favor solutions such as our Logility supply chain solutions, which are designed to provide a more rapid return on investment and are targeted at some of the largest profit drivers in a customers business.
We provide our software solutions through three major business segments, which are further broken down into a total of six major product and service groups.
The three business segments are (1) Supply Chain Management (SCM), (2) Information Technology (IT) Consulting and (3) Other.
The SCM segment, consists of Logility, which provides supply chain optimization and advance retail planning solutions, as an integrated suite of sales and operations planning, demand optimization, inventory optimization, manufacturing planning and scheduling, supply optimization, retail allocation and merchandise planning and transportation optimization, as well as (i) DMI, which provides collaborative supply chain solutions to streamline and optimize the forecasting, inventory, production, supply, allocation, distribution and management of products between trading partners, (ii) New Generation Computing (NGC), which provides cloud solutions for supply chain management, product lifecycle management, quality control, vendor compliance and enterprise resource planning for both retailers and manufacturers in the apparel, sewn products and furniture industries, and, (iii) Halo, which provides advanced analytics and business intelligence solutions for the supply chain market.
We account for the development costs of software intended for sale in accordance with the IntangiblesGoodwill and Other topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification.
We monitor the net realizable value of our capitalized software on a quarterly basis based on an estimate of future product revenues.
We currently expect to fully recover the value of the capitalized software asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet; however, if future product revenues are less than managements current expectations, we may incur a write-down of capitalized software costs.
Our selling expenses generally include the salary and commissions paid to our sales professionals, along with marketing, promotional, travel and associated costs.
      Dependence on Capital Spending Patterns.
      Acquisition Risks.
More specifically, in any acquisition we will face risks and challenges associated with the uncertain value of the acquired business or assets, the difficulty of assimilating operations and personnel, integrating acquired technologies and products and maintaining the loyalty of the customers of the acquired business.
In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers  Deferral of Effective Date, which defers the implementation of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for one year from the initial effective date.
The Company has performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and is monitoring the activity of the FASB as it relates to specific interpretive guidance.
The Company plans to adopt ASU 2014-09, as well as other clarifications and technical guidance issued by the FASB related to this new revenue standard, on May 1, 2018.
Under this method, the Company would not restate the prior financial statements presented.
Therefore, the new standard would require additional disclosures of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the fiscal year 2019 reporting period.
In assessing the new standard, the Company has completed its review of representative contracts and identification of policy and differences resulting from the adoption of the new revenue standard.
The Company has drafted policy memos for all streams of revenue and expects to finalize by end of fiscal 2018.
The Company has also evaluated and is in the process of documenting internal controls over financial reporting surrounding the adoption of the standard and periodic reporting and disclosures.
The Company is still assessing the materiality of the standards adoption, including its impact on disclosures.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The 14% increase in revenues over the three months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year was attributable primarily to a 50% increase in license fee revenues and, to a lesser extent, a 9% increase in services and other revenues and a 5% increase in maintenance revenues.
The increase in license fee revenues was attributable to entering into several license fee agreements during the quarter in our SCM segment, due to an increase in general economic activity and higher overall business information technology spending from the US tax reform.
The primary reason for the increase in services and other revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2018 was an increase in implementation and cloud services in our SCM segment partially offset by a decrease in our IT consulting services due to decreased demand for IT temporary staff.
Due to intense competition in our industry, we do discount license fees from our published list price.
Numerous factors contribute to the amount of the discounts provided, such as previous customer purchases, the number of customer sites utilizing the software, the number of modules purchased and the number of users, as well as the overall size of the contract.
While all these factors may affect the discount amount of a particular contract, the overall percentage discount has not materially changed in the recent reported fiscal periods.
International revenues represented approximately 20% and 17% of total revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, license fee revenues increased 50% and 6%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year.
In the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, license fee revenues from our SCM business unit increased 49% and 6%, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year.
Our SCM business unit constituted 99% and 100% of total license fee revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our SCM business unit constituted 99% and 99% of total license fee revenues for the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our Other business unit license fee revenues increased by 627% for the three months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in the prior year and decreased 22% in the nine months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to timing of closing ERP deals.
The direct sales channel provided approximately 91% and 83% of license fee revenues for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, compared to approximately 81% in each of the comparable periods last year.
The increase in the proportion of sales by our direct sales channel was due to a larger increase in license fee revenue from the SCM segments direct sales channel.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 88% and 87%, respectively.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 87%.
The margins increased slightly in the current period due to the mix of sales commission rates based on each individual salespersons quotas and related achievement.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 32% and 41%, respectively.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 36% and 44%, respectively.
 current quarter and year to date decreased when compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the mix of value-added reseller (VAR) commission rates.
These margin calculations include only commission expense for comparative purposes and do not include other costs of license fees such as amortization of capitalized software.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, services revenue increased by 9% and 4%, respectively, primarily due to increased services revenues from our SCM business unit partially offset by a decrease in our IT consulting business unit.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, a 24% and 17% increase, respectively, at our SCM business unit was due to services revenue related to our Logility cloud services area and an increase in utilization from project implementation services from higher license fees in prior periods.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, our IT Consulting segments revenues decreased 11% and 12%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year due lower project work.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, services and other revenues from our Other segment increased by 52% and 8%, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the timing of implementation work.
ACV is a forward-looking operating measure used by management to better understand cloud services (SaaS and other related cloud services) revenue trends within our business, as it reflects our current estimate of revenue to be generated under existing client contracts in the forward 12-month period.
Our SCM Segment accounted for 97% and 96% of total maintenance revenues for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Typically, our maintenance revenues have had a direct relationship to current and historic license fee revenues, since new licenses are the potential source of new maintenance customers.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, our total gross margin percentage increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a higher license fee margin from higher license fees and for the nine months ended January 31, 2018, to a lesser extent, due to an increase in gross margins in services and other and maintenance revenues.
License fee gross margin percentage tends to be directly related to the level of license fee revenues due to the relatively fixed cost of computer software amortization expense, amortization of acquired software and the sales mix between our direct and indirect channels.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018, the gross margin percentage on services and other revenue increased by seven percentage points when compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in our Logility cloud services area which has higher margin services and related implementation services.
Services and other gross margin is directly related to the level of services and other revenues.
The primary component of cost of services and other revenues is services staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, the gross margin percentage had a slight uptick to 79% from 77%, respectively, primarily due to increased maintenance revenue and cost containment efforts.
Maintenance gross margin normally is directly related to the level of maintenance revenues.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, gross product research and development costs increased 5% and 1%, respectively when compared to the same periods in the previous year due increased headcount and related expenses.
Capitalized software development costs increased 20% and 48%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year due to timing of capitalizable project work.
We expect capitalized product development costs to remain consistent for the remainder of fiscal 2018 as compared to the third quarter of 2018, and we expect capitalized software amortization expense to be relatively stable in coming quarters.
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 remained flat at 18% as a percentage of revenue.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a slight reduction in sales and marketing expenses to 18% from 19% as a percentage of revenue, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, general and administrative expenses increased when compared to the same periods a year ago due to the purchase of Halo and variable compensation.
Our SCM segments operating income increased by 63% and 78% for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively, compared to same period last year primarily due to higher overall revenues and higher margin cloud services.
Our IT Consulting segment operating income decreased 44% and increased 11% for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively, when compared to the prior year due to lower revenues for the three month period and improved gross margins for the nine month period.
Our Other segment operating loss increased 26% and 14% in the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher corporate variable compensation and lower revenues.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018, the increase in other income was due primarily to a 1) higher unrealized gains on investments, 2) higher interest income and 3) an exchange rate gain of approximately $75,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to a loss of approximately $56,000 in the same period last year.
This increase was partially offset by lower rental income when compared to the same period last year as a result of our real estate sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2018, the increase in other income was due primarily to a 1) higher unrealized gains on investments, 2) higher interest income of $1,120,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to $882,000 in the same period in the prior year when compared to the same period last year and 3) higher exchange rate gains of approximately $75,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to a loss of approximately $236,000 in the same period last year.
This increase was partially offset by lower rental income of $263,000 when compared to $697,000 the same period last year as a result of our real estate sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
We recorded gains of approximately $997,000 and $1.4 million for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively, from our trading securities portfolio.
We recorded gains of approximately $564,000 and $170,000 the three and nine months ended January 31, 2017, respectively, from our trading securities portfolio.
We establish a deferred tax asset for the expected future benefit of net operating loss and credit carry-forwards.
This is the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first eight months of fiscal year 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the final four months of fiscal year 2018.
During the three months ended January 31, 2018, our effective tax rate was 3.4% compared to our effective tax rate of 35.5% in the three months ended January 31, 2017.
Our effective tax rates were lower in both the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018 than the same period last year because of the Act.
We expect this pattern to continue.
We have historically funded, and continue to fund, our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities.
We have no debt obligations or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, and therefore, we used no cash for debt service purposes.
The following table shows information about our cash flows and liquidity positions during the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017.
You should read this table and the discussion that follows in conjunction with our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Item 1.
Financial Statements in Part I of this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017.
The increase in cash used in investing activities when compared to the same period in the prior year was due primarily to the acquisition of Halo in the current quarter compared to the acquisition of AdapChain, Inc. in the prior year period and higher capitalized computer software development costs, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.
The decrease in cash used in financing activities compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid.
Our total activities used more cash and investments during the nine months ended January 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year period, due primarily to the operating results and changes in operating assets and liabilities as noted above.
This increase is primarily due to billing timing of cash collections.
Our business in recent periods has generated substantial positive cash flow from operations, excluding purchases and proceeds of sale of trading securities.
For this reason, and because we had $88.4 million in cash and investments with no debt as of January 31, 2018, we believe that our sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our presently anticipated requirements during at least the next twelve months for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate needs.
However, at some future date we may need to seek additional sources of capital to meet our requirements.
If such need arises, we may be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing.
We do not currently have a bank line of credit.
We can provide no assurance that bank lines of credit or other financing will be available on terms acceptable to us.
If available, such financing may result in dilution to our shareholders or higher interest expense.
Revenue Recognition.
We recognize revenue predominantly in accordance with the Software Revenue Recognition Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification.
We generally bill maintenance fees annually in advance and recognize the resulting revenues ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement.
We derive revenues from services which primarily include consulting, implementation, training, SaaS, hosting and managed services.
We bill for these services primarily under time and materials arrangements and recognize fees as we perform the services.
We record revenues from sales of third-party products in accordance with Principal Agent Considerations within the Revenue Recognition Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
Furthermore, we evaluate sales through our indirect channel on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the transaction should be recorded gross or net, including but not limited to assessing whether or not we (1) act as principal in the transaction, (2) take title to the products, (3) have risks and rewards of ownership, such as the risk of loss for collection, delivery, or returns, and (4) act as an agent or broker with compensation on a commission or fee basis.
Accordingly, our sales through the DMI channel are typically recorded on a gross basis.
Our sales frequently include maintenance contracts and professional services with the sale of our software licenses.
We have established VSOE for our maintenance contracts and professional services.
We determine fair value based upon the prices we charge to customers when we sell these elements separately.
We defer maintenance revenues, including those sold with the initial license fee, based on VSOE, and recognize the revenue ratably over the maintenance contract period.
We recognize consulting and training service revenues, including those sold with license fees, as we perform the services based on their established VSOE.
We determine the amount of revenue we allocate to the licenses sold with services or maintenance using the residual method of accounting.
Under the residual method, we allocate the total value of the arrangement first to the undelivered elements based on their VSOE and allocate the remainder to license fees.
SaaS revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription term as the customer has no ability to take delivery of the software, and the underlying arrangements typically include a single fee for the service that is billed monthly, quarterly or annually.
We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
In accordance with the Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic of the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification, we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Our goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, which require us to estimate the fair value of our business compared to the carrying value.
Should such review indicate the assets are impaired, we would record an expense for the impaired assets.
In accordance with the Property, Plant, and Equipment Topic of the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification, long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability would be measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
The determination of estimated future cash flows, however, requires management to make estimates.
Future events and changes in circumstances may require us to record a significant impairment charge in the period in which such events or changes occur.
Impairment testing requires considerable analysis and judgment in determining results.
 assets that we believed was impaired.
At January 31, 2018, our goodwill balance was $25.5 million and our intangible assets with definite lives balance was approximately $6.2 million, net of accumulated amortization.
Valuation of Capitalized Software Assets.
We capitalize certain computer software development costs in accordance with the Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic of the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification.
Capitalization ceases when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers.
We make ongoing evaluations of the recoverability of our capitalized software projects by comparing the amount capitalized for each product to the estimated net realizable value of the product.
If such evaluations indicate that the unamortized software development costs exceed the net realizable value, we write off the amount by which the unamortized software development costs exceed net realizable value.
We amortize capitalized computer software development costs ratably based on the projected revenues associated with the related software or on a straight-line basis over three years, whichever method results in a higher level of amortization.
Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in the cost of license revenues in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation.
We estimate the value of options granted on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Managements judgments and assumptions related to volatility, the expected term and the forfeiture rate are made in connection with the calculation of stock compensation expense.
We periodically review all assumptions used in our stock option pricing model.
Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the amount of stock compensation expense.
Business Combinations and Intangible Assets Including Goodwill.
We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based upon managements estimates of current fair values as of the acquisition date.
The estimation process includes analyses based on income and market approaches.
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets.
The goodwill generated is due in part to the synergies that are not included in the fair value of identifiable intangible assets.
Goodwill recorded in an acquisition is assigned to applicable reporting units based on expected revenues.
Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over there useful lives.
Amortization of current technology is recorded in cost of revenues-license and amortization of all other intangible assets is recorded in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.
