2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements.
We will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method upon adoption.
We have begun to assess the impact of the ASU on our financial statements, including the package of available practical expedients, required disclosures, and changes to internal controls.
Based on the preliminary work completed, we expect a material impact to our balance sheet through the recording of right-of-use assets and lease obligations that were not required to be recorded within the balance sheet under current accounting standards.
2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method of adoption.
The amendments in the ASU require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic cost (benefit) and report that component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period.
As a result of the ASU, the presentation of net periodic cost (benefit) has been updated to classify all components of our net periodic benefit, with the exception of the service cost component, within Other in Other income (expense) on the statement of operations.
We recorded $20 million and $4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively, and $40 million and $1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively.
2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," and all the related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to our opening retained earnings.
The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods.
We retained much of the same accounting treatment used to recognize revenue under ASC 606 as under accounting standards in effect in prior periods.
Services contracts continue to be recognized ratably over relevant contract terms as we stand ready to perform.
Finally, revenue on equipment sales continues to be recognized based on delivery terms as aligned with the transfer of control.
Under the new standard, revenue recognition for software sales is accelerated based on when control of software licenses and related support services are transferred to the customer.
Amounts deferred under previous software accounting rules due to a lack of vendor-specific objective evidence have been recognized as an adjustment through opening retained earnings.
 Historically, we presented transactions that involved a third-party sales representative on a net basis.
After considering the control concept and the remaining three indicators of gross presentation under the new standard, we have determined that we are the principal in contracts that involve a third-party sales representative.
Under prior accounting standards, we expensed sales commissions and other costs to obtain a contract as incurred.
However, under the new standard, we capitalize sales commissions and certain other costs as incremental costs to obtain a contract.
The new standard clarified the definition of a receivable and requires us to present our net position in a contract with a customer on the balance sheet.
The position is presented as either a receivable, contract asset, or a contract liability.
Contract assets represent rights to consideration from a customer in exchange for transferred goods and services that are conditional on events other than the passage of time.
Contract liabilities represent obligations to transfer goods and services for which we have received, or is due, consideration from a customer respectively.
We reclassified our customer positions to align with the new definitions and presentation guidance.
Accounts receivable which are not due from customers have been reclassified into Other current assets.
