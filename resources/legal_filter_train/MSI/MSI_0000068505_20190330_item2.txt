We did not elect the "use-of hindsight" practical expedient to determine the lease term or in assessing the likelihood that a lease purchase option will be exercised, allowing us to carry forward the lease term as determined prior to adoption of ASC 842.
ASC 842 also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting.
For those leases that qualify, the exemption allows us to not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, including not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases at transition.
Short-term lease costs are recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term consistent with our prior accounting.
We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all current lease categories.
We recognized operating lease liabilities of $648 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments determined under prior lease accounting standards and corresponding ROU assets of $588 million.
The $60 million difference between operating lease liabilities and ROU assets recognized is due to deferred rent and exit cost accruals recorded under prior lease accounting standards.
