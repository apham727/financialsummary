The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits, claims, and actions, which arise in the normal course of business.

Item 1A.
We are subject to laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal obligations could adversely affect our business.
The GDPR strengthens individual privacy rights and enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data.
This includes expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information and mandatory data breach notification requirements.
Non-compliance with the GDPR can trigger fines of up to €20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater.
Also, U.S. federal, state and other foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, use, processing and disclosure personal data.
Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing practices or the features of our products, services and software.
In addition to the risk factor above, the reader should carefully consider, in connection with the other information in this report, the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A: Risk Factors” on pages 8 through 20 of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
