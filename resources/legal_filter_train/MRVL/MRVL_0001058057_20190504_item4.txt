Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of May 4, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systemâ€™s objectives will be met.
The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
