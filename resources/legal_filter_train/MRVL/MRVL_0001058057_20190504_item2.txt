We are a leading supplier of infrastructure semiconductor solutions, spanning the data center core to network edge. We are a fabless semiconductor supplier of high-performance standard and semi-custom products with core strengths in developing and scaling complex System-on-a-Chip architectures integrating analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing functionality. Leveraging leading intellectual property and deep system-level expertise as well as highly innovative security firmware, our solutions are empowering the data economy and enabling virtually instantaneous communications across 5G, cloud, automotive, industrial and artificial intelligence applications. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, our net revenue increased year over year by 9.6% from $604.6 million net revenue in the first quarter fiscal 2019 compared with $662.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased sales of our networking products by 40% with sales benefiting from our acquisition of Cavium. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in our storage product sales and other product sales, which decreased by 12% and 2%, respectively, in relation to the three months ended May 5, 2018. 
As we enter the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we are monitoring the near term geopolitical uncertainty and the recent ban on shipments to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Huawei”). The following discussion reflects our current assessment of the near term impact of this uncertainty. 
Subsequent to quarter end, on May 20, 2019, we announced our intent to acquire Avera Semiconductor (“Avera”), the application specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) business of GlobalFoundries Inc. (“GlobalFoundries”). This acquisition brings together Avera's leading custom design capabilities with our advanced technology platform and scale, creating a leading ASIC supplier for wired and wireless infrastructure. The agreements include transfer of Avera's revenue base, strategic design wins with leading infrastructure original equipment manufacturers, and a new long-term wafer supply agreement between GlobalFoundries and us. We will pay GlobalFoundries $650 million in cash at closing plus an additional $90 million in cash if certain business conditions are satisfied within the next 15 months. The transaction is expected to close by January 2020 pending receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Subsequent to the quarter end, on May 29, 2019, we announced our intent to sell our wi-fi connectivity business to NXP for $1.76 billion in cash. The divestiture encompasses our wi-fi and bluetooth technology portfolios and related assets. The business employs approximately 550 people worldwide and generated approximately $300 million in revenue in our fiscal 2019. This transaction has been approved by the board of directors of NXP and our board of directors and is expected to close by March 2020, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
Capital Return Program. We remain committed to delivering shareholder value through our share repurchase and dividend programs. On October 16, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $700 million addition to the balance of our existing share repurchase plan. Under the program authorized by our Board of Directors, we may repurchase shares in the open-market or through privately negotiated transactions. The extent to which we repurchase our shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations, as determined by our management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of May 4, 2019, there was $904 million remaining available for future share repurchases.
For the three months ended May 4, 2019, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock for $50.0 million. As of May 4, 2019, a total of 294.8 million shares have been repurchased to date under the Company’s share repurchase programs for a total $3.9 billion in cash. We returned $89.5 million to stockholders in the three months ended May 4, 2019, including our repurchases of common stock and $39.5 million of cash dividends. 
Cash and Short Term Investments. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $571.9 million at May 4, 2019, which was slightly lower than our balance at our fiscal year ended February 2, 2019 of $582.4 million. 
We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of our major customers and distributors and believe the distributors’ sales to diverse end customers and geographies further serve to mitigate our exposure to credit risk.
Most of our sales are made to customers located outside of the United States, primarily in Asia, and all of our products are manufactured outside the United States. Sales shipped to customers with operations in Asia represented approximately 80% of our net revenue in the three months ended May 4, 2019, and approximately 94% of net revenue in the three months ended May 5, 2018, respectively. Because many manufacturers and manufacturing subcontractors of our customers are located in Asia, we expect that most of our net revenue will continue to be represented by sales to our customers in that region. For risks related to our global operations, see Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” including but not limited to the risk detailed under the caption “We face additional risks due to the extent of our global operations since a majority of our products, and those of our customers, are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. The occurrence of any or a combination of the additional risks described below would significantly and negatively impact our business and results of operations.”
Our net revenue for the three months ended May 4, 2019 increased by $57.8 million compared to net revenue for the three months ended May 5, 2018. This was primarily due to increased sales of our networking products by 40% with sales benefiting from our acquisition of Cavium. This increase was partially offset by decreased sales of our storage products and other products, which were down 12% and 2% respectively, compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018. 
In the three months ended May 4, 2019, unit shipments were 50% lower and average selling prices increased 41% compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018. 
Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was higher for the three months ended May 4, 2019 compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018. The increase primarily consisted of $60 million of amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets from our acquisition of Cavium. As a result, gross margin for the three months ended May 4, 2019 decreased 7.5 percentage points compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018. 
Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $37.7 million in the three months ended May 4, 2019 compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018. The increase was primarily due to additional costs from our acquisition of Cavium, including $19.8 million of intangibles amortization expense, $18.2 million of higher employee personnel-related costs, $3.3 million of higher depreciation and amortization expense, $3.0 million of higher facility-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $5.6 million of lower merger-related costs.
We recognized $5.7 million of total restructuring related charges in the three months ended May 4, 2019 as the Company continues to evaluate its existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability. See “Note 9 - Restructuring and Other Related Charges” for further information. 
Interest income decreased by $4.8 million in the three months ended May 4, 2019, compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of investments in fiscal 2019. 
Interest expense increased by $21.0 million in the three months ended May 4, 2019, compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018. The increase is primarily due to interest expense incurred resulting from the issuance of our 2023 Notes, 2028 Notes and amounts borrowed under our credit agreement. 
Other income (loss), net, was a loss of $0.1 million in the three months ended May 4, 2019, compared to a gain of $1.5 million in the three months ended May 5, 2018. This was primarily due to the foreign currency gain related to the revaluation of foreign currency denominated tax liabilities in the three months ended May 5, 2018. 
Our principal source of liquidity as of May 4, 2019 consisted of approximately $572 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $543 million was held by subsidiaries outside of Bermuda. We plan to use such amounts to fund various activities outside of Bermuda, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures for expansion, funding of future acquisitions or other financing activities.
In June 2018, we executed debt agreements to obtain a $900 million term loan and $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in order to fund the Cavium acquisition. In addition, we executed a debt agreement in June 2018 to obtain a $500 million Revolving Credit Facility, which was undrawn as of May 4, 2019. See “Note 8 - Debt” for further information. 
To the extent that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments together with cash generated by operations, and funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing. We may also acquire additional businesses, purchase assets or enter into other strategic arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek debt or equity financing. Additional equity financing or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current shareholders. If we elect to raise additional funds, we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common shares.
For the three months ended May 5, 2018, net cash provided by investing activities of $216.7 million was primarily driven by net proceeds for sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities and time deposits of $274.1 million, offset by purchases of available-for-sale securities and time deposits of $38.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of $13.6 million. 
We presented our contractual obligations at February 2, 2019 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended. There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in those obligations during the three months ended May 4, 2019. 
See “Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
There were no sales of unregistered equity securities during the three months ended May 4, 2019.
