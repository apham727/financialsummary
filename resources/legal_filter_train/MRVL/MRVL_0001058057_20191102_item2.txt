We are a leading supplier of infrastructure semiconductor solutions, spanning the data center core to network edge.
We are a fabless semiconductor supplier of high-performance standard and semi-custom products with core strengths in developing and scaling complex System-on-a-Chip architectures integrating analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing functionality.
Leveraging leading intellectual property and deep system-level expertise as well as highly innovative security firmware, our solutions are empowering the data economy and enabling communications across 5G, cloud, automotive, industrial and artificial intelligence applications.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, our net revenue decreased year over year by 22% from $851.1 million net revenue in the third quarter fiscal 2019 compared with $662.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.
The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of our storage products by 29%, networking product sales by 17% and other product sales by 2%.
Our net revenue for the nine months ended November 2, 2019 decreased by $139.5 million compared to net revenue for the nine months ended November 3, 2018.
The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of our storage products by 21%.
We continue to expect our revenue in the current period to remain impacted by the U.S. Government’s export restrictions on certain Chinese customers.
On May 29, 2019, we announced our intent to sell our Wi-Fi connectivity business to NXP for $1.76 billion in cash.
The divestiture encompasses our Wi-Fi and bluetooth technology portfolios and related assets.
The business employs approximately 550 people worldwide and generated approximately $300 million in revenue in our fiscal 2019.
This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.
As of November 2, 2019, we classified assets held for sale of $600.9 million, which consisted of $30.1 million of inventory, $7.3 million of property, plant and equipment, $557.8 million of goodwill and $5.6 million of right-of-use lease asset.
The purchase price will be subject to working capital and other customary adjustments which will be determined at close.
Subsequent to quarter end, on November 5, 2019, we acquired Avera Semiconductor (“Avera”), the Application Specific Integrated Circuit (“ASIC”) business of GlobalFoundries (“GlobalFoundries”) for $597.5 million in cash at closing.
An additional $90 million in cash will be paid if certain conditions are satisfied within the next 15 months.
Avera is a leading provider of Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) semiconductor solutions.
We acquired Avera to expand our ASIC Design capabilities.
The merger consideration was funded with new debt financing.
See Note 8, “Debt” for additional information.
We remain committed to delivering shareholder value through our share repurchase and dividend programs.
On October 16, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $700 million addition to the balance of our existing share repurchase program.
Under the program authorized by our Board of Directors, we may repurchase shares in the open-market or through privately negotiated transactions.
The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
During the three months ended November 2, 2019, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in anticipation of the funding of our acquisition of Aquantia.
Therefore, there were no share repurchases during the three months ended November 2, 2019.
Although share repurchases are temporarily suspended, as of November 2, 2019, there was $890 million remaining available for future share repurchases.
For the nine months ended November 2, 2019, we repurchased 3.0 million shares of our common stock for $64.3 million.
As of November 2, 2019, a total of 295.4 million shares have been repurchased to date under our share repurchase programs for a total $3.9 billion in cash.
We returned $183.8 million to stockholders in the nine months ended November 2, 2019, including our repurchases of common stock and $119.5 million of cash dividends.
Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $438.4 million at November 2, 2019, which was lower than our balance at our fiscal year ended February 2, 2019 of $582.4 million.
The decrease in cash was primarily driven by the purchase consideration paid in connection with the Aquantia acquisition.
We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of our major customers and distributors and believe the distributors’ sales to diverse end customers and geographies further serve to mitigate our exposure to credit risk.
Sales shipped to customers with operations in Asia represented approximately 83% and 82% of our net revenue in the three and nine months ended November 2, 2019, and approximately 82% and 88% of net revenue in the three and nine months ended November 3, 2018, respectively.
Our net revenue for the three months ended November 2, 2019 decreased by $188.6 million compared to net revenue for the three months ended November 3, 2018.
This was primarily due to decreased sales of our storage, networking, and other products by 29%, 17% and 2% respectively, compared to the three months ended November 3, 2018.
In addition, sales of our storage products were impacted by rebalancing of inventory levels in our customers' supply chains, softening demand in gaming and video surveillance applications and the ongoing shift from HDD's to SSD's in personal computers.
The sales of our networking products were also impacted particularly by demand weakness from the enterprise end market.
Our net revenue for the nine months ended November 2, 2019 decreased by $139.5 million compared to net revenue for the nine months ended November 3, 2018.
This was primarily due to decreased sales of our storage products by 21%, compared to the nine months ended November 3, 2018.
The decreased sales of our storage products were primarily due to broad macroeconomic-related demand weakness, rebalancing of inventory levels in our customers' supply chains, softening demand in gaming and video surveillance and the ongoing shift from HDD's to SSD's in personal computers.
In the three months ended November 2, 2019, unit shipments were 11% lower and average selling prices decreased 10% compared to the three months ended November 3, 2018.
In the nine months ended November 2, 2019, unit shipments were 19% lower and average selling prices increased 10% compared to the nine months ended November 3, 2018.
Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was lower for the three months ended November 2, 2019 compared to the three months ended November 3, 2018, which primarily resulted from the fiscal 2019 amortization of inventory fair value adjustment associated with the Cavium acquisition, partially offset by increased costs from amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2020.
As a result, gross margin for the three months ended November 2, 2019 increased 6.2 percentage points compared to the three months ended November 3, 2018.
Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was higher for the nine months ended November 2, 2019 compared to the nine months ended November 3, 2018, driven by increased costs from amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2020, partially offset by the fiscal 2019 amortization of inventory fair value adjustment associated with the Cavium acquisition.
As a result, gross margin for the nine months ended November 2, 2019 decreased 0.5 percentage points compared to the nine months ended November 3, 2018.
Research and development expenses increased by $2.9 million in the three months ended November 2, 2019 compared to the three months ended November 3, 2018.
Research and development expenses increased by $143.1 million in the nine months ended November 2, 2019 compared to the nine months ended November 3, 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $6.8 million in the three months ended November 2, 2019 compared to the three months ended November 3, 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $24.8 million in the nine months ended November 2, 2019 compared to the nine months ended November 3, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to additional costs associated with our acquisition of Cavium and Aquantia, including $32.2 million of higher intangibles amortization expense, $4.9 million of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a $5.5 million SEC settlement as discussed in “Note 10.
Commitments and Contingencies,” partially offset by lower integration costs of $19.2 million as the Cavium acquisition.
We recognized $14.8 million and $37.1 million of total restructuring related charges in the three and nine months ended November 2, 2019 as we continue to evaluate our existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability.
See “Note 9 - Restructuring and Other Related Charges” for further information.
The decrease was primarily due to the sale of investments in fiscal 2019.
The decrease was primarily due to lower outstanding term loan balances.
The increase was primarily due to interest expense incurred for a full nine months in fiscal 2020 resulting from the issuance of our 2023 Notes, 2028 Notes and amounts borrowed under our credit agreement.
Other income (loss), net, changed by $3.3 million in the three months ended November 2, 2019 compared to the three months ended November 3, 2018.
The change was primarily due to the receipt of proceeds in the current period from the sale of a business in fiscal 2019 compared with a loss from the sale of a business in the prior period.
 Other income (loss), net, changed by $2.2 million in the nine months ended November 3, 2018 compared to the nine months ended November 3, 2018.
The change was primarily due to the realized loss on the sale of investments and the sale of a business in fiscal 2019, which was partially offset by foreign currency gain related to the revaluation of foreign currency denominated tax liabilities in the prior period and the receipt of proceeds in the current period from the sale of a business in fiscal 2019.
Our income tax expense for the three months ended November 2, 2019 was $1.5 million compared to a tax expense of $9.3 million for the three months ended November 3, 2018.
Our income tax expense for the three months ended November 2, 2019 differs from the same period in the prior year primarily due to a reduction in our U.S. pre-tax losses in the period, combined with a decrease of uncertain tax benefits recorded in the three months ended November 3, 2018.
Our income tax benefit for the nine months ended November 2, 2019 was $1.7 million compared to a tax benefit of $16.9 million for the nine months ended November 3, 2018.
Our income tax benefit for the nine months ended November 2, 2019 differs from the same period in the prior year primarily due to a reduction in our U.S. pre-tax losses in the period, combined with a decrease of uncertain tax benefits recorded in the nine months ended November 3, 2018.
Our principal source of liquidity as of November 2, 2019 consisted of approximately $438 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $388 million was held by subsidiaries outside of Bermuda.
In June 2018, we executed debt agreements to obtain a $900 million term loan and $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in order to fund the Cavium acquisition.
In addition, we executed a debt agreement in June 2018 to obtain a $500 million Revolving Credit Facility.
On September 17, 2019, we drew down $350 million on the Revolving Credit Facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Aquantia acquisition.
See “Note 8 - Debt” for additional information.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, and funds from our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements and any declared dividends, repurchase of our common stock and commitments for at least the next twelve months.
To the extent that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments together with cash generated by operations, and funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing.
Additional equity financing or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current shareholders.
In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common shares.
During the three months ended November 2, 2019, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in anticipation of the funding of our acquisition of Aquantia.
For the nine months ended November 2, 2019, net cash used in investing activities of $525.4 million was primarily driven by net cash paid to acquire Aquantia of $477.6 million, purchases of property and equipment of $62.9 million, and purchases of technology licenses of $1.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from sale of available-for-sale securities acquired from Aquantia of $18.8 million.
These outflows were partially offset by $350.0 million proceeds from issuance of debt and $103.1 million proceeds from employee stock plans.
We presented our contractual obligations at February 2, 2019 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended.
There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in those obligations during the three and nine months ended November 2, 2019, other than the draw down of the Revolving Credit Facility described at “Note 8 - Debt”.
See “Note 8 - Debt” for further information.
See “Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
There were no sales of unregistered equity securities during the three months ended November 2, 2019.
During the three months ended November 2, 2019, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in anticipation of the funding of our acquisition of Aquantia.
Therefore, there were no share repurchases during the three months ended November 2, 2019.
Although share repurchases are temporarily suspended, we have $890.0 million of repurchase authority remaining under our current share repurchase program.
