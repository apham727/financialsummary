We are a leading supplier of infrastructure semiconductor solutions, spanning the data center core to network edge.
We are a fabless semiconductor supplier of high-performance standard and semi-custom products with core strengths in developing and scaling complex System-on-a-Chip architectures integrating analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing functionality.
Leveraging leading intellectual property and deep system-level expertise as well as highly innovative security firmware, our solutions are empowering the data economy and enabling communications across 5G, cloud, automotive, industrial and artificial intelligence applications.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, our net revenue decreased year over year by 1% from $665.3 million net revenue in the second quarter fiscal 2019 compared with $656.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of our storage products by 18%.
Our net revenue for the six months ended August 3, 2019 increased by $49.1 million compared to net revenue for the six months ended August 4, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to increased sales of our networking products and other products by 27% and 6%, respectively, with sales benefiting from our acquisition of Cavium.
The growth was partially offset by decreased sales of our storage products, which decreased by 15% in relation to the six months ended August 4, 2018.
As we enter the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we are monitoring the near term geopolitical uncertainty and the recent ban on shipments to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Huawei”).
The US government export restrictions on Huawei were implemented in the second week of our second quarter of fiscal year 2020, limiting revenue from that customer to shipments during a short period during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.
On May 6, 2019, we announced our intent to acquire Aquantia, Corp. (“Aquantia”), a publicly traded company.
We will pay Aquantia's stockholders $13.25 per share in cash, or approximately $480 million.
The transaction is expected to close by December 2019, subject to regulatory approval as well as other customary closing conditions.
On July 10, 2019, Aquantia's stockholders approved the merger agreement.
On May 20, 2019, we announced our intent to acquire Avera Semiconductor (“Avera”), the application specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) business of GlobalFoundries Inc. (“GlobalFoundries”).
This acquisition brings together Avera's leading custom design capabilities with our advanced technology platform and scale, creating a leading ASIC supplier for wired and wireless infrastructure.
The agreements include transfer of Avera's revenue base, strategic design wins with leading infrastructure original equipment manufacturers, and a new long-term wafer supply agreement between GlobalFoundries and us.
We will pay GlobalFoundries $650 million in cash at closing, subject to certain adjustments, plus an additional $90 million in cash if certain business conditions are satisfied within the next 15 months.
The transaction is expected to close by January 2020 pending receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
On May 29, 2019, we announced our intent to sell our Wi-Fi connectivity business to NXP for $1.76 billion in cash.
The business employs approximately 550 people worldwide and generated approximately $300 million in revenue in our fiscal 2019.
This transaction is expected to close by the first quarter of calendar 2020, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
As of August 3, 2019, we classified assets held for sale of $597.7 million, which consisted of $28.2 million of inventory, $6.1 million of property, plant and equipment, $557.8 million of goodwill, $5.6 million of right-of-use asset, and classified liabilities held for sale of $5.6 million associated with lease liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
We remain committed to delivering shareholder value through our share repurchase and dividend programs.
On October 16, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $700 million addition to the balance of our existing share repurchase program.
Under the program authorized by our Board of Directors, we may repurchase shares in the open-market or through privately negotiated transactions.
The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
As of August 3, 2019, there was $890 million remaining available for future share repurchases.
For the six months ended August 3, 2019, we repurchased 3.0 million shares of our common stock for $64.3 million.
As of August 3, 2019, a total of 295.4 million shares have been repurchased to date under the Company’s share repurchase programs for a total $3.9 billion in cash.
We returned $143.7 million to stockholders in the six months ended August 3, 2019, including our repurchases of common stock and $79.4 million of cash dividends.
Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $573.5 million at August 3, 2019, which was slightly lower than our balance at our fiscal year ended February 2, 2019 of $582.4 million.
Sales shipped to customers with operations in Asia represented approximately 82% and 81% of our net revenue in the three and six months ended August 3, 2019, and approximately 89% and 91% of net revenue in the three and six months ended August 4, 2018, respectively.
Because many manufacturers and manufacturing subcontractors of our customers are located in Asia, we expect that most of our net revenue will continue to be represented by sales to our customers in that region.
Our net revenue for the three months ended August 3, 2019 decreased by $8.7 million compared to net revenue for the three months ended August 4, 2018.
This was primarily due to decreased sales of our storage products by 18%.
This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our networking products and other products, which were up 16% and 13% respectively, compared to the three months ended August 4, 2018 with sales benefiting from our acquisition of Cavium.
Our net revenue for the six months ended August 3, 2019 increased by $49.1 million compared to net revenue for the six months ended August 4, 2018.
This was primarily due to increased sales of our networking products and other products by 27% and 6% respectively, with sales benefiting from our acquisition of Cavium.
This increase was partially offset by decreased sales of our storage products, which were down 15%, compared to the six months ended August 4, 2018.
In the three months ended August 3, 2019, unit shipments were 16% lower and average selling prices increased 13% compared to the three months ended August 4, 2018.
In the six months ended August 3, 2019, unit shipments were 30% lower and average selling prices increased 26% compared to the six months ended August 4, 2018.
Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was higher for the three and six months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the three and six months ended August 4, 2018, which primarily resulted from increased costs from amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2020, partially offset by the amortization of inventory fair value adjustment associated with the Cavium acquisition which only existed in fiscal 2019.
As a result, gross margin for the three and six months ended August 3, 2019 decreased 3.3 and 5.3 percentage points compared to the three and six months ended August 4, 2018.
Research and development expenses increased by $50.1 million in the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the three months ended August 4, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to $48.0 million of higher employee personnel-related costs from our acquisition of Cavium.
Research and development expenses increased $140.2 million in the six months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the six months ended August 4, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to $132.3 million of higher employee personnel-related costs from our acquisition of Cavium.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $19.7 million in the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the three months ended August 4, 2018.
The decrease was primarily due to $24.7 million of lower employee personnel-related costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $18.0 million in the six months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the six months ended August 4, 2018.
We recognized $16.6 million and $22.3 million of total restructuring related charges in the three and six months ended August 3, 2019 as the Company continues to evaluate its existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability.
See “Note 9 - Restructuring and Other Related Charges” for further information.
The decrease is primarily due to the sale of investments in fiscal 2019.
The increase is primarily due to interest expense incurred resulting from the issuance of our 2023 Notes, 2028 Notes and amounts borrowed under our credit agreement.
Other income (loss), net, changed by $0.5 million in the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the three months ended August 4, 2018.
The change is primarily due to the realized loss on the sale of investments in the three months ended August 4, 2018, which was partially offset by foreign currency losses from foreign tax reserves and transaction costs during the three months ended August 3, 2019.
Our income tax benefit for the three months ended August 3, 2019 was $10.5 million compared to a tax benefit of $30.0 million for the three months ended August 4, 2018.
Our income tax benefit for the three months ended August 3, 2019 differs from the same period in the prior year primarily due to a reduction in our U.S. pre-tax losses in the period.
Our income tax benefit for the six months ended August 3, 2019 was $3.3 million compared to a tax benefit of $26.2 million for the six months ended August 4, 2018.
Our income tax benefit for the six months ended August 3, 2019 differs from the same period in the prior year primarily due to a reduction in our U.S. pre-tax losses in the period.
Our principal source of liquidity as of August 3, 2019 consisted of approximately $573 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $496 million was held by subsidiaries outside of Bermuda.
In June 2018, we executed debt agreements to obtain a $900 million term loan and $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in order to fund the Cavium acquisition.
In addition, we executed a debt agreement in June 2018 to obtain a $500 million Revolving Credit Facility, which was undrawn as of August 3, 2019.
See “Note 8 - Debt” for further information.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, and funds from our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements and any declared dividends, repurchase of our common stock and commitments for at least the next twelve months.
To the extent that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments together with cash generated by operations, and funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing.
Additional equity financing or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current shareholders.
In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common shares.
For the six months ended August 3, 2019, net cash used in investing activities of $44.1 million was primarily driven by purchases of property and equipment of $42.2 million and purchases of technology licenses of $1.5 million.
These outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $81.3 million from employee stock plans.
We presented our contractual obligations at February 2, 2019 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended.
There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in those obligations during the three months ended August 3, 2019.
See “Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
During the three months ended August 3, 2019, there were no sales by us of unregistered securities that were not previously reported by us in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
