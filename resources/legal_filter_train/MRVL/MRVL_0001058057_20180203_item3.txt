Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
To provide an assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio, excluding time deposits. Based on investment positions as of May 5, 2018, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.5 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Due to our positive cash flow from operations, the relatively short-term nature of our investment portfolio and our ability to hold investments to maturity, such change in fair market value would likely not have resulted in any significant cash flow impact.
