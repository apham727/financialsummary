Applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances.
These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase.
While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed-income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other-than-temporary.
As of July 29, 2018, the carrying amount of long-term debt issued by Applied was $5.3 billion with an estimated fair value of $5.6 billion.
A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of Appliedâ€™s long-term debt issuances of approximately $531 million as of July 29, 2018.
Applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 24 months.
Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized.
