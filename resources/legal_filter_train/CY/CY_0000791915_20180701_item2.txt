Refer to Part I Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a discussion of our strategies.
Our total revenues increased by $30.3 million, or 5.1%, to $624.1 million for the three-month period ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by strength in wired and wireless connectivity, microcontrollers, and memory products.
Our total revenues increased by $80.7 million, or 7.2%, to $1,206.3 million for the six-month period ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by strength in wired and wireless connectivity, microcontrollers, and memory products.
Revenues recorded by MCD increased by $8.0 million, or 2.2%, in the three months ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by the growth in wired and wireless connectivity and microcontroller products. The overall average selling price ("ASP") of our products for MCD for the three months ended July 1, 2018 was $1.02 which decreased by $0.04, compared with the same prior year period primarily due to changes in product mix.
Revenues recorded by MCD increased by $26.8 million, or 4.0%, in the six months ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by growth in the wired and wireless connectivity and microcontroller products. The overall ASP of our products for MCD for the six months ended July 1, 2018 was $1.02 which decreased by $0.07, compared with the same prior year period primarily due to changes in product mix.
Revenues recorded by MPD increased by $22.3 million, or 9.6%, in the three months ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to growth in revenue from Flash memory products. The overall ASP of our products for MPD for the three months ended July 1, 2018 was $1.65, which increased by $0.35, compared with the same prior year period. The increase is primarily attributed to higher ASPs for Flash memory products and changes in product mix.
Revenues recorded by MPD increased by $53.9 million, or 12.1%, in the six months ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to growth in revenue from the Flash memory products. The overall ASP of our products for MPD for the six months ended July 1, 2018 was $1.64, which increased by $0.36, compared with the same prior year period. The increase is primarily attributed to higher ASPs for Flash memory products and changes in product mix.
Our gross margin improved to 37.5% in the three months ended July 1, 2018 from 32.5% in the three months ended July 2, 2017. The primary drivers of the improvement in gross margin were an increase in selling prices, higher fab utilization, which increased from 74.6% in the three months ended July 2, 2017 to 82.9% in the three months ended July 1, 2018, and a reduction in the cost of certain products. Additionally, there was a reduction in write-downs of carrying value of inventory during the three months ended July 1, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period. Write-down of inventories during the three months ended July 1, 2018 was $6.8 million as compared to $9.0 million in the three months ended July 2, 2017. Write-down of inventories unfavorably impacted our gross margin by 1.1% and 1.5% for the three months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017, respectively. Sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down aggregated to $7.6 million and $11.3 million for the second quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, which favorably impacted our gross margin by 1.2% and 1.9%, respectively. Included in the cost of revenues are restructuring costs of $1.6 million for the three months ended July 1, 2018. There was no restructuring cost for the three months ended July 2, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, we initiated the 2018 Plan which will contribute towards increasing longer term operational efficiency. The 2018 Plan will result in a reduction of approximately 75 positions, which is expected to favorably impact costs in the second half of 2018. Included in the cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $48.1 million and $44.3 million for the second quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
•stock-based compensation expense of $52.4 million;
•loss on disposal and impairment of property and equipment of $7.2 million;
•our share in the net loss of an equity method investee of $7.2 million; and
•restructuring costs and other adjustments of $3.6 million
•an increase in other current and long-term assets of $17.7 million for prepayments for licenses and other vendors;
•an increase in inventories of $14.0 million to support expected demand of MCD products for the second half of 2018; and 
•a decrease in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities of $7.3 million mainly due to timing of payments to vendors;
•partially offset by proceeds of $18.5 million from the sale of a cost method investment and $4.6 million in net distributions for the deferred compensation plan
•a $10.0 million outlay related to the repurchase of stock; and
•partially offset by proceeds of $36.7 million from employee equity awards. 
Our long-term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest-bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities, payments of regularly scheduled cash dividends, repayment of debt, and share repurchases. As of July 1, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance was $112.7 million as compared to $151.6 million as of December 31, 2017. As of July 1, 2018, approximately 30.5% of our cash was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. While these amounts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, a portion is denominated in foreign currencies. All non-U.S. cash balances are exposed to local political, banking, currency control, and other risks. In addition, these amounts, if repatriated, may be subject to tax and other transfer restrictions. 
As discussed in Note 1, we adopted Topic 606 on January 1, 2018. There have been no other changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The table below summarizes information with respect to repurchases of common stock made in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 under the $450 million stock buyback program.
