Our gross margin improved to 37.5% in the three months ended July 1, 2018 from 32.5% in the three months ended July 2, 2017.
Additionally, there was a reduction in write-downs of carrying value of inventory during the three months ended July 1, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period.

There was no restructuring cost for the three months ended July 2, 2017.
During the first quarter of 2018, we initiated the 2018 Plan which will contribute towards increasing longer term operational efficiency.
The 2018 Plan will result in a reduction of approximately 75 positions, which is expected to favorably impact costs in the second half of 2018.
Our gross margin improved to 37.0% in the six months ended July 1, 2018 from 31.1% in the six months ended July 2, 2017.

In December 2017, we entered into fixed-for-floating interest rate forward swap agreements with two counterparties, to swap variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments; these agreements will expire in July 2021.
The objective of the swap was to effectively fix the interest rate at current levels without having to refinance the outstanding term loan, thereby avoiding the incurrence of transaction costs.
Our long-term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest-bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities, payments of regularly scheduled cash dividends, repayment of debt, and share repurchases.
As of July 1, 2018, approximately 30.5% of our cash was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
While these amounts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, a portion is denominated in foreign currencies.
As of July 1, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under all of our debt facilities.
