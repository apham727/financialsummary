The portfolio includes Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth® and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Wi-Fi plus Bluetooth combo solutions; Traveo™ automotive MCUs, PSoC® programmable MCUs and general-purpose MCUs; CapSense® capacitive-sensing controllers and automotive TrueTouch® touchscreen solutions; a broad line of USB controllers, including solutions for the USB-C and USB Power Delivery standards; and analog PMIC Power Management ICs.
The portfolio includes specialized, high-performance parallel and serial NOR flash memories, static random access memories ("SRAM"), F-RAM™ ferroelectric memory devices, nonvolatile SRAMs ("nvSRAM"), and other specialty memories.
This division also includes our nonvolatile DIMM subsidiary AgigA Tech, Inc.
Refer to Part I, Item 1 (Business) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2018 for a discussion of our strategies.
Our total revenue decreased by $91.9 million, or 14.7%, to $532.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.
Revenue from the NAND flash business which was divested on April 1, 2019 was $49.5 million in the three months ended July 1, 2018.
Excluding the impact of the NAND flash business divestiture, our total revenues decreased by $42.4 million, or 7.4%, to $532.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.
The decrease was primarily due to demand softening across our NOR flash, microcontroller and wireless connectivity businesses.
Our total revenues decreased by $135.1 million, or 11.2%, to $1,071.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.
The decrease was attributable in part to the divestiture of our NAND flash business, which was completed on April 1, 2019.
Revenue from the NAND flash business decreased by $63.4 million to $31.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.
The remainder of the decrease was primarily due to demand softening across our NOR flash, microcontroller and wireless connectivity businesses.
Revenues recorded by MCD decreased by $14.3 million, or 3.9%, in the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period.
The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand for microcontroller and wireless connectivity products.
Revenues recorded by MCD decreased by $40.6 million, or 5.8%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period.
The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand for microcontroller and wireless connectivity products.
Revenues recorded by MPD decreased by $77.6 million, or 30.4%, in the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period.
Revenue from the divested NAND flash business was $49.5 million in the three months ended July 1, 2018.
Revenues recorded by MPD decreased by $94.5 million, or 18.9%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period.
The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand for NAND flash and NOR flash products, and the divestiture of our NAND flash business, which was completed on April 1, 2019.
Revenue from the NAND flash business decreased by $63.4 million to $31.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.
Our gross margin decreased to 37.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2019 from 37.5% in the three months ended July 1, 2018.
A primary driver was the decrease in revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period a year ago causing an increase in amortization expense from intangible assets as a percentage of revenue.
Amortization of intangible assets included in cost of revenue was $46.9 million or 8.8% of revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $48.1 million or 7.7% of revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
In addition, sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period a year ago.
Gross margins in the second quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018 benefited 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively, from the sale of previously reserved inventory.
Our gross margin improved to 37.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 from 37.0% in the six months ended July 1, 2018.
This improvement was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down for the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same prior year period.
Gross margins in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018 benefited 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively, from the sale of previously reserved inventory.
Included in cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $93.8 million and $96.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, respectively.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded a $29.5 million impairment charge for the equity-method investment in Deca Technologies, Inc. ("Deca").
The carrying value of our investment in Deca was $28.6 million and $65.1 million as of June 30, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively.
Deca will likely need to secure additional funding to support its growth and cash needs.
Our Revolving Credit Facility had a capacity of $540 million which was undrawn as of June 30, 2019.
On July 31, 2019, we amended our existing Revolving Credit Facility thereby increasing the available amount from $540 million to $700 million and extending its maturity from March 12, 2020 to January 31, 2021.
We may, at our sole discretion, extend the maturity for another six months to July 31, 2021.
We borrowed $447 million under the amended Revolving Credit Facility and repaid the entire outstanding Term Loan B principal balance of approximately $448 million as of July 31, 2019, resulting in extinguishment of Term Loan B, which was otherwise scheduled to mature on July 5, 2021.
•stock-based compensation expense of $50.9 million;
•impairment of investment in Deca of $29.5 million;
•accretion of interest expense on senior exchangeable notes and amortization of debt and financing costs on other debt of $9.4 million;
•restructuring costs and other adjustments of $4.0 million; and
•loss related to assets held for sale of $3.5 million.
•$53.8 million in operating lease right-of-use assets recorded upon adoption of ASC 842, partially offset by $50.2 million of operating lease liability;

•property and equipment expenditures of $18.0 million relating to purchases of certain manufacturing facility equipment; and
•proceeds of $2.9 million from the sale of inventories to SkyHigh.
•payments of $0.8 million on finance lease liabilities;
•partially offset by proceeds of $31.9 million from employee equity awards.
As of June 30, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance was $372.2 million as compared to $285.7 million as of December 30, 2018.
As of June 30, 2019, approximately 12.0% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
While these amounts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, a portion is denominated in foreign currencies.
All non-U.S. cash balances are exposed to local political, banking, currency control, and other risks.
As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under all of our debt facilities.
Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
