Refer to Part I Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2018 for a discussion of our strategies.
As we continue to implement our strategies, there are many internal and external factors that could impact our ability to meet any or all of our objectives.
Some of these factors are discussed in Part I Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2018 as well as in Part II Item 1A in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Our total revenues decreased by $43.2 million, or 7.4%, to $539.0 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.
Revenues recorded by MCD decreased by $26.3 million, or 7.8%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same prior year period.
The decrease was primarily due to the stage of a major end customer's product life-cycle in wireless connectivity and a decline in demand for memory products.
Revenues recorded by MPD decreased by $16.9 million, or 6.9%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same prior year period.
Our gross margin improved to 37.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from 36.5% in the three months ended April 1, 2018.
This improvement was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same prior year period.
The gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 was benefited by 0.7% and 1.6%, respectively, from the sale of previously reserved inventory.
Included in cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $46.9 million and $48.1 million for the first quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
By comparison, for the corresponding period of 2018 our share in the net loss of Deca was $3.5 million.
Deca continues to be in the process of developing and testing a fan-out wafer level packaging technology.
Deca’s estimated enterprise value is sensitive to its ability to achieve these product development and testing milestones.
We held 52.5% of Deca's outstanding voting shares as of March 31, 2019 and December 30, 2018.
