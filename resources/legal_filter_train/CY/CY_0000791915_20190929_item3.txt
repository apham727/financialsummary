Our investment portfolio consists of a variety of financial instruments that expose us to interest rate risk, including, but not limited to, money market funds, and certificates of deposit. Due to the relatively short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio.
Our debt obligations consist of a variety of financial instruments that expose us to interest rate risk, including, but not limited to our Revolving Credit Facility and exchangeable notes. Interest on the exchangeable notes is fixed and interest on our Revolving Credit Facility is tied to short-term interest rate benchmarks including the prime rate and the London inter-bank offered rate, or LIBOR.
A one hundred basis point change in the contractual interest rates would change our interest expense for the Revolving Credit Facility by approximately $1.0 million annually.
•sales of our products to Japanese distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros;
•some fixed asset purchases and sales are denominated in other foreign currencies.
To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within our operations, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, our operating margin could be unfavorably impacted by approximately 1%. We expect our hedges of foreign currency exposures to be highly effective and offset a significant portion of the short-term impact of changes in exchange rates on the hedged portion of our exposures. Please see Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the hedge contracts.
