Our investment portfolio consists of a variety of financial instruments that expose us to interest rate risk, including, but not limited to, money market funds, and certificates of deposit.
Due to the relatively short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio.
Our debt obligations consist of a variety of financial instruments that expose us to interest rate risk, including, but not limited to our Revolving Credit Facility and exchangeable notes.
A one hundred basis point change in the contractual interest rates would change our interest expense for the Revolving Credit Facility by approximately $1.0 million annually.
We are exposed to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the Japanese yen, the Euro and other foreign currencies.
•sales of our products to Japanese distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros;
•some fixed asset purchases and sales are denominated in other foreign currencies.
We use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our foreign exchange exposure on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
We also hedge a percentage of our forecasted revenue denominated in Japanese yen with foreign currency forward contracts.
The objective of these contracts is to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements to our operating results on a short-term basis.
We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes.
To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within our operations, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements.
Please see Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the hedge contracts.
