Refer to Part I Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a discussion of our strategies.
Our total revenues increased by $68.5 million, or 11.3%, to $673.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year.
The increase was primarily driven by strength in automotive and wireless connectivity, microcontrollers, and memory products.
Our total revenues increased by $149.1 million, or 8.6%, to $1,879.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year.
The increase was primarily driven by strength in memory products, microcontrollers, and wired and wireless connectivity products.
Revenues recorded by MCD increased by $39.8 million, or 10.7%, in the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same prior year period.
The increase was primarily driven by the growth in microcontroller, automotive and wireless connectivity products.
MCD revenue increased compared to the same three-month period of the prior year due to higher sales of PSoC, automotive and wireless products.
Revenues recorded by MCD increased by $66.6 million, or 6.3%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same prior year period.
The increase was primarily driven by growth in microcontroller, wireless connectivity and wired products.
The increase was primarily due to growth in revenue from Flash memory products.
The increase was primarily due to growth in revenue from the Flash memory products.
MPD revenue increased compared to the same nine-month period of the prior year primarily due to shift in product sales mix towards high density NOR product as well as increases in average selling price ("ASP") of NAND products.
Our gross margin improved to 38.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2018 from 34.7% in the three months ended October 1, 2017.
This favorability was partially offset by an increase in write-downs of carrying value of inventory for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period.
Write-down of inventories unfavorably impacted our gross margin by 1.3% and 1.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively.
Sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down aggregated to $5.2 million and $9.9 million for the third quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, which favorably impacted our gross margin by 0.8% and 1.6%, respectively.
During the first quarter of 2018, we initiated a restructuring plan (The "2018 Plan") which will contribute towards increasing longer term operational efficiency.
During the third quarter of 2018, the plan was expanded to add a reduction of another approximately 50 positions, which has contributed to lower unit costs in the third quarter of 2018.
Included in cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $50.2 million and $43.3 million for the third quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our gross margin improved to 37.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from 32.3% in the nine months ended October 1, 2017.
Additionally, there was a reduction in write-downs of carrying value of inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period.
Write-down of inventories unfavorably impacted our gross margin by 1.0% and 1.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively.
Sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down aggregated to $17.5 million and $27.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively, which favorably impacted our gross margin by 0.9% and 1.6%, respectively.
Included in the cost of revenues are restructuring costs of $3.1 million and $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively.
The increase in restructuring costs is primarily due to the 2018 Plan, which we began implementing in the first quarter of 2018 and which is favorably impacting costs starting in the second half of 2018.
Included in cost of revenues is the amortization of intangible assets of $146.4 million and $130.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively.
These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in labor expenses.
Our income tax expense was $5.6 million and $4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively.
Our income tax expense was $15.8 million and $13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively.
Our two equity investees are Deca Technologies Inc. ("Deca") and Enovix Corporation ("Enovix").
The carrying value of our investment in Enovix has been zero since December 31, 2017.
As of September 30, 2018 the carrying value of our investment in Deca was $111.6 million, which approximates its fair value.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018, our share in Deca's net loss was $3.7 million.
By comparison, for the corresponding period of 2017 our share in the combined net loss of Deca and Enovix was $4.9 million.
Deca continues to be in the process of developing and testing a fan-out wafer level packaging technology.
Deca’s estimated enterprise value is sensitive to its ability to achieve these product development and testing milestones.
We held 52.5% of Deca's outstanding voting shares as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
Our Revolving Credit Facility has a capacity of $540 million which was undrawn as of September 30, 2018.

•an increase in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities of $4.8 million mainly due to timing of payments to vendors;
•property and equipment expenditures of $58.1 million relating to purchases of certain manufacturing facility equipment; and
•a $20.0 million outlay related to the repurchase of stock; and
•a $10.0 million outlay related to partial extinguishment of the 2% 2020 Spansion Exchangeable Notes;
In December 2017, we entered into fixed-for-floating interest rate forward swap agreements with two counterparties, to swap variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments; these agreements will expire in July 2021.
The objective of the swap was to effectively fix the interest rate at current levels without having to refinance the outstanding term loan, thereby avoiding the incurrence of transaction costs.
The interest rate on the variable debt was fixed in December 2017 and became effective in April 2018; if interest rates at the time of the scheduled periodic payments are below this fixed rate, we will pay the difference between the fixed and actual rates.
Our long-term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest-bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities, payments of regularly scheduled cash dividends, repayment of debt, and share repurchases.
As of September 30, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance was $204.7 million as compared to $151.6 million as of December 31, 2017.
While these amounts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, a portion is denominated in foreign currencies.
As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under all of our debt facilities.
Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
As discussed in Note 1, we adopted Topic 606 on January 1, 2018.
The table below summarizes information with respect to repurchases of common stock made in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 under the $450 million stock buyback program, which was announced on October 20, 2015.
