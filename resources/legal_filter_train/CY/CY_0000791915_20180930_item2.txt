Refer to Part I Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a discussion of our strategies.
Our total revenues increased by $68.5 million, or 11.3%, to $673.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by strength in automotive and wireless connectivity, microcontrollers, and memory products.
Our total revenues increased by $149.1 million, or 8.6%, to $1,879.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by strength in memory products, microcontrollers, and wired and wireless connectivity products.
Revenues recorded by MCD increased by $66.6 million, or 6.3%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by growth in microcontroller, wireless connectivity and wired products. MCD revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 benefited from increase in volume of product sales as a result of new program ramps at certain customers.
Revenues recorded by MPD increased by $28.6 million, or 12.4%, in the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to growth in revenue from Flash memory products. MPD revenue increased compared to the same three-month period of the prior year primarily due to shift in product sales mix towards high density NOR products, as well as increases in average selling price ("ASP") of NAND products. 
Revenues recorded by MPD increased by $82.5 million, or 12.2%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to growth in revenue from the Flash memory products. MPD revenue increased compared to the same nine-month period of the prior year primarily due to shift in product sales mix towards high density NOR product as well as increases in average selling price ("ASP") of NAND products. 
Our gross margin improved to 38.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2018 from 34.7% in the three months ended October 1, 2017. The primary drivers of the improvement in gross margin were a shift in the product mix towards higher density memory products and decrease in commoditized products, higher fab utilization, which increased from 78.3% in the three months ended October 1, 2017 to 82.9% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and a reduction in the cost of certain products. This favorability was partially offset by an increase in write-downs of carrying value of inventory for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period. Write-down of inventories during the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $9.0 million as compared to $6.6 million in the three months ended October 1, 2017. 
Write-down of inventories unfavorably impacted our gross margin by 1.3% and 1.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively. Sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down aggregated to $5.2 million and $9.9 million for the third quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, which favorably impacted our gross margin by 0.8% and 1.6%, respectively. During the first quarter of 2018, we initiated a restructuring plan (The "2018 Plan") which will contribute towards increasing longer term operational efficiency. The 2018 Plan initially estimated a reduction of approximately 75 positions. During the third quarter of 2018, the plan was expanded to add a reduction of another approximately 50 positions, which has contributed to lower unit costs in the third quarter of 2018. Included in cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $50.2 million and $43.3 million for the third quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our gross margin improved to 37.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from 32.3% in the nine months ended October 1, 2017. The primary drivers of the improvement in gross margin were a shift in the product mix towards higher density memory products and decrease in commoditized products, higher fab utilization, which increased from 72.0% in the nine months ended October 1, 2017 to 80.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and a reduction in the cost of certain products. Additionally, there was a reduction in write-downs of carrying value of inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period. Write-down of inventories during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $18.4 million as compared to $26.1 million in the nine months ended October 1, 2017. Write-down of inventories unfavorably impacted our gross margin by 1.0% and 1.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively. Sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down aggregated to $17.5 million and $27.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively, which favorably impacted our gross margin by 0.9% and 1.6%, respectively. Included in the cost of revenues are restructuring costs of $3.1 million and $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively. The increase in restructuring costs is primarily due to the 2018 Plan, which we began implementing in the first quarter of 2018 and which is favorably impacting costs starting in the second half of 2018. Included in cost of revenues is the amortization of intangible assets of $146.4 million and $130.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively.
Our income tax expense was $5.6 million and $4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively. Our income tax expense was $15.8 million and $13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively. The income tax expense for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017 was primarily attributable to non-U.S. taxes associated with our non-U.S. operations.
Our two equity investees are Deca Technologies Inc. ("Deca") and Enovix Corporation ("Enovix"). The carrying value of our investment in Enovix has been zero since December 31, 2017. As of September 30, 2018 the carrying value of our investment in Deca was $111.6 million, which approximates its fair value.
Our Revolving Credit Facility has a capacity of $540 million which was undrawn as of September 30, 2018.
•stock-based compensation expense of $76.6 million;
•accretion of interest expense on Senior Exchangeable Notes and amortization of debt and financing costs on other debt of $20.0 million; 
•loss on disposal and impairment of property and equipment of $7.2 million;
•our share in the net loss of an equity method investee of $10.9 million; and
•restructuring costs and other adjustments of $14.2 million.
•an increase in other current and long-term assets of $30.1 million for prepayments for licenses and other vendors;
•an increase in inventories of $17.6 million to support a higher revenue run rate; and 
•property and equipment expenditures of $58.1 million relating to purchases of certain manufacturing facility equipment; and
•a $20.0 million outlay related to the repurchase of stock; and
Our long-term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest-bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities, payments of regularly scheduled cash dividends, repayment of debt, and share repurchases. As of September 30, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance was $204.7 million as compared to $151.6 million as of December 31, 2017. As of September 30, 2018, approximately 32.6% of our cash was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. While these amounts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, a portion is denominated in foreign currencies. All non-U.S. cash balances are exposed to local political, banking, currency control, and other risks. In addition, these amounts, if repatriated, may be subject to tax and other transfer restrictions. 
As discussed in Note 1, we adopted Topic 606 on January 1, 2018. There have been no other changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The table below summarizes information with respect to repurchases of common stock made in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 under the $450 million stock buyback program, which was announced on October 20, 2015.
