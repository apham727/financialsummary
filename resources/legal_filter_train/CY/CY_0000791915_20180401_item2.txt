Refer to Part I Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a discussion of our strategies.
As we continue to implement our strategies, there are many internal and external factors that could impact our ability to meet any or all of our objectives.
Some of these factors are discussed under Part I Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as in Part II Item 1A in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Our total revenues increased by $50.4 million, or 9.5%, to $582.2 million for the three-month period ended April 1, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year.
The increase was primarily driven by strength in the memory products.
Revenues recorded by MPD increased by $31.6 million, or 14.7%, in the three months ended April 1, 2018 compared to the same prior year period.
The increase was primarily due to $28.5 million of revenue growth from the Flash memory products.
The overall ASP of our products for MPD for the three months ended April 1, 2018 was $1.64, which increased by $0.38, compared with the same prior year period.
The increase is primarily attributed to higher ASPs for Flash memory products and changes in product mix.
Our gross margin improved to 36.5% in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from 29.5% in the three months ended April 2, 2017.
One of the primary drivers of the improvement in gross margin was higher fab utilization which increased from 63% in the three months ended April 2, 2017 to 74% in the three months ended April 1, 2018 and a reduction in the cost of certain products.
Additionally, there was a reduction in write-downs of carrying value of inventory during the three months ended April 1, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period.
Write-down of inventories unfavorably impacted our gross margin by 1.2% and 2.0% for the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, respectively.
Sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down aggregated to $9.0 million and $7.6 million for the first quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, which favorably impacted our gross margin by 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively.
Included in the cost of revenues are restructuring charges of $1.9 million and $0.2 million for the first quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively.
During first quarter of 2018, we initiated the 2018 Plan restructuring plan which will contribute towards increasing longer term operational efficiency.
The 2018 plan will result in a reduction of approximately 75 positions, which is expected to favorably impact costs starting second half of 2018.
Included in the cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $48.1 million and $43.2 million for the first quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively.
Our income tax expense was $5.1 million and $4.9 million for the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, respectively.
•stock-based compensation expense of $18.5 million,
•restructuring costs of $4.1 million,
•accretion of interest expense on Senior Exchangeable Notes and amortization of debt and financing costs on other debt of $8.4 million,
•loss on disposal and impairment of property and equipment of $5.3 million and
•our share in the net loss of equity method investees of $3.5 million.
•a decrease in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities of $21.7 million mainly due to timing of payments and payments related to restructuring activities,
•an increase in inventories of $4.2 million to support expected demand of MCD products for the upcoming quarters of 2018,
•property and equipment expenditures of $17.3 million relating to purchases of certain manufacturing facility equipment.
•a $10.0 million payment for extinguishment of 2% 2020 Spansion Exchangeable Notes,
Our long-term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest-bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities, payments of regularly scheduled cash dividends, and the repayment of debt.
As of April 1, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance was $106.8 million as compared to $151.6 million as of December 31, 2017.
As of April 1, 2018 approximately 41.6% of our cash was owned by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
