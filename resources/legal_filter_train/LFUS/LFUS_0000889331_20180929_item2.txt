For the third quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $439.2 million compared to $317.9 million in the third quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $121.3 million, or 38.2%.
The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS, which added $99.7 million in sales.
Additionally, net sales increased in the Electronics segment driven by higher volumes due to strong demand across various end markets and geographies within the segment.The Company recognized net income of $53.5 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $42.8 million, or $1.87 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.
The increase in net income reflects operating income increases across the Electronics segment, partially offset by lower operating income in the Automotive segment.
Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 2.1 million resulting from the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $252.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2018 as compared to $181.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
