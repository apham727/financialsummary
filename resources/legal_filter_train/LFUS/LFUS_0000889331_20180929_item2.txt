Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).
For the third quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $439.2 million compared to $317.9 million in the third quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $121.3 million, or 38.2%. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS, which added $99.7 million in sales. Additionally, net sales increased in the Electronics segment driven by higher volumes due to strong demand across various end markets and geographies within the segment.The Company recognized net income of $53.5 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $42.8 million, or $1.87 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in net income reflects operating income increases across the Electronics segment, partially offset by lower operating income in the Automotive segment. Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 2.1 million resulting from the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $252.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2018 as compared to $181.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management, which more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash tax payments.
On July 6, 2018, the Trump administration imposed Section 301 tariffs on certain products (known as List1) that are imported into the United States where the country of origin is China. Additionally, on August 23, 2018, List 2 was put into effect which imposed an additional 25% tariff to products on the list items. These tariffs primarily impact the Electronics segment and to a lesser extent our Automotive segment. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on our future results of operations.
In September 2018, the European Union began applying the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) to all new car registrations, which defines a global standard for acceptable European Union wide emissions. As a result of this incoming standard, there has been a slow down in the European passenger car market as manufacturers need to validate and test new cars under the new regulatory standards.
The following table summarizes the Company’s condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented. The third quarter of 2018 includes $11.2 million ($79.4 million year-to-date) of non-segment charges primarily related to the IXYS acquisition, which includes $36.9 million year-to-date of purchase accounting inventory step-up charges previously recorded during the first and second quarters of 2018, $2.5 million ($16.3 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs related to legal, accounting and other expenses $3.1 million ($8.7 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, $4.6 million ($9.4 million year-to-date) of severance and other restructuring charges, $4.5 million year-to-date stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior services periods. In addition, for the three months ended September 29, 2018, there were charges of $1.0 million ($3.6 million year-to-date) of severance, other restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges, of which $1.1 million of charges associated with the exit of the Custom business in the second quarter.
The third quarter of 2017 includes approximately $6.3 million of non-segment charges ($8.2 million year-to-date). These charges were primarily attributable to acquisition-related and integration costs related to legal, accounting and other expenses associated with completed or contemplated acquisitions of approximately $4.8 million ($6.6 million year-to-date), including $1.6 million ($1.6 million year-to-date) of purchase accounting inventory charges related to the Company’s 2017 acquisition of U.S. Sensor and $1.5 million ($1.5 million year-to-date) of charges related to restructuring and production transfers in our Asia operations.
Net sales increased $121.3 million or 38.2%, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 with increases of $99.7 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS acquisition partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher volume primarily in the Electronics businesses and higher volume in the Industrial segment.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2018 increased $399.5 million, or 43.6%, compared to the first nine months of 2017 with increases of $286.2 million and $6.5 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively and $20.0 million of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher volume across all three segments.
Total operating expenses were $103.4 million, or 23.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $75.0 million, or 23.6% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in operating expenses of $28.3 million is primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the IXYS acquisition and an increase of $6.8 million in amortization expense resulting from the acquisition of IXYS.
Total operating expense for the first nine months of 2018 was $324.8 million, or 24.7% of net sales, compared to $212.2 million, or 23.1% of net sales, for the first nine months of 2017. The increase in operating expenses of $112.6 million is primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, an increase in amortization expense of $20.1 million resulting from the acquisition of IXYS as well as higher acquisition-related and integration costs of $11.9 million. Total operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 23.1% for the first nine months of 2017 to 24.7% for the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to the higher amortization expense and acquisition-related and integration charges noted above.
Operating income was $76.2 million, an increase of $17.6 million, or 30.1%, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $58.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in operating income is due to the acquisition of IXYS and higher volume due to the strong demand across various end markets and geographies within our Electronics segment that was partially offset by lower operating income in the Automotive segment. Operating margins decreased from 18.4% in the third quarter of 2017 to 17.4% in the third quarter of 2018 driven by higher amortization expense, restructuring and integration charges. 
Operating income for the first nine months of 2018 was $173.4 million compared to $167.7 million for the first nine months of 2017. The increase in operating income is primarily due to the acquisition of IXYS and higher volume in the electronics and industrial businesses partially offset by $36.9 million of purchase accounting inventory charges, higher acquisition and integration charges and amortization expense. Operating margins decreased from 18.3% to 13.2% in 2018 driven by the purchase accounting inventory charges, higher amortization expense and acquisition and integration charges that negatively impacted margins by 2.8%, 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively.
Income before income taxes was $68.2 million, or 15.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $55.5 million, or 17.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2017. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before taxes was impacted by increased interest expense of $2.3 million associated with increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition and other expense of $1.3 million as a result of unrealized investment losses associated with our equity investments during the three months ended September 29, 2018 as compared to other income of $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017 
Income before income taxes for the first nine months of 2018 was $165.2 million, or 12.5% of net sales compared to $160.3 million, or 17.5% of net sales, for the first nine months of 2017. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above income before income taxes was favorably impacted by increases in foreign exchange gains of $4.9 million and increases in other income of $1.4 million primarily due to unrealized investment gains in our equity investments partially offset by higher interest expense of $7.1 million mainly resulting from increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
The Industrial segment net sales increased slightly by $0.1 million, or 0.4%, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher volume across the power fuse and relay businesses despite the full exit of the Custom business during the second quarter of 2018.
The Industrial segment net sales increased $8.7 million, or 10.9% in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 due to higher volumes primarily in the power fuse and relay operations.
Net sales in the Americas increased $41.4 million, or 35.8%, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 driven by incremental net sales related to the IXYS acquisitions of $25.0 million, continued strong volumes in the passives, electronic sensors, auto sensors, commercial vehicles, and relays partially offset by lower volumes in passenger car and exit from the Custom business.
Net sales in the Americas increased $113.6 million, or 34.6%, in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 driven by incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions of $68.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively, increased volume in the Electronics, Automotive and Industrial segments and favorable foreign currency effects of $0.6 million. 
European net sales increased $115.4 million, or 63.2%, in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 . The increase in net sales was primarily due to incremental net sales related to the IXYS acquisition of $86.7 million with strong growth especially in the passive and sensor businesses in the Electronics segment and continued growth in commercial vehicle, automotive sensor businesses as well as favorable foreign currency effects of $14.4 million partially offset by lower volumes in the passenger car business.
Asia-Pacific net sales increased $170.5 million, or 42.0%, in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.

During July 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.37 to $0.43. This equates to an annualized dividend of $1.72 per share.
Operating cash inflows are largely attributable to sales of the Company’s products. Operating cash outflows are largely attributable to recurring expenditures for raw materials, labor, rent, interest, taxes and other operating activities.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $252.1 million for the  first nine months of 2018, compared to $181.3 million during the nine months September 30, 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash taxes. 
The Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock under a program for the period May 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019 (“Share Repurchase Program”). The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the third quarter of 2018. 
As of October 29, 2018, the Company has repurchased 200,000 shares of its common stock totaling $35.9 million since the quarter ended September 29, 2018.
As of September 29, 2018, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules. Specifically, the Company was not liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties, the Company was not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity and the Company did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets. The Company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases" (Topic 842). This ASU requires lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases of greater than twelve months. The accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition. The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The Company has made progress on assessing the Company’s portfolio of leases and compiling a central repository of all active leases. We are in the process of assessing the design of the future lease process and drafting a policy to address the new standard requirements. Key lease data elements are being evaluated including developing a methodology for determining the incremental borrowing rate across all countries where we have operations. While the Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company expects to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for its operating leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14 "Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which amends ASC 715-20, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General. The amended guidance modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plans by removing and adding certain disclosures for these plans. The eliminated disclosures include (a) the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI") expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit costs over the next fiscal year, and (b) the effects of a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the net periodic benefit costs and the benefit obligation for post-retirement health care benefits. Additional disclosures include descriptions of significant gains and losses affecting the benefit obligation for the period. The adoption of this guidance will modify our disclosures but will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
