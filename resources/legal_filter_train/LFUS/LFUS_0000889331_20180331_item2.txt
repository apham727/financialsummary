Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a global leader in circuit protection products with advancing platforms in power control and sensor technologies, serving customers in the electronics, automotive, and industrial markets.
For the first quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $417.8 million compared to $285.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $132.4 million, or 46.4%.
The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS along with higher volume across all three segments.
Net sales for the Automotive segment increased $18.3 million, or 17.0% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units and geographic regions.
Net sales in the Industrial segment increased $3.4 million or 14.4% due to volume growth in the power fuse and relay businesses.
The Company recognized net income of $36.0 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $38.9 million, or $1.69 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.
Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 1.5 million as a result of the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $69.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $22.9 million for the three months ended April 1, 2017.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs.
On January 17, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of IXYS for total purchase consideration of $778.8 million, net of cash acquired.
IXYS has a broad customer base, serving more than 3,500 customers through its direct salesforce and global distribution partners.
The following table summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.
The first quarter of 2018 includes $39.5 million of non-segment charges.
In addition, there were $0.8 million of restructuring charges related to certain operations in the Electronics segment.
The first quarter of 2017 includes approximately $1.5 million of non-segment charges.
Net sales increased $132.4 million, or 46.4%, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 with increases of $86.3 million and $3.1 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S Sensor acquisitions, respectively.
The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher volume across all businesses in the Electronics segment and Automotive segments as well as increases in the fuse and relay businesses in the Industrial segment.
Gross profit was $149.6 million, or 35.8% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $113.7 million, or 39.8% of net sales in the first quarter of 2017.
Total operating expenses were $112.1 million, or 26.8% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $64.8 million, or 22.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017.
Operating income was $37.6 million, a decrease of $11.3 million or 23.1% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $48.9 million for the first quarter of 2017.
The decrease in operating income is primarily due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $17.9 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the IXYS acquisition as described above.
Operating margins decreased from 17.1% in the first quarter of 2017 to 9.0% in the first quarter of 2018.
Income before income taxes was $44.6 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $47.4 million, or 16.6% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income, income before income taxes was impacted by favorable comparative foreign exchange gains that were partially offset by increased interest expense associated with the increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
Interest expense increased $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily reflecting increased borrowings.
Income tax expense was $8.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 19.3%, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $8.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 18.0%, for the first quarter of 2017.
European net sales increased $40.9 million, or 69.4%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.
