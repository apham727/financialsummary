Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).
For the third quarter of 2019, the Company recognized net sales of $362.0 million compared to $439.2 million in the third quarter of 2018 representing a decrease of $77.2 million, or 17.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in the Electronics and Automotive segments and $4.4 million or 1.0% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher volume in the Industrial segment. The Company recognized net income of $35.6 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $53.5 million, or $2.10 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018. The decrease in net income reflects lower operating income in the Electronics segment and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by lower non-segment charges compared to prior year primarily due to the IXYS acquisition.
The Company continues to take actions to improve its cost structure and drive the synergies from the integration of IXYS. The Company expects to realize cost savings from the restructuring activities taken during 2019 including the reorganization of certain manufacturing, selling and administrative functions across all segments and the closure of a European manufacturing facility in the automotive sensors business within the Automotive segment. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $160.9 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 as compared to $252.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2018. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected lower earnings and higher working capital levels primarily due to the timing of supplier payments.
During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019, the Company repurchased 311,786 and 579,916 shares of its common stock totaling $49.5 million and $95.0 million, respectively. Since September 30, 2018, the Company has repurchased 971,888 shares of its common stock at an average price of $167.65 totaling $162.9 million.
The following table summarizes the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented. The third quarter of 2019 includes $5.7 million ($17.9 million year-to-date) of non-segment charges, of which $2.5 million ($11.0 million year-to-date) of restructuring charges are primarily related to employee termination costs and other restructuring charges and $3.2 million ($6.9 million year-to-date) of acquisition-related and integration charges are primarily related to the IXYS acquisition and other contemplated acquisitions.
The third quarter of 2018 includes approximately $10.1 million ($75.6 million year-to-date) of charges related to the IXYS acquisition, which include $36.9 million year-to-date of purchase accounting inventory step-up charges previously recorded during the first and second quarters of 2018, $2.4 million ($16.1 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses, $3.1 million ($8.7 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, $4.6 million ($7.3 million year-to-date) of employee termination costs and other restructuring charges, and $4.5 million year-to-date stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior service periods and $2.1 million year-to-date change in control expense related to IXYS. In addition, there were $0.4 million ($1.6 million year-to-date) of employee termination costs, other restructuring, impairment charges of $1.1 million associated with the exit of the Custom business in the second quarter, and $0.7 million ($1.1 million year-to-date) of acquisition-related expenses for other contemplated acquisitions.
Net sales decreased $150.8 million or 11.5% for the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to lower volume across the Electronics and Automotive segments and $22.3 million or 1.7% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates.
Gross profit was $428.0 million, or 36.7% of net sales, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $498.2 million, or 37.9% of net sales, in the first nine months of 2018. The decrease in gross profit reflected lower volume across all segments. In 2018 the IXYS purchase accounting inventory step-up charge of $36.9 million negatively impacted the 2018 gross margin by 2.8%.
Operating income was $160.5 million, a decrease of $12.9 million, or 7.5%, for the first nine months of 2019 compared to $173.4 million for the first nine months of 2018. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to lower gross profit across all segments, 
partially offset by lower operating expenses noted above and the $36.9 million purchase accounting inventory step-up charges in 2018. Operating margins increased from 13.2% in the first nine months of 2018 to 13.8% in the first nine months of 2019 driven by lower operating expenses discussed above.
Income before income taxes was $41.4 million, or 11.4% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2019 compared to $68.2 million, or 15.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2018. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before taxes was primarily impacted by increased foreign exchange losses of $4.0 million during the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018, unrealized investment gains of $2.0 million associated with our equity investments during the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to unrealized losses of $2.6 million during the three months ended September 29, 2018, and increased interest income of $1.0 million during  three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018.
Income before income taxes was $141.4 million, or 12.1% of net sales, for the first nine months of 2019 compared to $165.2 million, or 12.5% of net sales, for the first nine months of 2018. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before taxes was impacted by foreign exchange losses of $5.6 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2019 compared to foreign exchange gains of $6.4 million during the nine months ended September 29, 2018, and increases of $1.0 million in other income primarily due to unrealized investment gains associated with our equity investments and interest income, partially offset by impairment charges of $3.1 million for certain other investments and a $2.6 million loss on the disposal of a business within the Electronics segment during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
Income tax expense was $25.0 million, or an effective tax rate of 17.7%, for the first nine months of 2019 compared to income tax expense of $33.3 million, or an effective tax rate of 20.1%, for the first nine months of 2018. The effective tax rate for the 2019 period is lower than the effective tax rate for the 2018 period primarily due to lower taxes in certain non-US jurisdictions, including the impact of a tax holiday in China which was applicable in the 2019 period but not the 2018 period. The effective tax rate for the 2019 period was lower than the applicable U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions.
Net sales decreased $9.7 million, or 8.5%, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 due to decreased volume primarily in the passenger car and automotive sensor businesses from a decline in global auto production and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $1.9 million.

Net sales decreased slightly by $1.9 million, or 2.1%, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to the exit of the Custom business during the second quarter of 2018 and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $0.6 million, partially offset by higher volume in the power fuse and relay businesses.
Net sales decreased $34.1 million, or 21.7%, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to lower volume across all businesses within the Electronics segment, lower volume in automotive sensor and commercial vehicle businesses in the Automotive segment, and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $0.1 million. 
Net sales decreased $45.5 million, or 10.3%, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to lower volume in electronics products and semiconductor businesses within the Electronics segment, lower volume in automotive sensor and commercial vehicle businesses in the Automotive segment, the exit of the Custom business within Industrial segment during the second quarter of 2018 and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $0.7 million.
Net sales decreased $8.7 million, or 9.7%, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower volume in semiconductor business within the Electronics segment, lower volume in passenger car products and commercial vehicle businesses within the Automotive segment and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $3.2 million, partially offset by higher volume in electronics products within the Electronics segment and higher volume across all businesses within Industrial segments.
Net sales decreased $33.7 million, or 11.3%, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018.
