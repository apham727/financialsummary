Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a global leader in circuit protection products with advancing platforms in power control and sensor technologies, serving customers in the electronics, automotive, and industrial markets.
For the second quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $459.2 million compared to $313.4 million in the second quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $145.8 million, or 46.5%.
The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS, which added $100.2 million in sales along with higher volume across all three segments.
Net sales for Electronics increased $130.0 million, or 76.7%, primarily due to the acquisition of IXYS and strong growth across all the business units and favorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $8.0 million.
Net sales for the Automotive segment increased $10.7 million, or 9.2% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units.
Net sales in the Industrial segment increased $5.1 million or 18.7% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units.
The Company recognized net income of $42.3 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $48.6 million, or $2.11 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017.
Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 2.1 million resulting from the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $140.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $93.6 million for the six months ended July 1, 2017.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash taxes.
During the second quarter of 2018, the Company announced as part of its strategic assessment and cost savings initiatives, the exit of the Custom business within the Industrial segment and the Radio Pulse business within the IXYS acquisition.
The exit of the Custom business resulted in total impairment charges of $1.1 million for the tradename and real property.
The exit of the Radio Pulse business resulted in restructuring charges of $2.1 million, of which $1.4 million was for severance charges and $0.7 million of other restructuring charges.
The following table summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.
The second quarter of 2018 includes $28.7 million of non-segment charges.
The charges related to the IXYS acquisition total $24.4 million ($63.2 million year-to-date) and include $19.0 million ($36.9 million year-to-date) of purchase accounting inventory charges, $2.3 million ($14.1 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses associated with the acquisition of IXYS, $3.1 million ($5.6 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior services periods of $4.5 million year-to-date and other charges of $2.1 million year-to-date.
In addition, there were $3.2 million ($3.9 million year-to-date) of severance and other restructuring charges and $1.1 million of impairment charges ($1.1 million year-to-date) associated with the exit of the Radio Pulse and Custom businesses, respectively.
The second quarter of 2017 includes approximately $0.3 million of non-segment charges ($1.8 million year-to-date).
These were primarily attributable to acquisition-related costs primarily related to legal and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisitions in 2016 of the ON Portfolio.
Net sales increased $145.8 million, or 46.5%, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 with increases of $100.2 million and $3.4 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively.
Net sales for the first six months of 2018 increased $278.2 million, or 46.5%, compared to the first six months of 2017 with increases of $186.5 million and $6.5 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively.

The increase in gross profit reflects the IXYS acquisition and volume growth across all segments and expense leverage across all segments.
Total operating expenses were $109.4 million, or 23.8% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $72.3 million, or 23.1% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017.

Total operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 22.9% for the first six months of 2017 to 25.2% for the first six months of 2018 primarily due to the higher amortization expense and acquisition-related and integration charges noted above.
Operating income was $59.6 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 1.1%, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $60.3 million for the second quarter of 2017.
Increases in operating income across the Electronics segment were more than offset by purchase accounting inventory charges of $19.0 million, higher amortization charges of $7.2 million and higher restructuring and impairment charges of $4.3 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the IXYS acquisition as described above.
Operating margins decreased from 19.2% in the second quarter of 2017 to 13.0% in the second quarter of 2018.
Operating income for the first six months of 2018 was $97.2 million, or 11.1% of net sales, compared to $109.1 million, or 18.2% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017.

Income before income taxes was $52.3 million, or 11.4% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $57.4 million, or 18.3% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before income taxes was impacted by increased unfavorable foreign exchange losses of $3.8 million primarily due to fluctuations in the Euro and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and increased interest expense of $2.5 million associated with the increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
Additionally, partially offsetting the previously mentioned expense increases was an increase in other income of $1.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended July 1, 2017 primarily as a result of unrealized investment gains associated with our equity investments.
Income before income taxes for the first six months of 2018 was $97.0 million, or 11.1% of net sales compared to $104.8 million, or 17.5% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017.

The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the acquisition of IXYS.

The Automotive segment net sales increased $29.0 million, or 12.9%, in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 due to increased volume across all businesses with the commercial vehicle and sensor businesses having the most growth as well as favorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $11.9 million.
