Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018.
We recorded a $4.2 million adjustment to increase retained earnings to reflect the cumulative impact of adopting this standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2019, primarily related to certain long-term contracts our Filtration and Technical Packaging segments have that converted to the cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition.
A reconciliation of the financial statement line items impacted for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 under ASC 606 to the prior accounting standards is provided in Note 14.
Revenue is recognized when control of the goods or services promised under the contract is transferred to the customer either at a point in time (e.g., upon delivery) or over time (e.g., as we perform under the contract).
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the expected consideration, or the transaction price, is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation.
Revenue is then recognized for the transaction price allocated to the performance obligation when control of the promised goods or services underlying the performance obligation is transferred.
Approximately 52% of the segment’s revenues (approximately 19% of consolidated revenues) are accounted for over time as the product does not have an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for costs incurred plus a reasonable margin or the inventory is owned by the customer.
Most of our contract modifications are for products that are not distinct from the existing contract and are accounted for as part of that existing contract.In the third quarter of 2019, sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $199.8 million, $20.1 million and $0.77 per share, respectively, compared to $192.2 million, $19.0 million and $0.73 per share, respectively, in the third quarter of 2018.
