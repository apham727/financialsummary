Under our Framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.
Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.
Net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2,747 million and $5,247 million, compared to $2,497 million and $4,872 million, respectively, in the same periods in 2017, driven by an increase in net sales in all segments.
The increase in both periods was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $141 million and $209 million, respectively, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North American and Europe, and an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in data centers.
Life Sciences sales increased by $24 million and $46 million, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product lines.
Net sales in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments increased by $3 million and $6 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.36 per share, or 86%, when compared to the second quarter of 2017, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 24.6 million shares of common stock for approximately $674 million.
·    A decrease of $47 million in equity earnings, driven largely by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of long-term sales agreements with a customer of HSG.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.
We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that segment net sales will reach approximately $11.3 billion, an increase from prior expectations of $11.0 billion.
We anticipate Corning’s LCD glass volume will grow faster than the expected LCD glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase in the high-teen percentage range with organic growth improving by a low-teen percentage range with an additional $200 million from the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers.
Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $50 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, when compared to the prior year.
·    An increase of $46 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales in North America, Europe and China.
Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $137 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, when compared to the prior year.
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, gross margin increased by $85 million, or 9%, and $89 million, or 5%, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in sales.See our 2017 Form 10-K, Part I, Item 3.
