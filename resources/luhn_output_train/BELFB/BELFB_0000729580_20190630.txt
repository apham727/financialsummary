The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these Forward-Looking Statements which may be necessary to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Bel Fuse Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2019, except as discussed in “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” below.
In connection with the adoption, we elected to utilize the Comparatives Under 840 Option whereby the Company will continue to present prior period financial statements and disclosures under ASC 840.
Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less) and an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets.
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets in the amount of $20.7 million and lease liabilities related to our operating leases in the amount of $21.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019.
The change in balance of our unbilled receivables from December 31, 2018 to June 30, 2019 primarily relates to a timing difference between the Company’s performance (i.e. when our product is shipped to a customer-controlled hub) and the point at which the Company can invoice the customer per the terms of the customer contract (i.e. when the customer pulls our product from the customer-controlled hub).
The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of June 30, 2019 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $14.3 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2020 - 2025.
It is expected that 21% of this aggregate amount will be recognized in 2020, 54% will be recognized in 2021 and the remainder will be recognized in years beyond 2021.·   Revenues – The Company’s revenues decreased by $6.2 million (or 2.4%) in the first half of 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018.
The backlog of orders for our Power Solutions and Protection products declined by 17% and backlog for our Magnetic Solutions products was down 29% from year-end 2018 levels.
Order volumes were lower in the first half of 2019 as a result of slowdowns in certain markets coupled with customers working down heighted inventory levels which had been built up in response to new product launches and the tariffs that went into effect in 2018 and 2019.
·   Pricing and Availability of Materials – While material cost and availability for certain components have started to ease, the higher raw material costs which were in place during 2018, particularly related to resistors, capacitors and mosfets, are still running through our supply chain as we ship the balance of our inventory on hand from 2018.
As a result, the Company’s material costs as a percentage of sales increased to 43.8% during the first half of 2019 from 41.4% during the first half of 2018.
·   Labor Costs – Labor costs decreased from 11.4% of sales during the first half of 2018 to 11.0% of sales during the first half of 2019, as a more favorable exchange rate environment in 2019 related to the Chinese Renminbi offset the overall impact of minimum wage increases in Mexico which went into effect on January 1, 2019 as well as minimum wage increases in the PRC which went into effect in the first and third quarters of 2018.
·   Impact of Foreign Currency – During the first six months of 2019, the Company experienced lower labor and overhead costs of $3.2 million related to favorable fluctuations in exchange rates versus 2018, partially offset by foreign exchange transactional losses realized of $0.1 million.
The Company was favorably impacted by transactional foreign exchange gains in the first half of 2019 due to the depreciation of the Euro, Pound, and Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as compared to exchange rates in effect during 2018.
