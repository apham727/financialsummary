The decrease in the deferred revenue balance during the six months ended August 3, 2019 is primarily due to approximately $412,000 of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2019, offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations.
These costs are deferred and amortized based on the forecasted number of units sold over the estimated benefit term, which was estimated to be approximately 10 years.
During the six month ended August 3, 2019, amortization of these incremental direct costs were $54,000 and the balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at August 3, 2019 was $848,000, of which $109,000 is reported in other current assets and $739,000 is reported in other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.
The remaining contract costs are expected to be amortized over the estimated remaining period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately 7 years.
