Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Xcerra, which is expected to be a complex, costly and time-consuming process.
In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated.
As a result, it cannot be assured that the Merger will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.
Although we have completed the Merger, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger, including restructuring expenses and the payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related financing transactions.
These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Furthermore, we expect to incur material restructuring and integration charges in connection with the Merger, which may adversely affect our operating results in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Cohu incurred $9.8 million and $0.4 million of acquisition-related costs, and $37.8 million and $9.1 million of restructuring charges, for the Xcerra acquisition during fiscal year 2018 and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively.The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the time they are made, and do not necessarily reflect managementâ€™s outlook at any other point in time.
The increase in our net sales was driven by the acquisition of Xcerra Corporation, completed on October 1, 2018, and our results in the first six months of 2019 included sales of $157.6 million contributed by this acquired business.
We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met.
Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.
