Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.
The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 4, 2017.
In May 2014, August 2015, April 2016, May 2016 and December 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASU 2015-14 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date, ASU 2016-10 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, and ASU 2016-20 (ASC Topic 606) Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, respectively.
ASC Topic 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
Based on its assessment, the Company plans to adopt the new revenue standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition.
The amendments in this ASU require entities to measure all investments in equity securities at fair value with changes recognized through net income.
This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting, to those that result in consolidation of the investee, or for which the entity meets a practicability exception to fair value measurement.
Additionally, the amendments eliminate certain disclosure requirements related to financial instruments measured at amortized cost and add disclosures related to the measurement categories of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The Company expects to elect the measurement alternative for measurement of equity investments, defined as cost, less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the Price Changes) until the equity investments fair value becomes readily determinable.
The amount of the impact to equity investments will depend on any Price Changes observed after adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.The following is a discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations for our fiscal quarters ended December 29, 2017, September 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016, referred to herein as the December 2017 quarter, the September 2017 quarter, and the December 2016 quarter, respectively.
