We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1997) and China (since 2005).
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of financial results for the full year.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense.The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Sales returns for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $0 and $2,000, respectively and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $4,000 and $5,000, respectively.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,207,000 and $4,597,000 at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,319,000 and $7,189,000, respectively.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our September 30, 2019, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 42% of current assets and 30% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the third quarter of 2019 totaled $1,658,000 versus $1,902,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $244,000 or 12.8% over the same period last year.
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2019 was $888,000 versus $846,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 53.6% in the third quarter of 2019 versus 44.5% in the comparable period for 2018.
Other income, net of other expense, in the third quarter of 2019 was $188,000 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
