For the third quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $439.2 million compared to $317.9 million in the third quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $121.3 million, or 38.2%.
Additionally, net sales increased in the Electronics segment driven by higher volumes due to strong demand across various end markets and geographies within the segment.The Company recognized net income of $53.5 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $42.8 million, or $1.87 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.
The increase in net income reflects operating income increases across the Electronics segment, partially offset by lower operating income in the Automotive segment.
Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 2.1 million resulting from the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $252.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2018 as compared to $181.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management, which more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash tax payments.
The third quarter of 2018 includes $11.2 million ($79.4 million year-to-date) of non-segment charges primarily related to the IXYS acquisition, which includes $36.9 million year-to-date of purchase accounting inventory step-up charges previously recorded during the first and second quarters of 2018, $2.5 million ($16.3 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs related to legal, accounting and other expenses $3.1 million ($8.7 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, $4.6 million ($9.4 million year-to-date) of severance and other restructuring charges, $4.5 million year-to-date stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior services periods.
In addition, for the three months ended September 29, 2018, there were charges of $1.0 million ($3.6 million year-to-date) of severance, other restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges, of which $1.1 million of charges associated with the exit of the Custom business in the second quarter.
These charges were primarily attributable to acquisition-related and integration costs related to legal, accounting and other expenses associated with completed or contemplated acquisitions of approximately $4.8 million ($6.6 million year-to-date), including $1.6 million ($1.6 million year-to-date) of purchase accounting inventory charges related to the Companyâ€™s 2017 acquisition of U.S. Sensor and $1.5 million ($1.5 million year-to-date) of charges related to restructuring and production transfers in our Asia operations.
Net sales increased $121.3 million or 38.2%, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 with increases of $99.7 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS acquisition partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates.
The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher volume primarily in the Electronics businesses and higher volume in the Industrial segment.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2018 increased $399.5 million, or 43.6%, compared to the first nine months of 2017 with increases of $286.2 million and $6.5 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively and $20.0 million of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates.
Gross profit was $179.6 million, or 40.9% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018, compared to $133.7 million, or 42.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2017.
Gross profit was $498.2 million, or 37.9% of net sales, in the first nine months of 2018, compared to $379.9 million, or 41.4% of net sales in the first nine months of 2017.
Total operating expenses were $103.4 million, or 23.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $75.0 million, or 23.6% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2017.
Total operating expense for the first nine months of 2018 was $324.8 million, or 24.7% of net sales, compared to $212.2 million, or 23.1% of net sales, for the first nine months of 2017.
Total operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 23.1% for the first nine months of 2017 to 24.7% for the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to the higher amortization expense and acquisition-related and integration charges noted above.
Operating income was $76.2 million, an increase of $17.6 million, or 30.1%, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $58.6 million for the third quarter of 2017.
Operating margins decreased from 18.4% in the third quarter of 2017 to 17.4% in the third quarter of 2018 driven by higher amortization expense, restructuring and integration charges.
Operating income for the first nine months of 2018 was $173.4 million compared to $167.7 million for the first nine months of 2017.
Income before income taxes was $68.2 million, or 15.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $55.5 million, or 17.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2017.
Income before income taxes for the first nine months of 2018 was $165.2 million, or 12.5% of net sales compared to $160.3 million, or 17.5% of net sales, for the first nine months of 2017.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above income before income taxes was favorably impacted by increases in foreign exchange gains of $4.9 million and increases in other income of $1.4 million primarily due to unrealized investment gains in our equity investments partially offset by higher interest expense of $7.1 million mainly resulting from increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
Income tax expense was $14.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 21.5%, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $12.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 22.9%, for the third quarter of 2017.
The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the acquisition of IXYS.
The Industrial segment net sales increased slightly by $0.1 million, or 0.4%, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher volume across the power fuse and relay businesses despite the full exit of the Custom business during the second quarter of 2018.
