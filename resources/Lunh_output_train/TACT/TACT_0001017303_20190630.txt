International sales for the second quarter of 2019 decreased $0.8 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 due primarily to a 27% decrease in sales in the international casino and gaming market.
terminal sales to two large corporate customers in the second quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur in the second quarter of 2019. software recognized on a SaaS subscription basis increased by 24% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2019.
The decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 26% decrease in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, largely to McDonald’s.
This decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the prior year period was due primarily to 49% lower sales of replacement parts including lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
This decrease was partially offset by increases in our service revenue of 49% and label sales related to our restaurant solutions products of 131%.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 50% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers.
For the second quarter of 2019, gross profit decreased $1.3 million, or 18%, due to a 23% decline in sales during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
This decrease in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in our gross margin of 290 basis points in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
During the second quarter of 2019, higher compensation expenses, related to the hiring of additional outside and technical sales and marketing staff to support the expected growth in our restaurant solutions business, were almost entirely offset by decreased marketing expenses in our other markets.
General and administrative expenses increased $80 thousand, or 4%, for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses.
These increases were partially offset by lower recruiting expense incurred during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to additional investment to support restaurant solutions.
We recorded net interest expense of $7 thousand in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $6 thousand in the second quarter of 2018.
