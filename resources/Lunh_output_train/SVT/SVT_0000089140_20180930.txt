During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 approximately 7% and 9% respectively, of the Company’s revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors.
The Company’s consolidated revenue from operations increased approximately $5,229,000 or 17.4% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
The consolidated revenue increase for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is primarily attributed to ATG with increased number of units shipped of approximately $3,091,000 and average price increases of approximately $2,969,000.
This is offset by a decrease in revenue at the CPG due to a decrease in the number of units shipped of approximately $456,000 and average price decreases of approximately $375,000 as compared to the same nine month period ended September 30, 2017.
The Company’s consolidated revenue from operations increased approximately $1,443,000 or 12.7% for the three month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
The consolidated revenue increase for the three month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is primarily attributed to increased average prices of approximately $1,155,000 and increased number of units shipped of approximately $566,000 at the ATG.
The decrease in revenue at the CPG is primarily attributed to average price decreases of approximately $352,000 offset slightly by volume increases of approximately $74,000 as compared to the same three month period ended September 30, 2017.
The Company’s consolidated gross margin increased approximately $2,177,000 or 32.3% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 and increased approximately $849,000 or 27.4% for the three month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.
Gross margin improved in the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the increase in units shipped of approximately $1,256,000 and increased average prices of approximately $1,030,000 at the ATG as compared to the same period in 2017.
Gross margin improved in the three month period ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the increased number of units shipped of approximately $228,000 and increased average prices of approximately $726,000 at the ATG as compared to the same period in 2017.
This is partially offset by a decrease in average prices of approximately $108,000 offset slightly by an increase in units shipped of approximately $3,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period in 2017.
This increase is primarily the result of increases in revenue at the ATG business segment offset by a decrease in revenue at the CPG business segment as discussed above.
The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 includes working capital requirements, increased receivables due to timing of shipments and payments by customers and increase in inventory raw materials for increased production offset by timing differences on payments to vendors.
