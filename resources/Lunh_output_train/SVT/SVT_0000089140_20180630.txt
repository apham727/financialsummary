The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $2,330,000 or 24.2% for the three month period ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.

This is due in part to the mix of product, but primarily due to the increase in revenue for the period ended June 30, 2018 from the same period in 2017.
In addition, depreciation and amortization increased by 17.1% and 9.9% for the six and three month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively, from the same period in 2017, primarily due to additional machinery and equipment procured for the ATG increase in production.
This is primarily due to the lease line of credit for the equipment financing for the ATG increase in production.

This increase is primarily the result of increases in revenue at the ATG business segment offset by a decrease in revenue at the CPG business segment as discussed above.
The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the six month period ended June 30, 2018 includes working capital requirements, increased receivables due to timing of shipments offset by timing differences on payments to vendors.
