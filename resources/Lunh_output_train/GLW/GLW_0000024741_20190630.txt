Under the Framework, we targeted generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.
As of June 30, 2019, Corning met its goal of returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and is on track to invest $11 billion for growth and extended leadership.
From 2020 to 2023, the company plans to invest $10 billion to $12 billion for growth and to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders.
Net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $2,940 million and $5,752 million, compared to $2,747 million and $5,247 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2018.
Growth from multi-year hyperscale data center projects drove the increase in enterprise sales in both periods.
Sales in carrier networks were down in the three months and up in the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division (“CMD”), which took place during the second quarter of 2018, also contributed to sales growth.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $68 million and $141 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, with volume increases in the mid-teens in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines.
Diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.69 per share when compared to the second quarter of 2018, driven by the decrease in net income described, offset by the repurchase of 35.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
The increases in net income outlined above were offset by other net charges and credits of $20 million, primarily driven by accelerated depreciation within the Display Technologies segment and other corporate charges.
Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.53 per share when compared to the first half of 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, offset by the repurchase of 35.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
We believe 2019 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework and recently introduced Strategy and Growth Framework.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase by a low-to-mid-single digit percentage, including the impact of a full year of sales from the acquisition of CMD.
We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on the adoption of our innovations.
Movements in foreign exchange rates decreased Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $34 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
Movements in foreign exchange rates decreased Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $59 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, gross margin decreased by $7 million and 1% and increased by $137 million or 7%, respectively.
When compared to the second quarter of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses were similar in the three months ended June 30, 2019.
When compared to the first half of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $98 million, or 11%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant as a percentage of sales at 14% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.
As a percentage of sales, these expenses decreased by 1% and remained constant, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year.
Equity in earnings of affiliated companies for the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $12 million, driven primarily by the absence of a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from a legal settlement.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
As of June 30, 2019, the company is not expecting any significant movements in the uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months.
