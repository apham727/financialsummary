However, the concentration of our business in the rail industry, and in equipment for military applications and industrial applications, and our customer concentrations expose us to on-going associated risks.
These risks include, without limitation, requirements for power supplies in the rail industry, dependence on appropriations from the United States Government and the governments of foreign nations, program allocations, the potential of governmental termination of orders for convenience, and the general strength of the industry sectors in which our customers transact business.
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff.
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2019 to be higher than revenues during fiscal year 2018 but expects the gross profit margin to be lower in fiscal year 2019 than the gross profit margin during fiscal year 2018.
New orders received in the first six months of fiscal year 2019 were approximately $13.4 million as compared to $14.3 million of new orders received in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $24.4 million of orders comprising the December 31, 2018 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
The minimum of $24.4 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
The estimate of the December 31, 2018 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2019 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing approximately $60.0 million in the aggregate as of January 31, 2019 for both repeat and new programs.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any of the anticipated orders described above, many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry.
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 49.4% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2018 and net sales to three significant customers represented 63.2% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 54.4% and 61.0% of the Company’s total sales for the six-month period ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable.
When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time, or were negotiated with an overall profit objective.
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligation.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.
The costs attributed to units delivered under contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced.
For the three months ended December 31, 2018, the decline in net sales is primarily due to a decrease in power supply shipments on a specific military contract and a decrease in shipments supporting the rail industry.
For the six months ended December 31, 2018, the decrease in net sales is primarily due to the timing of power supply shipments related to a specific military contract which had significant shipments in the prior fiscal year, offset in part by an increase in build to print sales.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” meaning engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales.
The gross profit percentage decreased in the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to the impact of incurred spending related to a specific engineering design contract.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,295,687 for the three months ended December 31, 2018; an increase of $313,317, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017.
