The amendments in ASU 2018-07 expand the scope of Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees, and provide that non-employee share-based payment awards be measured at their grant-date fair value and the probability of satisfying performance conditions be taken into account when non-employee share-based payment awards contain such conditions.

During the three months ended March 31, 2019, approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S. As the U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, it results in a relative price increase or decrease for certain of our products that are priced in U.S. dollars in a foreign location.
Generally, as the costs of inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices, we raise selling prices to customers to cover the increase in costs, resulting in higher sales revenue but a lower gross profit percentage.
Therefore, all references to the effect of copper prices or other commodity prices are estimates.
Our channel partners and customers purchase and hold the products they bought from us in their inventory in order to meet the service and on-time delivery requirements of their customers.
We use information provided to us by our channel partners and make certain assumptions based on our sales to them to determine the amount of products they bought from us and hold in their inventory.
To the extent that we exceed the market growth rates, we consider it to be the result of capturing market share.
We recognized $3.0 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three months ended March 31, 2019.

Gross profit decreased $5.9 million, or 2.5%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 due to the decreases in revenues discussed above as well as a $0.7 million increase in the amortization of software development intangible assets.
The aforementioned adverse impacts on gross profit were partially offset by decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs and purchase accounting effects of acquisitions of $8.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as compared to the year ago period.
