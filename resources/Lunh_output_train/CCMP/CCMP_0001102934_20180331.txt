Cabot Microelectronics Corporation ("Cabot Microelectronics'', "the Company'', "us'', "we'', or "our'') supplies high-performance polishing slurries and pads used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit (IC) devices within the semiconductor industry, in a process called chemical mechanical planarization (CMP).
We develop, manufacture and sell CMP polishing pads, which are used in conjunction with slurries in the CMP process.
For additional information, refer to Part 1, Item 1, "Business", in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by Cabot Microelectronics pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
In the opinion of management, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of Cabot Microelectronics' financial position as of March 31, 2018, cash flows for the six months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, and results of operations for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.
The accounting estimates that require management's most difficult and subjective judgments include, but are not limited to, those estimates related to bad debt expense, inventory valuation, valuation and classification of auction rate securities, impairment of long-lived assets and investments, business combinations, goodwill, other intangible assets, interest rate swaps, share-based compensation, income taxes and contingencies.
The adjustments, relating primarily to accumulated earnings taxes of a foreign operation, increased the income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by $2,071.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company entered into a managed investment arrangement with a third party to invest in fixed income securities.
The Company recognized a loss of $118 associated with the sale of these investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established a three-level hierarchy for disclosure based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair value.
Level 1 inputs consist of valuations based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs consist of valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an inactive market, or other observable inputs.
The following table presents financial instruments, other than long-term debt, that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017.
We have classified the following assets and liabilities in accordance with the fair value hierarchy set forth in the applicable standards.
In instances where the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset fall into more than one level of the hierarchy, we have classified them based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
Our cash and cash equivalents consist of various bank accounts used to support our operations and investments in institutional money-market funds that are traded in active markets.

The enactment of the Tax Act in the United States in December 2017 facilitated the Company's repatriation of a substantial amount of its non-U.S. cash and available-for-sale securities during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and following the end of the quarter in early April.
Revenue for our second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $143.0 million, which represented an increase of 20.0% from the second quarter of fiscal 2017, with revenue in dielectrics slurries and polishing pads product areas increasing 24.0% and 22.6% from the same quarter last year, respectively.
Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 expressed as a percentage of revenue was 52.5%, compared to 50.4% for our second quarter of fiscal 2017, including 90 and 100-basis point of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively.
Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 52.7% of revenue, compared to 50.1% during the same period last year, which includes 90 and 100-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively.
We currently expect our gross profit margin for the full fiscal year 2018 to be between 51% and 53%, an increase from our prior full year guidance range of 50% to 52%.
Operating expenses were $38.0 million in our second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $36.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included $0.5 million in NexPlanar amortization expense.
We currently expect operating expenses for full fiscal year 2018 to be between $148.0 million and $153.0 million, an increase from our prior full year guidance range of $145.0 million to $150.0 million.

While we are not involved in any legal proceedings that we believe will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, we periodically become a party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
We do not believe there have been any material changes in our risk factors since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
For example, the strengthening of demand conditions in the semiconductor industry we experienced during the second half of fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2017 continued through our second quarter of fiscal 2018, following relatively soft demand conditions during the second half of fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016.
