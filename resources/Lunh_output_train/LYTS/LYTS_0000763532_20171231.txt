The accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these financial statements.
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements include all normal adjustments and disclosures necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of  December 31, 2017, the results of its operations for the three and six month periods ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, and its cash flows for the six month periods ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016.
In certain arrangements with customers, as is the case with the sale of some of our solid-state LED (light emitting diode) video screens, revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the video screen at the job site.
Product revenue related to orders where the customer requires the Company to install the product is recognized when the product is installed.
Revenue from the management of media content and digital hardware related to active digital signage is recognized evenly over the service period with the customer.
In situations where the Company is responsible for re-imaging programs with multiple sites, each site is viewed as a separate unit of accounting and has stand-alone value to the customer.
Revenue is recognized upon the Company’s complete performance at the location, which  may include a site survey, graphics products, lighting products, and installation of products.
The selling price assigned to each site is based upon an agreed upon price between the Company and its customer and reflects the estimated selling price for that site relative to the selling price for sites with similar image requirements.
The Company also evaluates the appropriateness of revenue recognition in accordance with the accounting standards on software revenue recognition.
The Company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by first considering all known collectability problems of customers’ accounts, and then applying certain percentages against the various aging categories based on the due date of the remaining receivables.
The Company first determines its obsolete inventory reserve by considering specific known obsolete items, and then by applying certain percentages to specific inventory categories based upon inventory turns.
A combination of financial modeling and qualitative input factors are used to establish excess and obsolete inventory reserves and management adjusts these reserves as more information becomes available about the ultimate disposition of the inventory item.
