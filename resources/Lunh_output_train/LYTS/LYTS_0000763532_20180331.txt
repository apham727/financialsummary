The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements include all normal adjustments and disclosures necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of March 31, 2018, the results of its operations for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and its cash flows for the nine month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
In certain arrangements with customers, as is the case with the sale of some of our solid-state LED (light emitting diode) video screens, revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the video screen at the job site.
Product revenue related to orders where the customer requires the Company to install the product is recognized when the product is installed.
Revenue from the management of media content and digital hardware related to active digital signage is recognized evenly over the service period with the customer.
In situations where the Company is responsible for re-imaging programs with multiple sites, each site is viewed as a separate unit of accounting and has stand-alone value to the customer.
Revenue is recognized upon the Company’s complete performance at the location, which may include a site survey, graphics products, lighting products, and installation of products.
The selling price assigned to each site is based upon an agreed upon price between the Company and its customer and reflects the estimated selling price for that site relative to the selling price for sites with similar image requirements.
The Company also evaluates the appropriateness of revenue recognition in accordance with the accounting standards on software revenue recognition.
The Company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by first considering all known collectability problems of customers’ accounts, and then applying certain percentages against the various aging categories based on the due date of the remaining receivables.
The Company first determines its obsolete inventory reserve by considering specific known obsolete items, and then by applying certain percentages to specific inventory categories based upon inventory turns.
A combination of financial modeling and qualitative input factors are used to establish excess and obsolete inventory reserves and management adjusts these reserves as more information becomes available about the ultimate disposition of the inventory item.
The Company recorded $1,825,000 and $1,725,000 of depreciation expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $5,569,000 and $5,122,000 of depreciation expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Neither indefinite-lived intangible assets nor the excess of cost over fair value of assets acquired ("goodwill") are amortized, however they are subject to review for impairment.
Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment analyses, long-lived asset impairment analyses, and in the purchase price of acquired companies (if any).

Comparable fiscal 2018 net sales excluding net sales from Atlas Lighting Products, Inc. (“Atlas”) decreased by $4.8 million or 6.7% compared to fiscal 2017 net sales.
The Company also recorded an impairment expense of $479,000, acquisition costs of $1,480,000, and a gain on the sale of one of its facilities of $1,361,000 in selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 with no corresponding event in fiscal 2018.
Fiscal 2018 nine month operating loss of $(19,524,000) represents a $22.6 million change from operating income of $3,110,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
The change from operating income in fiscal 2017 to an operating loss in fiscal 2018 is primarily the result of a $28 million goodwill impairment in fiscal 2018 with no corresponding event in fiscal 2017.
Also contributing to the year-over-year change from operating income in fiscal 2017 to an operating loss in fiscal 2018 is the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit and increased gross profit as a percentage of sales, and an increase in selling and administrative expenses.
Adjusted operating income, net income and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of a goodwill and intangible asset impairment, a tax charge related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets, restructuring and plant closure costs, acquisition deal costs, a fair market value inventory adjustment, and other severance costs, are non-GAAP financial measures.
The reconciliation of reported net income and earnings per share to adjusted net income and earnings per share may not agree due to rounding differences and due to the difference between basic and dilutive weighted average shares outstanding in the computation of earnings per share.
The Lighting Segment’s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $51.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, representing a $6.3 million or 14.0% increase from fiscal 2017 third quarter net sales of solid-state LED light fixtures of $44.9 million.
Light fixtures having solid-state LED technology represent 92.2% of total lighting product net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 81.8% of total lighting product net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.

Gross profit of $15,944,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1.0 million or 7.0% from the same period of fiscal 2017, and increased from 24.0% to 25.7% as a percentage of Lighting Segment net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales).
Selling and administrative expenses of $12,962,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $2.2 million or 20.3% from the same period of fiscal 2017, primarily as the net result of acquiring Atlas in February 2017.
