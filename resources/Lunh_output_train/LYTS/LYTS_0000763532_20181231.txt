Fiscal 2019 second quarter operating loss of $(20.3) million represents a $24.8 million change from operating income of $4.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $24.8 million change from operating income in fiscal 2018 to an operating loss in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Fiscal 2019 first half operating loss of $(17.3) million represents a $2.9 million improvement from an operating loss of $(20.3) million in the first half of fiscal 2018.
Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million.
Gross profit of $14,742,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $4.5 million or 23% from the same period of fiscal 2018, and decreased from 27.4% to 22.8% as a percentage of Lighting Segment net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales).
Selling and administrative expenses of $33,194,000 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 increased $19.2 million from the same period of fiscal 2018 selling and administrative expenses of $13,984,000, primarily due to the $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
The Lighting Segment second quarter fiscal 2019 operating loss of $(18,452,000) decreased $23.7 million from operating income of $5,275,000 in the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a $20.2 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge.
Graphics Segment net sales of $25,887,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $2.8 million or 12% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $23,131,000.
Gross profit as a percentage of segment net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales) decreased from 25% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to 19% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
The Graphics Segment second quarter fiscal 2019 operating income of $861,000 decreased $1.4 million or 62% from operating income of $2,255,000 in the same period of fiscal 2018.
The change is primarily the result of a reduction in wage and benefit expense partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees.
The Company reported $615,000 net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $417,000 net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The change in interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit and higher commitment fees on its unused portion of the line of credit.
