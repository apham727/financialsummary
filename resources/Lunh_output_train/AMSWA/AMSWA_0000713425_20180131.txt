Global output is estimated to have grown by 3.7 percent in 2017, which is 0.1 percentage point faster than projected in the fall and  1⁄2 percentage point higher than in 2016.
The revision reflects increased global growth momentum and the expected impact of the recently approved U.S. tax policy changes. For the remainder of fiscal 2018, we expect the global economy to improve when compared to the prior year, which could result in an improved selling environment.
We believe the improvement in economic conditions may be driving some businesses to invest in achieving more process and efficiency enhancements in their operations and to invest in solutions that improve operating margins, rather than make large infrastructure-type technology purchases.
If this trend continues, we believe it may tend to favor solutions such as our Logility supply chain solutions, which are designed to provide a more rapid return on investment and are targeted at some of the largest profit drivers in a customers business.
The SCM segment, consists of Logility, which provides supply chain optimization and advance retail planning solutions, as an integrated suite of sales and operations planning, demand optimization, inventory optimization, manufacturing planning and scheduling, supply optimization, retail allocation and merchandise planning and transportation optimization, as well as (i) DMI, which provides collaborative supply chain solutions to streamline and optimize the forecasting, inventory, production, supply, allocation, distribution and management of products between trading partners, (ii) New Generation Computing (NGC), which provides cloud solutions for supply chain management, product lifecycle management, quality control, vendor compliance and enterprise resource planning for both retailers and manufacturers in the apparel, sewn products and furniture industries, and, (iii) Halo, which provides advanced analytics and business intelligence solutions for the supply chain market.

The Company has performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and is monitoring the activity of the FASB as it relates to specific interpretive guidance.
Therefore, the new standard would require additional disclosures of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the fiscal year 2019 reporting period.
In assessing the new standard, the Company has completed its review of representative contracts and identification of policy and differences resulting from the adoption of the new revenue standard.
The 14% increase in revenues over the three months ended January 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year was attributable primarily to a 50% increase in license fee revenues and, to a lesser extent, a 9% increase in services and other revenues and a 5% increase in maintenance revenues.
The increase in license fee revenues was attributable to entering into several license fee agreements during the quarter in our SCM segment, due to an increase in general economic activity and higher overall business information technology spending from the US tax reform.
