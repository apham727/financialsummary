Effective with the first quarter of 2019, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system.
Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period’s currency conversion rate.
Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.
The company’s reportable segment financial results reflect pre-tax operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with the company’s management and measurement system.
Total cloud revenue of $5.0 billion in the third quarter of 2019 grew 11 percent as reported and 12 percent adjusted for currency.
Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 15.9 percent year to year, driven primarily by the higher spending described above.
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was (9.9) percent, a decrease of 20.1 points compared to the third quarter of 2018.
The year-to-year decrease was primarily driven by a benefit from the realization of a tax only capital loss in a subsidiary (10.7 points), an increase in tax benefits attributable to audit activity (4.3 points), as well as a benefit due to the mix of geographic income year to year (5.0 points), primarily driven by Red Hat.
Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion decreased 33.4 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 5.9 points to 13.3 percent.
Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion decreased 23.6 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 13.3 percent, down 3.4 points year to year.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.87 in the third quarter of 2019 decreased 36.4 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $2.68 decreased 21.6 percent versus the third quarter of 2018.
In the third quarter of 2019, the company repurchased 0.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $0.1 billion and had $2.0 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization at September 30, 2019.
In the third quarter of 2019, investing activities were a net use of cash of $30.4 billion compared to $3.0 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by cash used for the Red Hat acquisition.
The $7.7 billion increase in financing cash outflows year to year was driven by net cash related to debt transactions.
