On May 8, 2018, we announced that we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of May 7, 2018, by and among Cohu, Xavier Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cohu (“Merger Sub”) and Xcerra Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (“Xcerra”).
We currently anticipate that we will close the Merger by the end of 2018, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions for the Merger will be satisfied or waived.
The Merger cannot be completed until the conditions are satisfied or waived, including receipt of our stockholders’ approval of the issuance of additional shares of Cohu common stock as consideration in the Merger, receipt of Xcerra’s stockholders’ approval of the Merger, receipt of required antitrust and other regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions.
Whether or not we complete the Merger, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger, including payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related financing transactions.
These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Furthermore, we may incur material restructuring charges in connection with the Merger, which may adversely affect our operating results following the closing of the Merger in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Xcerra, which is a complex, costly and time-consuming process.
In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated.
As a result, it cannot be assured that the Merger will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.
Completion of the Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and we cannot provide assurance that these approvals will be obtained.
If any conditions or changes to the proposed structure of the Merger are required to obtain these regulatory approvals, they may have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of the Merger or reducing the anticipated benefits of the Merger.

During the first three months of 2018, our net sales increased 11% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and 17% from the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in sales was driven by market share gains for semiconductor test handlers used for testing devices used in mobility and IoT (Internet of Things) and automotive markets.
We are continuing our investment in new products and are focused on growing our market share in the semiconductor test handling and test contactor markets, and expanding into the semiconductor inspection market.
On May 8, 2018, we announced that we entered into the Merger Agreement, dated as of May 7, 2018, by and between Cohu and Xcerra.
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Xcerra Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger will be converted into the right to receive $9.00 in cash, without interest, and 0.2109 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Cohu Common Stock.

As we classify our short-term securities as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.

Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.
