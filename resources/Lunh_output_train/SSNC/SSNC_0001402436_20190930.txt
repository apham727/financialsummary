These accounting principles were applied on a basis consistent with those of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 1, 2019 (the “2018 Form 10-K”).
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, except as noted elsewhere in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) necessary for a fair statement of our financial position as of September 30, 2019, the results of our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, and our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed us to not reassess existing contracts to determine if they contain a lease and to carry forward their historical lease classification upon transition.
In addition, we will not apply the guidance of ASC 842 to leases with an initial term of 12 months or less as allowed by the standard.
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets and lease payment obligations for our real estate office leases of $387.6 million and $417.8 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019.
As of September 30, 2019, $55.5 million of the lease liability was included in other accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
ASU 2016-13 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
A lease is identified when a contract allows us the right to control an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Our operating leases are included on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities.
An operating lease asset represents our right to use an underlying asset over the term of a lease while an operating lease liability represents our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease assets are also recognized at the commencement date as the total operating lease liability adjusted for prepaid rents, deferred rent liabilities and lease fair value adjustments that existed under ASC 840.

Our revenues increased $151.8 million, or 15.3%, primarily due to our acquisitions, which included Eze Software Group, LLC (“Eze”) and Intralinks Holdings, Inc. (“Intralinks”) in the fourth quarter of 2018, which, combined, contributed $147.8 million in revenues.
Software-enabled services revenues increased $132.7 million, or 16.0%, primarily due to the acquisitions, which added revenues of $146.9 million, as well as from a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services and services for advisory and wealth managers.
License, maintenance and related revenues increased $19.1 million, or 11.6%, primarily due to increased license revenues for institutional and investment management products, as well as the acquisitions, which added revenues of $0.9 million.
Software-enabled services revenues increased $1,031.0 million, or 55.3%, primarily due to the acquisitions, which contributed $1,051.7 million to the increase in revenues, as well as from a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services and services for advisory and wealth managers.
License, maintenance and related revenues increased $88.3 million, or 19.8%, primarily due to increased license revenues for institutional and investment management products and advisory and wealth management products, as well as the acquisitions, which contributed $41.1 million to the increase in revenues.
We had net interest expense of $98.5 million and $304.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to $78.1 million and $173.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
The increase in interest expense, net for 2019 as compared to 2018 relates primarily to increased borrowings in connection with our acquisitions of DST, Eze and Intralinks and, to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates.
We had other expense, net of $10.3 million and other income, net of $27.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, other income, net included investment gains and dividend income of $12.1 million and $13.4 million, respectively.
We had equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of $(0.1) million and $2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to $1.7 million and $2.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
We recorded a $7.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 in connection with the repayment of a portion of our Term Loans with the proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Notes.
The Senior Notes are discussed further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” We recorded a $44.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement.
The change in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily due to our acquisition of DST in April 2018 and the relative impact of permanent book to tax differences on reduced pre-tax book income in 2018 that occurred as a result.
Our principal cash requirements are to finance the costs of our operations pending the billing and collection of client receivables, to fund payments with respect to our indebtedness, to invest in research and development, to acquire complementary businesses or assets and to pay dividends on our common stock.
