The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Jabil Inc. (the Company) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017.
The Company calculates its basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to Jabil Inc. by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
The difference between the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding and the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to dilutive unvested restricted stock awards and dilutive stock appreciation rights.
As a result of the modification, 0.8 million awards vested during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which resulted in approximately $24.9 million of stock-based compensation expense recognized.
In July 2017, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $450.0 million of the Companys common stock (the 2017 Share Repurchase Program).
As of May 31, 2018, 11.5 million shares had been repurchased for $316.2 million and $133.8 million remains available under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program.
In June 2018, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350.0 million of the Companys common stock (the 2018 Share Repurchase Program).
During the nine months ended May 31, 2018, the Companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 50% of its net revenue and 77 customers accounted for approximately 90% of its net revenue.
Transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which the Company would transact with third parties.
Total foreign net revenue represented 91.2% and 91.8% of net revenue during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, compared to 90.6% and 91.3% of net revenue during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.
(2)  The Senior Notes are the Companys senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.
(3)  During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company issued $500.0 million of publicly registered 3.950% Senior Notes due 2028 (the 3.950% Senior Notes).
The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including to redeem $400.0 million of the Companys outstanding 8.250% Senior Notes due 2018 and pay related costs and a make-whole premium.
Fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders and a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit.
The estimated fair values of the Companys publicly traded debt, including the 5.625%, 4.700% and 3.950% Senior Notes, were approximately $419.5 million, $514.1 million and $481.7 million, respectively, as of May 31, 2018.
The carrying amounts of borrowings under credit facilities and under loans approximate fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates.
