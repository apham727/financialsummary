GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted from these condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations, including the interim reporting requirements, of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, except as discussed in “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” below.
In connection with the adoption, we elected to utilize the Comparatives Under 840 Option whereby the Company will continue to present prior period financial statements and disclosures under ASC 840.
Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less) and an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets.
The change in balance of our unbilled receivables from December 31, 2018 to September 30, 2019 primarily relates to a timing difference between the Company’s performance (i.e. when our product is shipped to a customer-controlled hub) and the point at which the Company can invoice the customer per the terms of the customer contract (i.e. when the customer pulls our product from the customer-controlled hub).
The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of September 30, 2019 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $15.7 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2020 - 2025.
It is expected that 20% of this aggregate amount will be recognized in 2020, 57% will be recognized in 2021 and the remainder will be recognized in years beyond 2021.
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale securities primarily consisted of investments held in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) obligations.
These securities are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs and amounted to $1.2 million at September 30, 2019 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2018.
The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018.
There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018.
The Company has other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature.
The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of total debt was $116.8 million and $117.9 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $112.3 million and $114.2 million, respectively.

After record bookings throughout 2018, the Company has experienced slower bookings during the first nine months of 2019 as customers work through their inventory on hand.
The Company has also experienced margin pressure throughout 2019 due to lower sales volumes and high material costs from 2018 which continue to run through the Company’s statement of operations.
Sales declines in each of our segments during the third quarter of 2019 reflected lower sales into our distribution channel as our distribution partners continue to work down their level of inventory on hand.
Sales in our Asia segment in the third quarter of 2019 were down versus 2018 as a result of customers working down heightened inventory levels which had been built up during 2018 in response to new product launches and the tariffs that went into effect in 2018 and 2019.
Net sales and (loss) income from operations by operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows.
Sales of our Connectivity Solutions products during the third quarter of 2019 declined $4.0 million primarily due to lower demand from military customers as compared to last year's third quarter, and reduced volume of product flowing through our distribution channels as our distribution partners continue to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs.
These factors also impacted the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019, which declined $8.9 million from the same period of 2018, partially offset by higher sales to commercial aerospace customers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Sales of our Magnetic Solutions products during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were down $13.3 million and $18.0 million, respectively, from the same periods of 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a customer's new program launch during 2018 are worked through.
Sales of our Power Solutions and Protection products were $4.7 million lower in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018.
Sales during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $1.2 million from the same period of 2018, as stronger sales into datacenter applications during the first quarter of 2019 lessened the impact of sales declines during the second and third quarters of 2019.
