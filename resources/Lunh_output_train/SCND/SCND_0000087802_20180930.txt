The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Scientific Industries, Inc., Altamira Instruments, Inc. (“Altamira”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, and Scientific Bioprocessing, Inc. (“SBI”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, and Scientific Packaging Industries, Inc., an inactive wholly-owned subsidiary (all collectively referred to as the “Company”).
The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Trade accounts receivable, current of $67,100 and $278,200, and trade accounts receivable, long term of $245,400 for both periods were reclassified to contract assets, current; and contract assets, less current portion, respectively, on the balance sheet as of September 30, and June 30, 2018.

Approximately 49% and 46% of net sales of benchtop laboratory equipment for the three month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories.
The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments.
The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria.
The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables.

The benchtop laboratory equipment sales reflected $425,300 of Torbal brand product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $304,200 in the three months ended September 30, 2017 as a result of continued growth in sales of the new force gauges product line.
Sales of catalyst research instruments increased by $188,800 to $217,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $28,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 because there were no large orders shipped during the prior year period.
